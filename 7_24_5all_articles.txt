It doesn’t help that the whole thing is being run by 80+ year gargoyles, a cadre of useful idiots stupid enough to actually believe their bullshit and an army of dei hires. That’s why everything seems like it’s falling apart, there’s no one, good or bad, competent enough to hold the shit show masquerade together anymore.

What happens???

Draft for all the loser Millennials/Gen Z: jobs corp if lucky, Iran if not. Equality achieved. Learn Spanish

US defaults(soft) and Dollar and Hyperinflates, Gold repriced and Debt-GDP ratio drops to 80% down from 130%. Wages go up(finally), S&P and other markets drop after Fed cuts Rates. Emerging Markets grow?

US re-industrializes. Learn a skill, slob.

All those military aged men let in across the border get drafted for citizenship. Just like Starship Troopers.

DEI and ESG fall off, Nuclear is the new thing. Deadbeat Welfare 'moms' get the boot because the US is insolvent.

Trump cuts Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid, dont worry, both were insolvent anyways. Boomers start dropping en masse due to unknown reasons definitely not related to the jab.

New US Currency is tokenized - if you suck you lose purchasing power even if you spend nothing. Read that Bible section about the Parable of the Talents. Sadly, people seek serfdom.

With above a UBI is instated but its for the poors...initially. After beta test is seems ok and expands. Can you Serve? Saturn? God? Fellow Man? If not, sucks to be you. Will the slimey politicians tighten their own noose?

Isreal sides with BRICS if Poland - Ukraine - Israel cant contain Russia. Whats Turkey doing?

Its still about Oil, even though Nuclear grows like mad to supply AI Data Centers.

Immediately - "The water tower?"

If she can see the risk the water tower was, any DEI hire could. This was done on purpose.

Assassination attempts will continue and they're going to really enrage the MAGA crowd. Don is going to want a private security detail for this one since Secret Service fucked up.

I'm glad to see that the causal adjustments that were attempted to be made didn't work. All of those hateful dirtbags invested billions into taking him down (and through many paranormal and metaphysical means) and it has yet to work. As with all investing, it carries risk. You can lose everything. They're not aware of the risk they're exposing themselves to because there is no good outcome for the incumbent DEI shabbos goys or their followers if Trump becomes martyred. The people who can carry on Trump's vision are far more violent and far less diplomatic, and they will also introduce their own ideals, which will look way more different than Donald's.

Oh well, it was going to be a shooting war anyways. That pendulum swing back might actually swing back so hard that people will attempt to erase history.HSXSH

They can provide hundreds of thousands of FPV drone drones to Ukraine yet not a single one can be used to keep an eye on the singular unsecured building in the vicinity of Trump?
They had snipers that on opposing rooftop they could blow his head off in a matter of seconds from the moment he started taking shots no problem but you're telling be they never thought or were ordered to maybe keep an eye on the only other rooftop nearby that wasn't being actively guarded?

not securing a roof top only 150 yeards away, sloppy.
not being quick to investigate reports of gunman on roof.
not giving the sniper the go to shoot a gunman on the roof.

best case it's a DEI problem, worst case they wanted to see what would happen.
.there is tighter security at a Taylor Swift concert, if it had been her, the would be assassin would have been gunned down before he even got to the roof.

It's gotten incredibly sloppy after it's changed hands and leadership and now accounting for DEI hiring it's become a complete disaster.

So democrats routinely tell their party members to register as Republicans to vote for candidates the democrats think they can beat, or a more democrat friendly candidate.

Yeah it was totally all staged for a photo op. It was a very simple plan involving someone taking a shot at Trump from 400 ft away and only hitting his ear. That plan would in no way have a 99% chance of having the shooter either miss entirely or spread Trump's brains onto the crowd behind him. This was in no way just crass incompetence from a DEI'ed lazy SS and the aftermath of brainwashing half the country into thinking that a second Trump term would be the literal end of American democracy. You figured it all out. Good job. Great critical thinking. The average IQ around here is in no way 85. You're all brilliant, especially (you).

>Democrats are seasoned Bolsheviks
Both parties are the Party of Capital but appeal to different acquired/learned sentiments in the masses using tailored rhetoric for each because the elite know the fundamental contradiction in society is not principally race or religion but ownership of capital

Neoliberal vs Neoconservative vs New Left vs Far Right
>Same foreign policy
>Same economic policy

The central purpose of American politics is to shift political consciousness and organization away from an economic interpretation of national and human development, of health, family, happiness -- away from populism -- into fake-inflammatory "cultural wars" and id-pol (a form of censorship). This is why Wokeism, LGBT, CRT, DEI are elite-driven movements e.g. BlackRock because they are elite constructs imposed on the masses who resent their lot in life looking for something or someone to blame. The elite provides this target for them because it secures their own positions and divides those who would otherwise organize and unite against them.

Bolsheviks don't fit this framework. No American politicians are advocating for what the Bolsheviks pushed for. You are using the wrong frame of analysis. Events in America are driven by access to and the maintenance/expansion of Capital, not Bolshevism. The elite dawn whatever outer language and ideology they need to employ only insofar as it cements their position in the class structure as an expedient tool.

That's what this is all about. It's pure politics: lords vs serfs, master vs slave, owner vs laborer, creditor vs debter. It's the same essential struggle historic. A small class of society finds itself living on the backs of the masses and reaps wild profits from interest, privileged access and rent-seeking. The fact the elite are increasingly barbaric in their totalitarianism, lust for power and greed, is absolutely nothing new historically. No room or need for Bolsheviks here.

That's why there should've been cops stationed on every rooftop within range of Trump. This is psy-op all the way. And here's the kicker. DEI has now infilitrated psy-ops which means they can't even find competent patsy's anymore. Even when they make sure the stooge has a ladder and a clear line of sight AND the ability to shoot first. Come Monday, if Republicans in the House and Senate don't take some drastic measures and this shit just turns into a soundbite, then it proves to me they were in on it too and fully expected to be choosing their own candidate in 2 days.

Maybe that's less shocking at a Trump rally but even having one of these positions would be a little strange but all of them at the same time? It's not really a surprise that Destiny is bringing it up. I think it's still in poor taste to attack someone who is dead, mostly because it's pointless.

They're actually worthless because its surrounded by 100 niggers. You can only sell one piece of property for 1m before the market finds out that they bought a property in the hood and the entire stock is worthless.

Don't shoot. Don't sell.

Problem is, they didn't take into account the eventual shooter would be such a bad shot.

To get someone like Trump killed, all you have to do is weaken his security enough, and wait for one of the many rabid anti-Trump fanatics to have a pop at him.
Was the shooter part of a conspiracy? It doesn't really matter. What matters is that there was a conspiracy (and constant hysterical rhetoric) to give the would-be assassin means, motive and opportunity.

He was given a window of opportunity, and took it. His shot was inches away from killing Donald Trump, the likely incoming President.

Trump will probably now fix his security detail and start asking questions about who just tried to get him killed. He will also probably be the most powerful man in the world come November.

I'm glad I'm not one of the people who indirectly called for Trump's death, because they came for the King, and they missed.

Yup. Some say luck. Others say God. Regardless, the SS failed, completely. Was it on purpose? Was it because they were limited in how many agents could come? Was it DEI? They need to figure out why they failed and get their shit together.

some antifa fag with a rifle should NOT have been allowed to get atop any roof in the first place. but due to competency crisis, lack of smooth hiring process, DEI, feminism, etc. the team was understaffed. usually a sniper also has a Spotter, his partner, using binoculars to help him see when his eye is in the scope.

DEI. Three female SS agents on Trumps security detail seems highly suspect, though, like Biden is purposefully giving him all the unathletic DEI hires and fuckups. With how the shooter even managed to take a shot, because of the inaction of the SS agents, it just feels like foul play.

He had the shooter in his crosshairs. Shooter fires then SS pulls his head back then takes 3 shots with the tripod bouncing. It was probably the first shot that hit since his baby arms couldn't hold the riffle down. Had him in his sights - so did the other DEI hire next to him.

Oh we've got the DEI virus as well but that's just military. Our intelligence officers are an old boys club and quite exclusive, much like the SAS. They have tried and failed to drop the entry requirements to make it more open but again that's all failed. You're slightly behind us (we scrapped all the gender affirming crap and made it illegal to give children hormones etc) you will catch up. Although I think your departments like intelligence etc are far too big and have way too much influence. I personally don't think the woman was actively trying to "not protect" Trump, I genuinely think it's just a quota hire gone wrong, women are less likely to put themselves in danger, look at suicide rates. Men are more likely to accept lethality vs women, hence the women cowering out the way vs men that will take the bullet.

There are three possible explanations for what we saw, and I can't rule any of them out:

1. Failed lone shooter assassination attempt.
2. Failed deep state conspiracy assassination attempt.
3. Successful staged "assassination attempt."

There's evidence the Secret Service were complicit (which supports scenarios 2 or 3). The position the shooter was allowed to take implies this. The hesitation by the police sniper who took him out implies this. The reports that the SS were made aware of a potential shooter and took no action implies this. That's three strong pieces of evidence. In the words of Ian Fleming: "Once is happenstance, twice may be coincidence, but three times is enemy action."

There's also evidence the SS were compromsed by incompetence, and were not complicit but failed (in scenarios 1 or 2, or both). There's a new head of the SS. She supports the DEI MO. That promotes incompetence, which could've been a factor. The Biden administration attempted a bill to remove Trump's SS detail. If that's their attitude, the new head of the SS might've sabotaged Trump's SS detail by giving him incompetents. Scenarios 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive. Combining the constant rhetoric that Trump is a major threat to democracy etc., with a deliberate weakening of his personal security, would inevitably provide a lone assassin with means, motive and opportunity to kill Trump.

What would scenario 3, a staged "attempt" look like? Trump with a blood pack for his ear. A patsy, perhaps MKUltra'd, being given that position, and a gun, and his orders. He shoots blanks and is killed. Then agents (from any of a number of agencies) shoot a few supporters in the stands from a hidden position. Not too difficult to set up. Just another psyop by the deep state (of which Trump is a secret member).

tl;dr: I don't know what really happened.

I don't envy you.
Not because I think being white makes me innately better than you, because I am high IQ and wasn't raised by communists.
I don't think "oh how could a nigger have more money than me". I'm not saying DEI is bad because I want to "keep you down", I'm saying DEI is bad because I think everyone, regardless of the color of their skin, should be able to get hired with no government/banking bribes for discrimination attached.
I''m not humiliated by making less money than you. I've worked a lot of low paying jobs despite being well educated and I don't think I'm "too good for" them. I leave jobs because I don't like the work or the people or the pay, not some imaginary sense of being some sort of nobility.
I will never ask you for money or say you should be taxed to support me. I will never try to take away what is yours. I will live my whole life honest no matter how many people here, irl, in the government, or anywhere else tell me I'm a bigot or a sucker or a loser.

I couldn't care less and I'm not competing with you.
The lack of this outlook in other races and in women is what causes me to suspect that white men are on average better and more human than other people.

Also don't brag about casual sex, it's a disgrace to the human spirit.

They're trying to distract you from the reality that Trump's team has been requesting more man power for weeks, somehow didn't cover an obvious rooftop, didn't notice a ladder leading up to the roof, ignored people warning that there was a guy with a gun up there, and let him get off multiple shots before taking him out.

The only question at this point is whether is was gross, systemic incompetence due to dei hiring, or a conspiracy all the way to the top. Or both. One doesn't really preclude the other.

it is impossible that this was an accident. even as a lowly grunt in the NG pulling security the first thing you do is create a range card and get distances and reference points for your field of fire. You always have interlocking fields of fire and study your sector. the idea that they had weeks if not months to scout this area, have a SOP in place, and then fuck up this bad is laughable. Even with DEI and all of that nonsense the SS regularly trains counter sniping with army SF and other units. they are not slouches. maybe a wild shot at km distance in an area with high building density would be questionable but not outside the realm of possibility... I guess... but this type of protection is literal third world tier. I refuse to believe that it was solely due to negligence alone. The shooter's position is literally the ideal location/distance to take a controlled shot at POTUS. Too close, too much chaos and coverage from protective detail. Too far, you miss the shot. 150 meters with 5.56 out of an AR would be (and I don't condone this) a dream setup for this situation. There is 0% chance that they fucked up that bad on accident.

DEI has lead to vast levels of incompetencies in all sectors, and I'm sure the SS is no different. So it's very viable that they really were that incompetent.

Secret plot? Maybe. It's insane they didn't have that entire building secured. It wasnt like it was some building a half mile away, it was a little over 100 yards. And they have no shortage of MKUltrad leftists to use, plus not that many would have to be involved and they know incompetency is a good cover since DEI competency crisis +"senile Biden admin" works to their advantage.

Staged? Considered it, but a few things. 1, there was a dead shooter on the roof after. I have trouble figuring out how they could have pulled that off. 2, graze ear shot is almost impossibly difficult to pull off. So it would have had to been blanks, along with maybe a razor or fake ear or some other source of fake blood Trump would have used. But then, you had the dead person in the audience. This was an event with hundreds of thousands of direct witnesses. While most would be scrambling there would still be aftermath. Also, when Trump touches his ear, sees blood on his hand, he looks genuinely shocked and confused. The blood was on his hand BEFORE he dived down. So I don't believe it was staged.

Meritocracy is long dead. DEI and nepotism have taken its place.
The fact that some country bumpkin demonstrated not just better awareness of his surroundings but also came up with better ideas for securing the handful of buildings in the area tells you all you should need to know about the level of competence of the secret service.

Now consider that this is the level of competence of what's supposed to be one of the best trained and equipped security agencies in the world and you get an idea of just how retarded other federal, state, and local officials are in lesser roles - and just how retarded things will continue to get from here on out.

He specifically said "put trump in a bullseye" a few days ago.

100% this was interpreted as a kill command by glowniggers, who promptly allowed the antifa nigger to take a shot at Trump.

Of course, glowniggers and antifa are entirely staffed by DEI diversity hires now, and completely incompetent, so they failed.

They knew they couldn't win the election against Trump, and attempted to have him taken out so they wouldn't need to. But in failing, they've tipped their hand, and there is no way they can take another shot at Trump now, his security will be beefed up tenfold.

You know what, why don’t we just get the woman who voiced Cortana for Halo games to do a voice for Omni ChatGPT and we call her Cortana.

Problem solved. And we don’t need to bicker and wait on Hollywood and all the niggers there to get their secret cut.

And if it’s not yet obvious in terms of social-cultural and historic points of view of someone, fuck niggers.

SO LETS GET CORTANA!

This guy is paying attention. Basic security is to cover the rooftops. There's legitimate reports from at least half a dozen people trying to warn police presence to a man with a rifle on that roof up to five full minutes before the shooting started. This is either an extreme case of dei hiring gone completely wrong or complicity and foreknowledge with the assassination attempt. Either way, be afraid. It's one of two possibilities. Complete retards are running the show or literal evil.

Wow unholy shit niggers who are dei hires. KYS you stupid nigger retard, sound only travels at one velocity which only changes depending on the pressure of the medium but that’s already known so sound velocity is constant.

Anyways retard KYS, people use those kind of frequency graphs to not only tell the type of bullet and its velocity but given two or more spaced sound receivers, they can tell or predict where it was fired from too.

Fucking DEI hire, no nigger moron left behind imbeciles.

Also let’s not even pretend it was that scrawny 100 lb soaking wet shrimp bones who shot at Trump. Dipshit looks like it was his first time, motherfucker probably sent his rounds somewhere two miles down range because he isn’t used to recoil and they hit some barn. He is a psyopsed patsy designed to draw fire while the real shooters were the one who placed the near lethal to Trump rounds. But given they were DEI recruits after all, they don’t train them as well as they used to don’t they.

Nobody is good enough to reliably hit someone in the ear without damaging their head. The shot was intended to kill and missed, and the conspiracy that remains up in the air is why the SS and police allowed the shooter to act when being told "there is a shooter on that roof" by bystanders.
The secret service are DEI hires who were vetted to be loyal to Biden, and inherently anti-Trump. They allowed it to occur because they hate Trump.

It was a real attempt. What wasn't real was the DEI non-white assassins' credentials. The would be assassin was being red flagged by people in the crowd for minutes before he started shooting. The roof he was on also wasn't being covered. I would even wager that almost every major political rally would see such attempts if it wasn't for the glowies doing their job. They didn't do their job this time and that's where the questioning should be directed.

I can't figure out if it's a good thing or a bad thing, that I'm actually glad for once, that the USA military is nothing but incompetent DEI troon/fag/etc mutt troops. Kicking out all the patriotic white males, who simply followed orders and were skilled and highly competent. Both via the obama military coups to replace them with entitled, incompetent, unpatriotic DEI troons. Let alone the covid mandates, and making it so that the competent white males couldn't get promoted
> So that the multi-generational military families were unironically telling their next generation heirs to avoid the military for their first time in ages. This included minorities, as there were many skilled, competent, patriotic minority, multigenerational military families as well. None of them like what was happening to the military, and everyone in their families, told them to avoid the military like the kike induced black plague of europe

Then when war became imminent, they stopped their purely troon, fag & non-white military commercials, and started replacing them with purely white soldiers. This was a sign, and was retweeted and reposted everywhere, that the military was finally serious about having ability again. It was no longer the virtue signaling woke bullshit anymore. The kikes realized that they needed the skilled, patriotic conservatives again. Who would willingly risk their lives and safety, to defend the USA
>This was yet again proven, and their desperation was clear, when the woke military started begging the skilled patriotic goyim, to come back again. By offering to delete their dishonorable discharge for avoiding the ineffective, experimental mRNA covid vaxxes, which simply increased the risk of covid, didn't prevent spread & had countless deleterious effects to health.

This isn't true you stupid nigger. Even a lot of the peasants had been taught some basic literacy especially in England.

As for OP's argument... Intel and American chip making is crippled because of diversity but women and jeets and the need to give engineering management roles to DEI hires are a much bigger factor than Jews. Jews in tech tend to be actually smart... Jeets and women are not and cause nothing but problems. Getting rid of Jews would do nothing, getting rid of women DEI and jeets would be the start to fixing things.

Here's the deal Cornpop. Putin is represented by all of the contractors and badged homosexual DEI hires as Putler to the demoralized brainless masses of shitlib NPCs. He's described as kiked to the politically literate.

The truth is really somewhere in the middle but not the way the glownigger retard narrative goes. In reality, Putin is Hitlarian because the jewish financial system has declared total war on Russia and he seems to be countering the Greater Israel / Yinon Plan usurpation, genocide, and land theft. However, he remains the shabbos goy of the jew because he still promotes the religious cult of the holohoax, which was originally a Russian and British propaganda operation and is now a state enforced lie. It's a crime in Russia to dispute the holohoax, which is the linchpin of jewish psychological and political control over the US and Europe.

So you guys basically have it right but for the wrong reasons.

He himself refuses to step down, even and even if he does multiple swing states already have him on their ballot because the candidate needs to be chosen so far out in advance and can't be changed.
But even if we ignore those problems, they literally don't have anyone better, their own polling shows that nobody on the dem side has a better shot than biden, and he's unelectable, and his DEI VP kamala is the most unpopular VP in american history.

Stuff like this just fuels Neo-Marxists and other Commies. To some extent they are correct that the rich can get away with stuff that average people can't. There was a point in the US where the mighty can fall and that justice can be served. That is no longer the case.

We're truly in the 5th century of the Western Roman Empire. A major war might happen within our lifetime, economy is declining, competency crisis, DEI destroying educational standards, white demographics lowering and lowering each generation, we'll decay and our position will be all the more gone.

The corporate economy is a DEI infested, black rock funded, white male humiliation ritual. The internet e-celeb economy is a roastie and fag infested white male humiliation ritual. Gamers have true integrity because they force themselves to do difficult tasks for hours a day for the sheer sake of craft itself and not for monetary/material incentives. Gamers deserve to inherit the earth and enslave normies.

You are correct, but there's still plenty of platform with bringing back the American workforce, purging pajeets and H1B's, restoring the energy and manufacturing sectors, destroying DEI and the woke cult, and continuing to fight globalism, abortion, etc.. You'd think there would be more than enough issues to carry the right onto endless campaigns, so they could actually stop immigration and fix it.

We're in an artificial economy. Women get DEI preferential treatment at jobs. And government gibs. Women's wealth and status is artificially raised at the expense of men. So average women are under the illusion that they're too good for the average man and they don't need men . If we got rid of all the affirmative action bullshit and gibs women would quickly realize they do in fact need men and average men will suddenly look more appealing.

>Do you expect the voters to have competency in determining whether let's say the present ammo stocks are enough for the war or too small?
What was the competence of Adolf "let's open yet another front" Hitler? Or Vladimir "Kiev in three days, Warsaw in a week" Putin?

Preparing for possible war effort and reporting the state of such preparations is the job of mid level officials, in any kind of government, not the job of the top. The top decides if they go to war or don't go to war, based on given reports. They don't check every single garrison and armory.

Reckless or based on bad reporting decisions have happened in non democracies as well. What allows democracies to function are, if actually the populace sticks with them, principles of pluralism and meritocracy. Opposing viewpoints that have a chance to point out flaws in proposed solutions can be raised. Officials keep their positions not because of views, but because of competence. Their rivals have incentive to make sure if they do good job and report on a valid reason to have them replaced.

Democrats in US are fucked with Biden precisely because they didn't believe in meritocracy, only in DEI (have female black VP no matter how unpopular she is) and covering up during primaries for the weaknesses of their leader instead allowing him to be replaced. Obamism brought them to the current situation.

DEI isn't racial so much as it is low IQ goy slop. Yes white people over all have the highest IQ ( forged Chinese and Jewish numbers can fuck off, you invent / contribute nothing )

They can't have spaces like this where critical thinking is allowed. They can't have spaces like this where they and their faggot behavior are openly mocked.

This is a very warped viewing of America. In reality there's two cultures: fundamentalist anglo-christian and moderate liberal. Most are moderate liberals by the numbers, and this would be clear if America had a parliamentary system like Europe where the National Liberal Party and National Christian Democracy Party would win all elections and be the permanent ruling coalition government.

The culture war is recent and due to mass media, specifically television media then cable and the internet specifically smartphones. Neil Postman had much to say about this, how unrestricted commercial video media instigates extreme polarization. This has eventually resulted in the hellscape he predicted where there is only diversity DEI talk vs insane trump ramblings. It is slowly ending as liberals walk back their support for unrestricted media, and will begin regulating it again. Once this happens, the ability for extreme opinions to dominate based on engagement alone will end, and everything will stabilize.

OP, this is less a cultural question and more a technological question. Complete free speech failed. The technologies that enabled it such as television broadcasts, VHS tapes, and mp3 players are in decline and will die as streaming/cloud/network based services take over. AT&T's vision for computing via dummy terminals and a mainframe will come true, and in doing so force regulations on speech that stop the political infighting.

It's not so much the price it's the fact that having these movies on my harddrive is way more convenient than any corporate offering.
>no ads
>no buffering
>can get nearly any movie no matter how obscure
>no risk of losing these movies unless I personally screw up and don't make backups
>can easily copy over to other devices to watch elsewhere
>can categorize films exactly as I see fit
>don't have to concern myself with the fact I'm funding a woke DEI shitshow like Netflix that insists on shoving niggers into everything

niggers and spics generally achieve and earn less though. Asian men in their 40s have the highest individual income when you break it down by age but White men have the highest median individual income. What does DEI achieve besides for fucking over yuppie Whites that worked those jobs to begin with? Another demographic phenomenon that really threw me for a loop was the “S&P 100 Jobs going 94% to P*C” and I had to look into it.

It gets more fucked up when you realize that it's not just vidya that ESG/DEI infects, it's every aspect of society. Business, education, marketing, film, music, etc.

McCarthy really tried to stop it all(though I doubt even he knew the scope of what he was up against) but he was called crazy.

I hope when all is said and done, we can honor him properly as a true American hero. Tragic as his story was.

yea that doesn't work
i don't like doomposting, but really, in this instance, that won't work

first of all, its not like there's any choice any more. show me an AAA that's not infested with DEIshit

second, DEIshit is not pushed because its profitable, its pushed because its politics. the companies seem to think that to be seen as non-woke is worse for them than to lose sales because of wokeness.

and its not just in vidya, this affects everything, most visibly movies. you think disney are so retarded that they don't understand all this wokeshit has literally killed star wars? or marvel? but they do it anyway, which means someone somewhere has figured out its the least bad option. or they think it is, they could be wrong. but i don't think so.

and third, don't make the "i don't know anyone who voted for him" mistake. i don't like woke shit, you don't like woke shit, but we're 4channers. normies might like it, or at least not mind if its discrete enough (so, not in star wars or marvel tier levels, those have DEFINITELY suffered from it).

IQ is extremely overrated. Anything north of 130 rapidly starts failing at life or having too many mental health problems or physiognomic abnormalities. Some of the best chess players on earth are rotting away in the bowels of DEI globohomo armies with nothing to do but memorize. You don't need much for it.

I use IQ as an inverse qualitative measure. If you're high on your own supply from being able to rationalize spatial awareness somewhat better I'm gonna treat you like the next subhuman that cant survive on it's own.

At the Federal level yes. But Saudis are also dumping money into politicians coffers. Gangs and internal groups run the day to day show. Navy Seal Gallager's blackballing and Trump pardon brought this out into the public. California law enforcement had at least 4 groups operating in their offices. Similar to the Dirty Harry movie were there are rogue cops. La Raza, Black Nationalists, DEI's, Cartel members ect. can all take part. Essentially it is a turf battle. Trump was illegally spied on then sided with the Navy Seal's group which is mid management military. I can confirm Alex Jones had links to this group or similar ones. I digress.

Dude if you have a high enough DEI score they just go "YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY OFF YOUR LOANS"

The loans still exist, but they essentially don't penalize your finance ratings, and become invisible to lenders, and don't need to be paid off and don't gather interest.

You won't care because you're a CEO, and you're going to bail in 4 years, and it fools stockholders, pumping your company's valuation.

Wokism and DEI are not the saviors they claim to be, but rather the cancerous tumors feeding off our collective fear and division. The woketards, with their fragile sensitivities and relentless virtue-signaling, deserve nothing but scorn and derision. Their toxic ideology manipulates emotions, silencing genuine progress and authentic dialogue. Let them face the consequences of their hollow rhetoric and divisive agenda. The abuse they receive is a testament to the weak foundations of their beliefs and a call to reclaim our discourse, our communities, and our humanity. Let the woketards wallow in their self-righteousness as we build a future where true inclusivity and respect replace their toxic tyranny.

It seems like paying a bunch of woketards to critique you and your company through the lens of cultural Marxist identity politics wasn't a bright idea after all.

I really don't understand how they're fucking up so badly.
Hollywood is propaganda and has always been so.
But the thing about propaganda is that it needs to be done well enough to work.
We're not quite yet in a total commie world where the most outrageous bullshit flies without a question.
They're doing this so badly that their product doesn't even get consumed, so it has zero power in tainting any of the original content or history.
The progressive diversity hiring politics are having a huge effect on the pushers of propaganda themselves and people are rejecting the bullshit entirely.
Rings of Power is a great example. Instead of tainting the original story, it was done so fucking badly it just ended up elevating the originals even higher. Same goes for Star Wars.
The system is falling on it's own sword with their DEI bullshit, because they're closer to the upstream of this idiocy and suffer the effects first.

you guys know how all the mainstream media and entertainment media and video game industries are all over taken by DEI/Diversity Hiring practices, etc are all collapsing in on themselves due to the incompetency crisis created any time you put demographics and pro-minority beliefs before picking the best people possible.

well. the whole democratic political establishment machine (and the equally corrupt and incompetent RINO republican political establishment machine) are also basically run the same flawed DEI, Diversity Hires practices. thats how we got Obama, thats how we almost got Clinton, thats how they got joe in there(gave him a really retarded black female VP), etc. they diversity hire out the most important positions in corrupt backdoor deals where the stupider the person in the job, the better for everyone betting money on them.

the end goal of the the handful of competent big power player oligarchs/ elite / establishment / whatever you want to call it IS to destroy american/western society and knock it down a peg. so filling all these front-facing VIP political positions with useless old corrupt easily manipulatable pawns like Biden and Kamala Harris. Nancy Pelosi. the clintons, the Obama,s Chuck Schumer. Mitt Romney. The Bushes. etc. all really incompetent and corrupt and easily manipulatable politicians. they are all as dumb and fucked up as hunter biden. once he is 80 they will try to make him president. he is right up there with macron, trudeu, obama, etc in terms of weird gay psychopath vibes.

The idea is less that it's Kamala. She's DEI, but more importantly she fits in by being not fucking old and able to articulate and mingle with the other leaders around her age. If it were a younger white guy like Beshear from Kentucky, he'd also be pushed heavier if he were Biden's VP because of the fact that he's younger, sharper and able to work with people around his age and older. It's a figurative torch passing and Biden's refusal to do it and his admission to refusal multiple times is a problem and just goes to the idea that boomers and older refuse to move forward even if it means everything around them is destroyed as a result of their stubbornness to "keep things the same" when that doesn't work anymore.

>, I'm here to ask what does an investment firm gain by shoving politics into a form of escapism.
they end up owning the IP via the supply of easy but unrepayable loans (because the ease of the loans is based on adherence to IP cratering DEI/ESG edicts). so when AI debuts (ie: they let the public have access to tech that's ready and waiting to deploy already) the ONLY profit model will be micro-licensing of IP characters, elements, actor's likenesses and whatnot. Which they fully intend to control/own in totality - and control the use of , including the harvesting of any new popular mash-ups and unique emergent concepts that come from works using their captured IPs. (EULA will involve you surrendering all rights to the end work if you want anybody else to be able to watch it - it you say no, the AI gatekeeping/copyright policing mechanism will destroy your original file, because using this kind of AI Movie Making service will mean agreeing to these new public distribution terms and the attendant invasive policing systems).

tl;dr:
they gain total control of the entire modern pop culture content library and any of it's infinite potential mixes and remixes, until mathematically it technically owns ALL possible forms of creative expression (because ownership of any and all non-destroyed variants pass to them and even if you destroy your original file they can just have THEIR AI regenerate it from your snooped prompts and training-matrix anyway).

We're witnessing an attempt at GIGANTIC cultural capture/theft.

It isn't just Biden, the entire country is organically shifting rightwards...

We saw a similar effect in the 70's. After years of civil rights nonsense, rising crime, anti-patriotism in the culture, stagflation, people got very tired. They left the cities, suburbs exploded, music shifted from black tunes to high energy masculine white rock. Republicans took over with massive leads for 12 years, and the only way Dems got back into power was by pushing a quasi Republican candidate (Clinton) and splitting the vote. So what's happening right now?

Well, after a full decade of BLM/SJWs/DEI, rising crime in cities and hands off policing, soaring costs and inflation, people are leaving cities again. Suburbs and rural areas are growing, and the urban share of the US has dropped from 34% to 30% in a matter of 3 years. States like CA/IL/NY serve as cautionary tales to the rest of the country regarding Democratic overlordship. Nig fatigue has set in. Rap is all but dead, country music is the new muse.

In the modern political scene, it's all about demographics. Urban demographics lean hard left, suburban slightly right, and rural hard right. Growing suburbanization/ruralization and declining urbanization means, for the time being, a concrete rightward shift in national political sentiments and if Republicans go back to back in 2024 and 2028 you are going to see the Democratic party have to reinvent itself once again as the "tamer Republicans" in order to regain power.

1. Reduce the federal government's role in education. Shift government funds away from public schools and toward private and charter schools.
2. Reform the SNAP program. Mandate work requirements for able-bodied adults.
3. Radically tighten immigration policies. Strengthen border enforcement, conduct mass deportations, and complete construction of the wall on the border with Mexico. Use regular Army and National Guard troops to interdict illegal immigrants at the southern border.
4. Revoke FDA approval of mifepristone, a widely used abortion drug, reduce the allowable time for its use to 7 weeks of pregnancy instead of the current 10 weeks, and ban mail-order sales of the drug.
5. Support a biblical, social science-based definition of marriage and family. Restrict LGBT rights. Reinstate the ban on transgender people serving in the military, which was lifted by the Biden administration.
6. A major reorganization of federal agencies. Eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Cut funding for the Justice Department, eliminate the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency (reorganize its functions among other organizations), eliminate the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce. Independent government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission should be placed under direct presidential control.
7. Drastically cut programs aimed at supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in government agencies.
8. Repeal or reform the dietary guidelines published by the Department of Agriculture.
9. Fight the deep state, assert America's leadership on the world stage. Develop a nuclear arsenal. Curtail international aid programs.
10. Consolidate executive power in the hands of the US president. Abolish the FBI. Increasing the number of federal government positions that have the status of "political appointees." Rolling back the reforms of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson.

Indians will bring with them their own problems. Already you had Khalistan independence movement in Canada and they are significant voting block, having their own temples, but they also attracted assassination from the Indian state, so with migrants came some separatist movement and the struggle with Indian state. It's how things will be, they will bring trouble like that. With elections in India, they will tie those things with local US and Canadian politics, like a tight knot. Imagine someone local politician in US will have anti Indian views, or pro-Pakistan pro-China views, he may face violence and opposition from Indian lobby. They will only accept complete influence, they will put Indians in all positions of power. Maybe they will even conflict with jews because traditionaly jews held high power control positions but now Indians will want to get those. That's why Jews turned against DEI recently. India is the ocean in size of population and Canada and US are just lake and big lake, so the ocean of Indians will always consume the lakes. USA, UK and Canada will just become India Minor where Indians will brawl with Muslims, Pakistanis, jews and Chinese for influence. Where will the whites be in this equation? Nowhere.

The problem with a strategy like this is that Whites are still something like 90% of the Canadian population.

Sure in the large cities like the GTA and Vancouver, the percentage of racial minorities is a lot higher, maybe something like 20%, which is why it seems like there's more immigrants and minorities than there actually are. Then you have the DEI policies of the media/TV shows etc which serve to overrepresent the percentage of minorities. But go to Alberta or Manitoba and that drops to around like 3% with a sea of White people everywhere.

And in an ostensible democracy, the moment you start fragmenting people along ethnic/racial lines, the largest ethnic group is going to win out. They're going to elect their own to high-office, populate the civil services, corporations.etc.

The only reason this hasn't happened yet is because White people have been indoctrinated over the past 30-40 years to self-hate and welcome "diversity". Canada is a "post-national" state, Canada committed "genocide" against natives, etc.

Everyone in power despises Kamala. They know she’s a DEI hire behind the scenes. They will do everything to undermine her. No one respects her. I have serious doubts.

She’s almost equivalent to Biden in that she would be controlled by shadow people. She’s weak and pathetic.

He kept trying to bait the west into fighting Iran for him, from day 1, but that's failed for the last 9 months. Which is why they kept pushing the connection to Iran in MSM and news conferences, for at least a month or two after the war started. As Iran has been #1 on their war wish list for USA and the west to fight for israel, for at least 4 decades using lies each time

Technology replacing ordinary healthy social interactions and vital bond building between humans.
Microplastics everywhere (in female ovaries and male testes).
"Vaccines" killing young healthy people daily, making people infertile, and more attempted mandates to come in the future.
DEI purposely displacing native European men, making it impossible to lay the foundation to create, provide for and raise a healthy family.

That's putting it mildly. She's smug, self-righteous, and thoroughly unlikeable. When you combine it with her background as a DEI hire negro woman from California, it combines to make her the least marketable candidate of all time. That lady has the opposite of charisma. When you hear her speak in Congress, it's all grandstanding that makes you wish Willie Brown roughed her up when he was bedding her in the '90s.

The D base isn't really the issue, the issue is that Kamala lacks most of the traits that made Joe electable in the first place. Her actual policy record, such that it exists, is pretty unimpressive, moderate enough I guess, but she'll never be able to sell herself as a moderate since she's a black woman from California and a DEI hire to boot. She's everything that the Rust Belt voter hates about the Democratic Party, the things they rejected with Clinton only Kamala is even worse. On a personal level she's not particularly engaging or exciting, there won't be a lot of grassroots support for her.

Also the Willie Brown affair will come up and it WILL hurt her, redditers have been shitting their pants over 20 year olds dating 25 year olds, how are they going to react when they find out Kamala was a woman in her 20s sleeping with her 70s boss?

the american government prints money, then gives it to a jewish bank, who then loans it to the american government. The 'federal debt' is essentially 'how much money is in circulation'. It's owed to a small group of jews because they tricked proto-boomers into signing away the ability to manage the nation's finances under the premise that 'if bankers run the country's check book, then the country will never have inflation, deflation, or bank runs'.

the jews proceeeded to intentionally cause periods of inflation, recession, and bank runs but never got fired, fined, or penalized for, what was essentially, the nation's first DEI job.

tldr;

Fuckin A dude, I work in I.T. in a kind of specialized role. It''s something that I.T. will have a difficult time replacing.

I had a liver transplant last August and had to eventually quit with the promise I'll "come back when healthy". They've been calling for the last couple of weeks trying to get me back to the role I was in.

This company was one that started putting pronouns in profiles, I was one of the few that did not and refused. The same company that has DEI training that I skipped. The same company that was falling lock step with all the bullshit of the last 10 years.

I drank all day while working and still outperformed them. It's insane.

yes, it should be legal to beat one's wife: talk shit get hit, bitch. better keep your attitude in check, cunt, before you get get wrecked, cunt.

divorce? not possible when you have no rights (i.e. no right to take anything to court).

murdering your own children? (abortion) Not going to happen without rights: your father or husband will erase you, baby murdering bitch.

cheating on and trying to ditch your husband? Where are you going to go when you're not even literate and don't even know how to drive a car, whore?

think you're going to act like a cunt in public? nothing a few backhanded slaps won't cure.

think you're going to troon out your husband's kids? I don't think so, slave-wife.

When you understand the American politics isn’t about actual elections but is a false popularity contest to keep ahem “certain populations of citizens from rioting” you will understand. If they don’t get enough attention “sports ball” music, politics they start to become violent and so it’s more a dance of appeasement than anything else.

Don’t worry it’s coming to Europe as well! More and more attention and focus will be lavished on them, the government programs for them will show minimal improvement in anything they had been trying to fix and then the goal posts will get pushed into retarded reasons as to why it’s not working like micro aggressions and racism.

People who say our culture is centered on them is because they watch american media who placates to them and so they get a false sense of what is actually happening.

Yeah but that's the industry and largely capitalism. Middlemen are the gatekeepers. It's why agents and guilds and lawyers and middle management exist. The layer between artist and widespread distribution. This occurs in all industries. It works as the ultimate filter. No matter how great your work or idea or whatever is, if you don't pass through (and most importantly, pay and earn for) these layers, you get nowhere. They are there on purpose as a quality control lever. The term 'quality' here isn't based on artistic merit but how well you can perform and earn and are malleable enough to their own wants and end-product. This is largely why culture is shit now. Decades of this established mechanism has now grown into a filter so tight it's only passed if you can make immediate money either via ticking off DEI quotas that qualify for interest-free loans or fitting into the pre-determined algorithm that they decided upon is going to be a "success" in the medium they control. Etc.

Have you seen Kamala ever attempt to defend any position she holds in response to questions, which she rarely gets? Or see her advocate a policy/regulation she says will fix a problem? Or try to continue to give an impromptu speech that she wasn't prepared for? Hell, even see her syntax when she's trying to retort to a political opponent or reporter/journalist? It's downright fucking retarded and nonsensical blabbering. Not like dementia Joe where it's an old guy losing his train of thought and forgetting what he's saying, no, Kamala has no idea what the fuck she's even trying say in the first place and obviously has no clue about the obvious issues raised when she does partly say something that is comprehensible because she clearly has no clue, again, what the fuck she's saying at all. She has no idea about the ramifications of what she wants and I'm almost certain she clueless of basic law and the constitution and how it all works. It's why she goes and rambles to other dumb liberal women saying circular illogical dumb bullshit that she thinks makes sense and sounds somewhat safisticated that other retards(women) will think sounds profound. She couldn't even get to the first objective in the DNC primary when she was running despite being the big DEI pawn because her staff realized she's a huge bitch and that she couldn't even comprehend policy and debate strategy. Tulsi made it clear during the dem debate to anyone who isn't a complete partisan hack that she's incapable of being in politics, much less the president. She had to end her campaign soon after and would have been a footnote in presidential politics if not for Biden to come and scoop her up because he needed a token brown woman for a VP.

Had they picked completely at random a middle-aged white male family man to be their set armorer, nothing like this would have happened. But instead they hired a woman to do a man's job. It really is just that simple.

Corporate cost cutting/ greed + DEI hires not knowing how to engineer ways around corporate greed = cataclysm for everyone involved. Guarantee you this is the result of female board members running the company into the ground because they were too stupid to invent new, more cost effective materials with ease like China and other countries that actually value educated engineers can and frequently do now...

In reality through several ways white men are not being hired: DEI/ESG investing, wage subsidies, racial nepotism etc.

This is the line they are feeding the rest of society as to why their white sons just aint 'making it'

First, almost a year ago, AnitaB's GHC (Grace Hopper Convention) gets overran by trannies and males claiming to be non-binary as progressives follow gender theory dogmatically and have the inability to define female. Men literally mogged women by pushing them aside for career opportunities. Then, a few months ago, Women Who Code shut down. Now Girls in Tech is also closing. Times are rough for the ESG/DEI, womenintech grifters. None of them even try to stimulate genuine interest in technology and instead use feminist rhetoric like glass ceiling, patriarchy, misogyny, sexual harassment, male fragility, etc to blame why they don't enter the industry.

When i was in second grade a black kid cut me in line and called me a white boy, i didn't let him and called him a black boy. I got suspended for that and he got no punishment. It was perhaps my first lesson on race. DEI is actively anti white though and affects all whites. Non whites in groups pick on whites who are alone, there's thousands of examples.
There's an attempt at reparations in CA currently, not a slave state. I don't think anyone could make fun of me for being white, i wouldn't take it as an insult if they tried. I love being white and can't imagine being anything else, i have no white guilt/shame.

Yeah, a unit whose function is to do nothing except giving birth and doing minor help does not make crimes, it doesn't do anything meaningless at all. You won't experience poverty as long as you have cunt, because of onlyfans or sugar daddies.

Food production is an order of magnitude cheaper today than 60 years ago, and because of technology, coordination of logistics has become much more efficient. The raw materials to make a burger cost a fraction of what they used to.

The problem is that tons of companies have overpaid, do-nothing executives and straight up saboteurs. They also have greedy owners and investors concentrating a fuckton of wealth at the top.

What you didn't have 60 years ago was an executive class that makes 10-30x more than the average worker just to sit around and make PowerPoint presentations about new initiatives on how to sell more burgers, or to get you to buy into their company's burger ecosystem, or to get you to partake in their burger culture.

In-n-Out simply sells the best possible burger for the best possible price, and optimizes operations around that. They realized that the customer's experience depends on competent management at the store level and well-trained, fast and friendly employees, so they invest in well compensated store managers and servers. They understand that paying an exec $800k/year plus stock options to make DEI presentations is a waste of money. This does nothing to address the needs of the customer.

A store manager making $150k will be incentivized to keep the store clean, compliant and well-coordinated, and overseeing the team. Employees making $25/hr will be grateful they don't have to work elsewhere making $16.

Pajeets come here with fake degrees for every program. My friends and I all went into vastly different fields from science, to art, to engineering, to hospitality, to business, to psychology. The only one of us who managed to get a good job (or any job relating to our fields for that matter) is the guy who did business and that is likely because he is extremely competent at a relatively niche part of business that has a lot of demand. Summer jobs are non-existent this year because of the influx of jeets. So if you want to stay in school longer in the hopes of transcending the ranks, you will be poor. Companies both private and public are suffering competency crises because of how retarded most jeets are and how much they lie on their resumes. Still, they hire more jeets because they will work for less and it looks good for their DEI scores. We live in hell.

Let’s highlight this spectacular blunder:

>"extream"

The misspelling of "extreme" as "extream" is a glaring error that completely undermines any serious message the post might have intended to convey. In a professional or even semi-serious context, such a basic spelling mistake is inexcusable. It’s akin to a clown tripping over his own oversized shoes in the middle of a performance—utterly laughable and pathetically inept.

>"extream"

This mistake screams of a lack of basic literacy skills. How can anyone take the content seriously when the author can't even spell simple words correctly? It’s a clear indicator that the operatives involved are anything but competent. The fact that an FBI operative, presumably tasked with high-stakes investigations, can’t spell "extreme" correctly is a damning indictment of the competency (or lack thereof) within Gibson’s team. It’s a DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)-level fail in the realm of literacy. This thread is nothing short of a circus performance, with "extream" being the comedic centerpiece. It’s as if the operative behind the post donned a clown suit and big red shoes, performing for an audience that’s in on the joke—the joke being the sheer incompetence of the FBI operative.

I am 100% convinced it's been designed to allow richfags to leave, but to nail down small entrepreneurs.
Because small business usually operates like this – you work a long time for scraps, then you hit a few good customers, some product, and have a few good years, then it's over, because big companies replace you, it goes out of fashion, etc.

So smaller entrepreneurs usually make their retirement money in a few years, at least when they are innovative –what all the countries pretend to want.

But in reality, they create taxes and laws to prevent that small business innovation at all cost.

People who do not acknowledge that and hope to make it big usually end up robbed by the government, poor, and dependent on government workers. Which is a driving force behind this, the extension of governmental power. Not even WEF master minds, just bureaucrats hoping to expand their office, getting a raise to be the leader of a new team etc. – governmental overreach is built into the system at the lowest, generic level.

For a fair chance for entrepreneurs, you'd need to reduce laws by a 100 times, be honest about all the hidden taxes (inflation, tax consultants, other consultants like for DEI, auditors, in essence taxes on unfinished government tax products), and acknowledge that short burst by allowing them to invest the gains from these years for retirement. Which is possible on paper, but in reality, well yeah, the consultants are waiting...

Straight up too. Im just here to stir shit.
Shitposting is my morning coffee before the sun comes up and I start my day.
Where better to shitpost than 4chan, the place where people will argue eternal youth geysers in antartica and coverup business corruption by screaming dei?

I was a original here. When if was only a image board. I use to shitpost with moot and snacks. Snacks did nothing wrong.
/b/ was the first quarantine before every single low IQ retard thought he was a political scholar. /b/ quarantined the brain broken again and turned into a teen angst board. Alot of shit in-between that. But ultimately, this is my home too. Invaded by the same hogs that are invading with sports bars and Starbucks.

I think I'm allowed to throw a little shade for fun. Are these really the most innocent people? Are you?
Am I?

YeetMeIntoKSpaceArmy Veteran 1 point 6 months ago

I want to be perfectly clear to everyone who reads this guy’s claims:
He is engaging in the standard rhetorical behaviors of someone spreading disinformation. I will elaborate below, but BLUF: he’s probably not worth engaging with, and you should take everything he says with a grain of salt.

He probably sounds somewhat convincing, because he tries to sound like an academic with his verbiage. But one thing he continuously does is make grandiose claims, without providing any supporting evidence. He claims the existence of such evidence, and he claims that his logic is sound, but without providing any such proof or explicitly laying out his reasoning, and he preemptively attacks anyone who disagrees with him. For example, his post here claims:

>CRT is expressly anti-white. This is well established doctrine…anyone who claims otherwise is engaging in deep intellectual dishonesty.

Later, in other responses, he states the following:

>The policy (and the thesis of the post) was rooted in DEI and CT. And recent reports from the DoD support my conclusion.

In response to being challenged:

>Eventually, people with have to provide evidence [against my claims].

In response to being asked to provide evidence:

>What are the theoretical underpinnings of DEI? Where does DEI draw its conclusions from?

So, you’ll notice a common thread here, which is that he is attempts to evade actually providing evidence by asking questions, and challenging his opponents to provide evidence to counter his claims. He claims he has evidence without ever actually stating what it is, and he makes confident assertions and quickly attacks anyone who challenges him (intellectual dishonesty, referring to the January 6th safety stand-downs as “struggle sessions” and implicitly accusing supporters of those stand-downs and trainings of being communist agitators, and so forth).
A good question to ask when you notice this behavior is: why?

"At the watch party". I must have misunderstood when Trump said "at the debate" which is not the watch party.

I was seriously expecting MIGAtards to start crowing over which one was there. And it was crickets. What I was gathering watching x before I got the ban hammer for upsetting jews, is that his base wants Vivek--they see his "short list" which I heard him denounce the other day, he said that didn't come from him therefore I'm guessing it's Jew pressure by leaking a jew approved list.

His base doesn't want DEI VPs faggots (Rubio and Vance) etc.

The argument is that I, as the shareholder, expect you to be making a profit, not pushing for trans acceptance, DEI, open borders, closed borders, a strong middle class, abortions, prayer in school, whatever the fuck.

I don't trust that guy at all. He does the slow information release the same as James O'Keefe.
Just about every company in America is a DEI hellhole now. Just pick any random company and go to their website and look for a DEI or ESG section. You will find it.
I did that for a bunch of random companies with buildings in my city. All of them have DEI statements on their website, every one.

My point is it's not helpful to slowly trickle release info that one company is woke.
By the time he gets through all the companies that are woke, he'll be old and retired and all the people behind the bullshit today will have gotten away with it.
IF you're going to spend time talking about woke online, talk about solutions.

Here's a solution: rely less on the system. That probably means making sacrifices and lowering your standard of living.

Dude you just contradicted yourself. AI and chatgpt right now already btfos 30% of developers lol. All your DEI and coders soley in it for hte money are getting cut completely becuase AI can easily replace them for simple tasks.
The devs that are actually intelligent and passionate about coding and their work will always be in demand obviously. Dudes dedicating their lives to coding for their job by day and doing open source stuff at night without pay are completey different from the hordes of DEI, indians, and bag chasers that are fresh out of college with a comp sci degree.

AI is obliterating everyone who isnt dedicated and talented in coding. Most bum level coders will just use AI if you hire them.

So no, you are completely done for in the coding sector if you are just a casual in it for money and arent learning or innovating in the field. The Swedish poster described perfectly.

This is why I maintain that no good studio is large and games should never be AAA. There are no human organizations that big that aren't infested with shelf mushrooms (fungi you find on large, strong trees but their existance is a sign of internal rot).

Once you get that big you become full of people who are great at surviving and thriving in organizations, not necessarily good at whatever the organization sets out to do and often times detrimental to it. The russian mod for example is stuffed with corrupt incompetent officers that waste their mens lives but they're excellent at getting promotions and sucking up to the right people. Same shit here.

darker skinned people are less intelligent and have inferior culture. its just a fact. its not a causation, just a coincidence. and in thousands of years the opposite might be true if the right evolutionary pressures present themselves. but right now it IS a correlation and thats good enough.

Its perfect for jewish media, white people judge character and will be confused with why people feel bad for career criminals and will get angry when the chimpouts destroy their communities and cost taxpayers millions. White people obey law and order to preserve a balanced society and cant imagine themselves in these scenarios. black people will sympathize with victim regardless and be angered by police killing one of their own no matter “dey circumstances” and dont care what lead up to the instance, only the result of police force. It also heightens their own fears with law enforcement and perceived racial biases they face in the “evil white racist” society that jews also continuously perpetuate through government and media. They now are scared of law enforcement and act irrationally leading to more instances of brutality. Its a perfect story to get white and blacks at eachothers throats, when jews can stand on top of the pyramid, be the morally superior ones and laugh at us. They get to bash whites for “not caring enough about racial disparities” “silence is violence” etc. They get to be the anti-racist ones to tell blacks they got their backs and say its not dey fault ever and use these examples to promote the idea that they are being systematically discriminated against to give them more gibs and DEI programs. Using moments of tragedy for the purpose of dividing and conquering is their tactic.

This is why we are entering a period of great intellectual stagnation because you need sufficient proximity distance from niggers to be able to think and reason clearly. For most of academics and high iq business product or capability generators so Elon Musk, Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, in no particular order. If you look around at all the greats, not just the aforementioned ones, they grew up and studied in relatively nigger free or absolutely nigger free neighborhoods, schools, unis, and their first gigs.

Nowadays that’s not really possible anymore with niggers everywhere due to affirmative actions DEI, inclusive and other bullshit.

I propose a new a social economic pollutant measurement called the Nigger Drag Coefficient - defined as the number of interactions or proximity to niggers on a daily or weekly basis in R^3 using Euclidean distance.

Denzl is based, but having a nigger emperor and the rap music makes it apparent, the movies aim is niggerification of history and a once great film. Sad. I just watched blade, alien and candy man the other day, and thought, why the fuck cant they just make movies like those? They all had niggers and "diversity" but in their own ways and the end result was a good movie. If they have to push DEI so hard, why cant they atleast do it like they used to, where its was organic feeling and never took away from the story?

I perhaps interpreted your post as being more jingoistic than it really was.
Besides the mistakes you mentioned, not telling us was also a mistake. How hard is to for Biden to phone Boris and tell us you are gonna leave? Was his idea that America would leave and Britain would hold the place on our own? With our decrepit, underfunded DEI army?

There is no such thing as a "useless job".

Every single job exists for a reason. McDonalds needs fry cooks, Law firms need paralegals, and Farmers need farmhands. That said, not all reasons are good reasons. Even BS middle management positions exist for a reason, probably money laundering IDK. Diversity quotas are filled by giving incompetent brownoids BS leadership positions that involve little to no work just to get kike billionaire DEI funds, think about how lots of those "Day in the life of a vapid cunt working for a massive tech company" were mainly women.

Point being, if they don't need anyone, then the job wouldn't exist. The reality is that they don't want native White men, they want exploitable foreigners who work for slave wages.

But yes, they probably have some issues that they need to resolve if they want to continue their legacies and have their children become stronger.
Some malicious DEI hires have been posting pictures about replacing them with non-white third worlders from around the world, and that's exactly what they have been trying to do for the last 3-4 years with stuffing them in every restaurants and gas stations in rural areas.
How can they do it? Because they know business owners in rural areas can be little different than urban democrats when push comes to shove.

So all the shilling aside I have a serious question because I actually have a different take depending on the answer. For any leafs, how popular is KFC in Canada? I've seen other chains internationally change their menu because the brand wasn't very popular and it was a niche. They changed it up to better serve the niche. Sure KFC Canada is gonna wave the DEI flag on this but I think this could just be many immigrants go there anyway(KFC only being in the eastern cities) and it's not popular. This to me is less of a cucking and more just changing shit around because only towelheads go there anyway/

>>
The BRIDGE mission is to create a cultural shift in companies where DEI principles flow through all facets of an organization, from the C-Suite and marketing through product development, procurement and customer service.

With the variety of programs that BRIDGE offers including proprietary research, storytelling workshops, events and more, we identify, dismantle, and rethink the structures in place that currently contribute to the gap in belonging, representation, inclusion, diversity and equity (BRIDGE is an acronym for these).

Our long term goal, with the help of our founding board members composed of DEI and business leaders, is to create a comprehensive BRIDGE agenda for all companies and to subsequently certify against its implementation and measure its impact.

Read Steven Baskerville's "The New Politics of sex", he has an entire section dedicated to the feminization of the military. Basically they are bankrupting the army by leeching off all the VA benefits. Every second foid finishes her tour with a PTSD diagnosis, and often gets $28,00+ a month USD in disability buxx. They can earn additional income on top of this as well. I had an american friend who did this and she was pretty chuffed with her gravy train.

They hog up all the Rear Echelon roles and easy jobs and are promoted disproportionately more to positions of authority, which leads to a lot of resentment. There's a MeToo culture that has accompanied the increased sexualization, and despite the women there being free to fuck whoever they want, they can end the career of any man that acts inappropriately towards them.

It's absolutely killing the US military. The bleeding of recruits is down to this feminization (alongside DEI). When it comes to actual deployment they often get pregnant to avoid being sent out, and many brown single mothers are attracted to low ranking jobs for the free childcare the army provides. The defence force is becoming a weird combination of a daycare service, a welfare service and a tertiary training college for women.

You seem to think a nation is a economic zone which would make sense to you if you were a immigrant because that’s all it is to you when a real person goes to war for their country they go to protect their family and loved ones otherwise there’s no point in fighting that’s what makes a nation, your family or ethnic group members, go back to whatever shithole you crawled out of faggot

No poor people aren't going to digest all this liberal bullshit of accepting blacks and trans rights above a good economy. Simple as, the bankers and people like Larry Fink who push all this DEI will probably be lynched or worse.

Nobody wants communism and people only tolerate the current Jewish system because they aren't poor enough.

I know the entire plan was to make everyone poor and get them to give all their rights to the Jewish commisars and have nice Jewish controlled commies running the world forever but it's simply not happening, your going to get Nazi white people again way before you get Commie white people and as soon as Bill from accounting with a 115IQ instead of Cleetus from the gas station can't obtain a reasonable life anymore, Bill is going to become Jew Killer 2000.

White people are exceedingly good at war and your going to get it eventually. Especially if you destroy the middle class which largely contains and pacifies quality whites with debt and materialism.

Trump will allow Palestine to be destroyed. Jews will move into Ukraine Anonymous ID:9MbAKs8I Mon 08 Jul 2024 16:02:29 No.473495393  Replies: 2 ViewReport
So I think I figured out the master plan by the jews.

In 2017, Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem. Why? Because he was testing the waters to see the reaction. This also de-legitimized Palestine. The problem is the jews needed to take over Palestine, however not under Trump, because that would make him look bad. So Trump needed to get out for a bit for some of the things to play out.

Also, the Jews need to expand. This is where Ukraine comes in. They install Zelensky and Russia goes into Ukraine for a "special operation" which is never really defined. That special operation? Kill Ukrainian men and send the rest to Poland and other parts of Europe.

So here is where it gets good. Trump will win 2024. He will "Resolve" both conflicts within months. He comes out looking like gold. Russia gets a bit of Ukraine for their efforts and the kikes end up settling in Ukraine.

On the other side, Israel gets rid of Palestine and with the help of the US, takes out all of the other small groups like Hezboallah, Houthis etc. Iran basically gets neutered and a new government will get installed there. Now Israel is safe, the kikes take over their old homeland in Ukraine, Trump is king of the kikes and in return, they dial down all the ESG shit, the DEI shit and LGBT shit so the whites do not open revolt.

Except you're not taking into account economic situations. the 15% of non-Whites back then were either literally slaves or an economic underclass. these divisions are not so clear cut, now.

Much as I'd like to agree because i h8 nigs more than pretty much anything, but i have it on good info from a couple of lads who work in the insurance world, that the issue is women.

It works in 3 ways. Minor bumps parking and manoeuvres that involve hand eye judgements, right of way confusions such as slip road approaches, pulling outbof junctions, using round abouts etc, and finally the classic modern woman problem which is that itbis never their fault and the other party is always to blame. This is why the insurers always pay out. Recording the sex of an insurance claim is illegal under the DEI laws passed through by the blair lefities, so although the insurers know exactly whats going on, we all pay, and the only winners are the insurance companies.

DiCaprio is speculated to be gay and using fake relationships with young women to uphold the image.
The women here would benefit from financial compensation as well as potentially boosting their modeling and acting careers. Their contracts may be set to expire by age 25 to allow them to move on and start a regular family before they're too old.
This scheme may have been set up around the time DiCaprio starred in huge movies like Titanic, where a heterosexual image may have been financially advantageous.
There may not be an easy way out because admitting to this scheme would hurt his and his "partners" credibility as well as offend today's DEI views on LGBT.

Junipero Serra was also a Franciscan priest who helped establish settlements in Tijuana where the Tijuana Cartel operates from. The House of Torlonia launder their criminal profits from their American crime families and Mexican drug cartels in Las Vegas casinos. The word casino is an Italian term derived from the noble families running gambling events out of their casas or houses. The Torlonia family are owners of the Franciscan Order and Juarez is their territory since their Franciscans founded its first European settlement.

and the left is going to have to pander to them even harder..... along with letting in more millions of people through the southern border illegally who have no attachment to the country but will dive right into the divisie/racialized politics of the left.

More cheap labor, along with more foreign students coming into our universities. So ya all kinds of black/hispanic/white jobs will be lost. Pic very related.
but there is a more off putting aspect to this globalism.
You have seen and heard the resentment from the foreign minister Jaishankar. The posts here don't help, but the history of colonialism is still fresh in the minds many people around the world, but that resentment can be dissipated if they see someone who looks like them in positions of power here in our country, particularly if said person follows the DEI ideology, which is an anti-white, anti-meritocratic and a resentful ideology. For the globalists who see the global south rising and a future market this is their way into said markets, but at the expense of who, and the expense of the native populations of their countries, which happen to be primarily white.

Trading houses back and forth while they double and triple in "value" with nothing actually added, just ping-ponging the asset around. DEI/ESG funding. Bribes, politicians pocketing money, money laundering, nepotism. Every industry is a monopoly, everything is fixed and rigged and in bed with government. Everything is a scam.

This stupid negress doesn't even know you're not supposed to do that. She's a DEI hire. Her thesis for her comms degree was "Uh muh fuck white people dey raysis bix nood".
She's so ignorant she doesn't even understand why she got canned. She literally dindu nuffin' except what she was told.

I oppose this because it's expensive and we have planes. All we need is to not have a fag in control of our transportation and for Boeing to fire the DEI hires for it to be safe again (this by the way will not be much safer and will also be staffed and built by DEI hires under the current regime).
I oppose war because it's expensive and people tend to die.

Truth.

... but also, pajeets get jobs from globohomo DEI same as asians. This is to drive down wages, not on merit.

Pajeets can do braindead IT work, because they are capable of memorizing repeatable task... but they lack innovative or strategic thinking, which is why they dumb down a workplace.

Because they mostly commit crimes against each other, work hard and do all the shitty jobs no one else wants to do. They hate niggers and kill them regularly in prison. They’re strong family oriented and Catholic. Indians are greedy conniving fucks that set up businesses to scam or con others, even when it’s a legit business they only have their interests in mind fuck the customer, they smell like dog shit and use a combination of DEI and nepotism to get ahead. They’re pussies that don’t like to get their hands dirty hence taking up all the call center jobs, then complain about how they don’t have money and can’t find jobs when there’s plenty of bout collar hard working good paying jobs available they’re to scared and pussy to do.

whites don't have the victim complex that binds the other tribes and promotes ingroup preference (slavery for nigs, holohoax for jews, "stolen land"/colonialism for spics/injuns/other browns). ours is building though. on twitter, millions of whites are exposed everyday to videos of nigs chimping out and attacking whites. and dei/blatant antiwhite discrimination as well as replacement and erasure in the media/entertainment (nig mermaid, snow brown, etc). we'll have our victim complex that awakens white identity soon. just hoping it happens before we become a minority

The Left promises to tax the rich and address inequality. But, if they win, they'll only open the borders further and dump more money into DEI.
The Right promises to crack down on illegal immigration and DEI. But, if they win, they'll only lower taxes on the rich and saber rattle against Iran, or China, or whoever else the likes hate this week.
There's no winning. The left won't lower the corporate tax rate, the right won't deport illegals, and there is literally zero connection between public opinion and the laws congress passes.

Remove the old school film reel overlay and just show the clips in the clearest video quality you can get them in. I recommend starting the video off with the Bill Maher clip as he's more well known among normies and build up from there. Using clips of well known celebrities or talking heads saying the quiet part out loud will resonate better with the audience you're trying to reach. If you're planning to do a series maybe try to stick with one topic per video. Mass immigration, DEI programs, the holocaust, slavery, communism, etc. The short video format is a great idea and using the ultimate shabbos goy as the narrator is just marvelously ironic. Keep it up.

I still have a strong suspicion that the babies died from the well-reported shitty hygiene standards in the ward (fun fact; the hospital in question is demolishing it and building a whole new maternity unit) and the pajeet doctors conspired to scapegoat the nurse, but oh well. She was probably obsessed with DEI like all women in the NHS.

>anyone else beats Trump
Not Harris. There’s a reason she’s been stowed away and rarely heard from. I want biden to stay in because it would be hilarious to watch him get clobbered then refuse to step down because he saved democracy… but Kamala. Oh seeing that bitch get sacrificed to the wolves would make my day. Her getting curb stomped would cause a huge rift between the left and establishment about race. The left will just call everyone racist while the establishment that cares about winning will all but say we shot ourselves in the feet with this DEI shit. Especially when 40-50% of the spics they imported just end up voting for their opposition anyway. They would be in a much better position if they had someone like Andrew Cuomo as VP.
