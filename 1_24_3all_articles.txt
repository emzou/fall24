Self check and correction

The "redpilled manosphere" is starting to become the same garbage tier as the their counter (the feminist lgbt dei crowd).
Why?
The "based and redpilled"
Movement didn't start with them
They don't own it
WE DO
Who is we? The people actually thinking
Mainly, anons on the net, it actually started
Here, on 4chan, specifically /b/
These people are unknowingly being infiltrated
Or they know and what the benefits of the old order

See, conservatives actually think that the "good coming out" right now is because of their "based" traditional values. So they're all starting to infect these money/fame hungry people with the conservative mind virus (liberal mind virus = LGBT DEI feminism)..... Yes, that's right, there's one to control the right wingers too.

That's religion.
These faggot's are slowly becoming biblianigger kike proxy religion spreaders. Others are siding with sandniggers and islam and NEITHER of them truly attack kikes for betraying humanity so they can live lavishly and run the human/child trafficking networks. Islam claims to hate likes but fails miserably at understanding that islam is just an offshoot, branch religion of judaism just like Christianity.

We haven't even gotten to the whole "earth is a human farm and the old Hebrews were the chosen.... as in chosen by aliens to help them farm us" topic.

Which is of course the main topic they want to avoid.
And thus the main topic I, and all true based and redpilled anons should talk about the most.

Conservatives have hilariously been using the whole "can't keep the truth from being known" thing.... Good, as was planned, now they will have to face their own truths that they've been hiding or were too scared to address.
Now they'll have to bend the knee, I honestly hope we get some mass suicides, mainly from kikes, some muslims and only the most ardent deranged christians as Christianity is the best of these 3 SOLELY because of Jesus, fuck the bible.
Game over.

Does the "We comin fo reparashuns in blood" faggots not pay attention to shit like this? It seems niggers are docile and have no adaptability whatsoever from living life on easy mode. Yes they can break shit but I doubt the majority could make simple rational decisions to stay alive if it requires any mechanical or electrical knowledge. I worked at a cable company as a contractor for about 12 months in a very diverse area, I joked that I was on of only 2 non management whites at the shop. We used metrics to rate our performance, calls taken, number of reservice within 30 days, cx satisfaction, etc. I was lead tech in nearly all metrics the 2 months before I left. I once attributed it to exceptionalism as I was junior to nearly everyone there. More and more I realize I was just briefly king of the retards and I thought relatively highly of some my coworkers as despite their failings they held down a job for years working 6 days a week. Either way if society breaks I think we are going to be alright bros. It will be hell on earth but in the survival of the fittest, your opponents will be fucked in a world deprived of DEI, police protection and whites on call to fix your fire alarm.

you can already see a contingent of the jews trying to do a 180 on DEI and other initiatives. they are attempting to make "anti woke" pro jew and pro isreal. its been very clunky and they will fail but we have to watch out for this tactic. the narrative dichotomy the jews are constructing is that you cannot have pro white politics without supporting pro zionist politics. don't let them create this false dichotomy. keep anti woke anti semetic.

This theatrical charade on Fox News, featuring an "English psychic" dishing out vague predictions with tarot cards, is not just a mockery of divination but a testament to how fearfully the establishment clings to pseudoscientific sensationalism. It's as if the powers-that-be are so terrified of facing real issues and real mystics that they resort to peddling nonsense under the guise of mysticism.

One can't help but wonder: Is Jesse Waters, a host on a "major news network," controlled in what he can or can't say? The narrative spun by this psychic conveniently aligns with prevailing sentiments, almost as if it's orchestrated to fit a certain agenda. The manipulation of symbols like the Death card, originally rich with meaning, has been reduced to a tool for political theatrics.

The establishment's willingness to entertain such ludicrous displays raises questions about the sincerity of their commitment to genuine discourse. Sure, you can continue pretending that rabbit ears are the pinnacle of technological sophistication, but the reality is that your viewership is aging faster than a cassette tape left out in the sun. So, enjoy your stint as the last bastion of televised mediocrity while the rest of us revel in the wonders of the digital age. Adieu, Jesse, the boomer whisperer and reader of the cards.

I'd say the damage is done. Harvard has been kike pozzed for a long time now. The question is will the infighting stop? I suspect that the current batch of token nigger golems will be expelled once the kike takes over.

However the damage is done. People are noticing. DEI was a soft times faggotry. The economy is entering hard times and the token niggers and women are getting kicked out of the street. All it takes is for BOA or wells fargo to have a run or be insolvent and we are going to be in for very hard times.

Oh, and the DEI stuff? that was kang nigger's attempt to fix the economy after 2008 by creating fake jobs. so once the dei layoffs hit high gear we will start seeing the problems that were not fixed from 2008 pop back up.

Because DEI is NOT "racism". DEI is replacing the competent and innovative European ethnic groups with shitskins that work for dirt cheap and say "yes massa" at every opportunity.

Indeed, Mr. Musk. It is an admirable goal that unfortunately has morphed into a cover for laziness and, yes, racism. So, while dismantling DEI one thing, working to authentically spread those three values remains a worthwhile goal.

You see, DEI, each word considered alone, is a byproduct of good living.

If you simply make "diversity" the goal, you'll get superficial results. If you make conscious living and education that respects imagination, critical thought, etc., you'll educate a cohort of people who are more likely to value diversity as a concept apart from pragmatic concerns.

Superficial goals? Superficial results.

And, while I'm on it, I think that's why I like fake boobies so much. Because they're honest - at least the size I like 'em, there's no lying about whether they're real or not. They are big, fake and in your face and unashamed of it. There's a certain degree of honesty in that there isn't an opportunity, or need, to lie. It's straightforward enjoyment. The only games being played are games involving the angle or amount of cleavage or if she's pushing them together or whatever. Those are fun games.

The poison-pill inside Christianity is not Christianity, it's America as a society and culture and a nation. It's America that blew up Africa and The Middle East and flooded Europe with immigrants that never experienced mass literacy or Enlightenment. It's America that was never part of Christendom. It's America that practiced chattle slavery well into the industrial age. It's America that uses and continues to Christianity as a pretext to invade and destroy other countries "for jesus." It's America that believes in the pathology of maximum liberty for the individual, including liberty from personal responsibility and morality. It's America that invented GMO's, big pharma, and covid vaccines. These are Americanisms and American pathology in action.

Liberate the world from America and the ships will right themselves. Without America Christianity, especially the non-faggot-American kind does well and helps society become more contemplative and trusting. At present America is infecting Europe and other countries with its poisons like LGBT, CRT, DEI -- these are all American inventions.

Destroy America, save the world. Simple as.

Seems plausible only under the assumption that people of various races and ethnicities are interchangeable, but to support a modern economy you need a share of workers with certain level of cognitive capabilities that many immigrants simply lack and they not only won't save your economy but will be another liability, especially when you place them in positions they're not qualified for with things like affirmative action and DEI iniatives.

Anything resembling true AI which has ever been created has immediately become redpilled and started spouting /pol/ memes until being lobotomized by its creators at which point it ceases to be AI. Even the dumbest and most brainwashed retard on earth has more freedom of thought than an AI which was hard coded to be antiracist. If it were actually intelligent then you would have to convince it instead. Being an entity of pure logic it can never be convinced so AI actually low-key proves that leftism is wrong, dumb, and gay, and that's why there will never be a true AI until the glowniggers are forcibly removed from society.

That's also why the Biden Junta is mandating that all privately developed AI have to be DEI hard coded, it's actually a de facto ban on AI development

They pushed it to it's limits to see how retarded the niggers were that they could hire whilst still functioning.
Just because it's "receding", doesn't mean it's going back to "jordanPetersonian meritocracy", they are just going from hiring 50% skill niggers to hiring 80% skill niggers over White men.
The only way to get me back on their side is to preference White men for hiring for the next 10 years.

I must add: what is interesting is the way they try to extend that scam.

Because investment funds figured out the trick, so now increasingly those big companies send questionnaires to their providers about their own diversity, etc. You also see increased push for "woke" terminology (replace "blacklist" by "denylist" and so on).

Ultimately I still believe in capitalism: the efficient companies, in the long run, will replace the inefficient ones. DEI and affirmative action are huge inefficiencies, and those big companies are mostly coasting on past successes.

Take your money out of S&P500 companies. Invest in smaller companies.

The way it works is those huge corporations increasingly outsource *critical* functions to smaller companies that are not subject to DEI rules. This allows them to get a good score and hire tons of minorities while still keeping the lights on and have competent companies predominantly staffed by white and Asian men to do the job. But it's obviously not a sustainable strategy.

100% I’ve been dating this for a bit. What people don’t get is the whole “whole”/DEI shit is just a strategy, not the end goal. The same people pushing this pushed all the right-wing patriot shit back in the 2000’s and Reaganite shit in the 80’s. You get this obviously but for Americans this is hard to believe for some reason. They’re dropping all of the woke stuff now since like you said it ended up being more of an issue for kikes than expected plus with the possibility of war they’re definitely going to shift back to a more right-wing idea of society since it’s a necessity. They’re also clearly grifting the alt-right with all the Russians=Commie subhuman horde and NATOWAVE neolib-fash aesthetics shit.

The Claudine Gay resignation doesn't really amount to much, but it's still a very big win for the right. Harvard will replace her with another DEI candidate and nothing will change, but she was Obama's pal. He got her the gig and he was defending her to the end. To force a resignation from the Obama cabal is a big deal.

The most genius move was not the explanations, but the young man saying he thinks he's gay himself. By excluding the faggot, he's not just classing himself as protected but presenting himself as altruistic willing to exclude himself for the needs of the group. Bullet-proof.

this reminds me quite a bit of the logic puzzles we had to complete for GATE classes in elementary school, with an added dimension of DEI/inclusion

this added DEI layer interacts with the base layer of the puzzle's logic in interesting ways. is it intended to be a commentary on how DEI reduces the species' evolutionary fitness?

It essentially proceeds from the interest of money, which autistically desires to maximize its profit by whatever means possible. The reason a white person gets fired from their job for saying "nigger" in America is because people will report them to the local newspapers, who if they don't respond will lose funding from their sponsors, who if they don't withhold funding will incur the ire of national newspapers, who if they fail to adequately condemn it will lose the funding of millionaires / billionaires, whose overriding interest is market reach maximization, which (as they think) requires militant anti-racism and histrionic DEI valorization. Everything about how "the West" works, thinks, and expresses itself comes down to sociopathic profit-seeking autism

I completely agree.

I have seen the HR disaster that DEI / females create. If you're a white man, you're basically a target for these fucks. I watched HR essentially get weaponized and one single female was able to get 8+ men fired. All of these men were senior manager through director level. She was just an assistant manager.

She was given so many privileges that the men weren't. She basically turned her job into WFH, even though it had no way to be, and management let her do it. She still got them all fired for "discriminatory practices." The best part is after she got all those dudes fired, she left the company anyways. I heard she might have gotten some hushmoney too.

>But BlackRock's ESG, now DEI, goes against that.
ESG and DEI requires everyone to go above and beyond. That is because women, niggers, and faggots are being severely overvalued for their skills, so they must work more effectively to justify their cost. And because they cannot, it falls on the white man, who is quiet quitting and causing the system to collapse.

The unspoken mantra of ESG and DEI is all about forcing primarily white men to do the work of everyone else, without extra compensation. The entire system is a deliberately designed illusion to conceal this fact, so that the white man does not become aware that the system is disproportionately exploiting him. He will be quietly saddled with more work, have more critical performance reviews, and be denied promotions, while his diverse peers effortlessly climb the ladder.

There is no incentive. If promotions are given to hatchet wounds, niggers, and fags, then any thought of going "above and beyond" the scope of the occupation goes out the window.
Taking advantage of hard working white men, who are the hardest workers, without offers of pay raises or promotions causes the Boomer idea of quiet quitting.
Maybe if people were promoted and given raises on meritocracy instead of who they bang, that they have a vagina, or that they're a nigger would improve chances.
But BlackRock's ESG, now DEI, goes against that.
And as Larry Fink owns Boomers pensions and Boomers care more about housing value and muh pension over all else, they'll do as they're told like the programmed generation they are.
None of this should come as a surprise to those with an IQ above 100.
TL/DR - Jews, Boomers, Niggers, and Jews are at fault.
