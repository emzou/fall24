I just love the karma. Jews were the founders of anti-white thought: CRT, DEI, affirmative action, worshiping the "The first black _" in every white space... these are all Jewish inventions. Now that they've made society anti-white, it backfires on them for having white skin. Delicious karma :)

Is it time to end DEI for male doctors? They clearly don't have the skills or knowledge to do the job properly. They just fall through the cracks due to male privilege whereas women actually have to work hard and show merit.

>Tsugawa and his colleagues examined data from Medicare claims made between 2016 to 2019. The data included more than 458,100 female patients and more than 318,800 male patients. Roughly 31% of both the male and female patient groups were treated by a female doctor.

>The researchers reported that the mortality rate for female patients when they were treated by a female doctor was 8.15% compared with 8.38% when treated by a male physician. The researchers regard this as a clinically significant difference.

>Among males, the mortality rate was 10.15% when treated by females compared with 10.23% for males.

Jews, middle eastern whatever, jeets, they are all the same.
Since the faggots can't deal with their problems they brought on themseves, they are trying to contain and isolate the problem to whomever they find inconvinient or unlikable. Except they are literally working with those who are causing the said problems, and are having a field day manipulating these fucking idiotic and naive SUBHUMANS trying too hard to larp as le master race while the entire world laughs at the third world America has become.
You can jump on a plane right now and go to anywhere in the world and find better environment than any metro area in US. This is not an exaggeration, it is an objective fact.
The ones at the helm right now don't give a damn about anything except sating their own wants, and their goal is to push the damage and blame onto anyone they don't like, except they barely represent the wants and needs of maybe 20% of White American population while having utmost desperate contempt for anyone else - especially their own who they don't consider to be up to their standards.
They hate people who tell them this, more than any third world freak actually raping and killing their way around the country. They would rather side with the enemy than spend one minute trying to actually solve the problem.
They eventually wind up flipping out on Russians over the Space cooperation, because they are enabling a bunch of malicious DEI hires and idiotic girls who shouldn't be in these organizations in the first place.
Good people are confused, barely getting by, being destroyed by these useful idiots larping as patriotic military or whatever masonic chapters in the South pretending they are in control of anything, when they are all just coping and hoping through a haze of pill popping sessions that something will get better after 2025.
It's a sick joke how easily they were manipulated by our enemies. Even after mass deportations, they will still make the same mistakes again.

You have no idea how much of a success chinese and iranian have had in subverting our universities and institutions to replace Americans.
The whole point of DEI policy is quite literally about turning our country into an unfuckable mess filled with DISGUSTING mutt faces they like to post so much, because they are backing the whole effort.
People are destined to EXCEL and uphold that which is great, beautiful, and good, not coddle dysgenic freaks and entitled girls who can't tell their left from right or live with no moral compass at all except their personal conveniences and wants.
Why is nothing working? Because at least half of the 'patriotic' problem solvers are just another side of the same coin as the existing 'deep state'. They just happened not to be child rapists and groomers, but of course, someone else will be victimized - someone they deem unworthy of their time.

I know exactly what you mean. That's the "buy in" I've mentioned earlier. Young white men just aren't buying in to society. A simple example of this is McDonalds. Go to any maccies and it's staffed almost entirely by young women. Young men are just refusing to work, and why should they? They'll never earn enough to do anything meaningful from a minimum wage so why bother. At the moment people are still kvetching about it but as this progresses they will genuinely have to start coming to terms with young men if they want them to contribute to society. We are starting to see that the DEI experiment has failed and you simply cannot replace white men with anyone else. White men built the modern world and white men are required to maintain it.

Perhaps the Ukraine business has been a wake up call for them and that's why we see all partied rolling back on the trans nonsense because they've been made explicitly aware, all across the West, that we aren't prepared to die for this shit.

Whether they'll reverse course completely I'm doubtful. I think they'll just offer enough carrot to get enough white men onside to carry on contributing to the system and start drip drip dripping their ideology back into the mainstream at a slower rate. I'm entirely of the mind, and have been for a good while, that the entire establishment is rotten to the core. That all of the elites are basically evil and need to be removed ASAP. I won't be accepting this little olive branch of them dropping the trans shit. I want them all gone.

I think they've reached the tipping point now though where DEI bullshit is seriously affecting their effectiveness. Have you seen that Fast Jets guy on YouTube? It's the same problem in thr RAF. They've got rid of a load of 50+ white guys, literally told them "this is the direction we are going, if you don't like it then get off the train". So absolutely loads of really experienced pilots and engineers just dropped out of the RAF and went working in civvy street. He even talks about how he stopped biting his nails from stress after leaving. The absolute funniest thing is that all their precious BAMEs and women just aren't applying to be fighter pilots. That's a job you've REALLY got to want to do and you absolutely have to be the best at it and utterly committed. So they have pictures of the new intake of pilots and it's all young white lads.

That's the thing the regime is just starting to come to terms with. That no matter how much DEI you push the foreigners just aren't buying in to our civilisation. They're not willing to fight for it, to defend it, to die for it. It's like when blacks say "we want black police in our communities" but there are no black police. Certainly not enough ti be able to police entire areas of major cities to pacify the blacks who live there. They don't want to do it because they're here on the take, not to defend our way of life.

This is a 1pbtid demoralization thread, but like all good controlled opposition, on the topic of young people's work expectations it is accurate.

I think it is a generational experience gap. Most people who have small to medium size businesses and are hiring for those businesses are older (40+). They don't understand what young people are going through and the change in the world & living standards in the West over the past 15 years. They have a fundamental disconnect from that world because they have already made it, they have property value grandfathered in, and they don't understand the political circumstances that have led to the problems young people face.
So when I ask for $25 an hour for highly skilled labor they recoil in shock, because they expected to pay $18 at most for such a role. But that frame of reference is out of date, even 4 years ago pre-pandemic.
Big companies can afford to pay low and be picky because they hire DEI candidates for cheap and the companies themselves are too big to fail, funded by BlackRock and Vanguard loans whose interest is outpaced by inflation.
Small companies can't afford to pay young employees what they're worth while allowing the business owner to keep up his boomer vacation home lifestyle.
Tldr: it's the jews and boomers will never catch up

How dare they not know how to do our niche specific job after we cut all training and the previous workers didn't train them as they bailed for a better job elsewhere.
This is everyone else's fault but ours. Won't anyone think of the shareholders? Don't they realize the value in gutting this company's assets then selling it to a private equity firm? That make stonk go up so it good!

>The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has pushed back production at its second Arizona foundry. The remaining major chipmaker, Samsung, just delayed its first Texas fab. This is not the way companies typically respond to multi-billion-dollar subsidies. So what explains chipmakers’ apparent ingratitude? In large part, frustration with DEI requirements embedded in the CHIPS Act.

>DEI — the identity-obsessed dogma that goes by “diversity, equity, and inclusion” — has now trained Google’s new AI to refuse to draw white people. What’s even more alarming is that it’s also infected the supply chain that makes the chips powering everything from AI to missiles, endangering national security.

>The law instructs the Department of Commerce to work with minority-owned businesses and make sure chipmakers “increase the participation of economically disadvantaged individuals in the semiconductor workforce.” The department interprets that as license to diversify. Its factsheet asserts that diversity is “critical to strengthening the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem,”

>requirements that chipmakers submit detailed plans to educate, employ, and train lots of women and people of color, as well as “justice-involved individuals,” more commonly known as ex-cons.

>the makers of humanity’s most complex technology must rely on local labor and apprentices from all those underrepresented groups, as TSMC discovered to its dismay.

>chipmakers have to make sure they hire plenty of female construction workers, even though less than 10 percent of U.S. construction workers are women. They also have to ensure childcare for the female construction workers and engineers who don’t exist yet. They have to remove degree requirements and set “diverse hiring slate policies,” which sounds like code for quotas.

So now Jews are switching sides to ally with the right. They know Trump is going to win. They know he's going to support Israel. They know Elon will stay in charge of Twitter. They know the Supreme Court is staying red. That's why people like Greenblatt from the ADL is attacking the purple haired college kids.

This as well, you shouldn’t forget that the only reason they are hired is DEI programs and that juicy Blackrock scoring and Government subsidies.
Companies lose money whenever they hire those people and they know it.
You pay them the same salary as everyone else, the same benefits for half the performance. A single factory floor in China could do the job for a quarter of the price, double the performance, zero benefits.

Why does anyone pay into any fucking institution if the money will be stolen? Why would I put anything in a pension fund if that's where traders dump stocks and the commies will get DEI joggers in who in turn will steal all the money?

i do homeless outreach in seattle. not with any organization but i've gotten 10-20 guys off the streets and clean the last few years. its quite literally impossible to be homeless in seattle and sober. there's so many programs. if they're youths, under 26 in this state you can get them a social worker and an apartment nicer than mine in less than a week.
they simply would rather smoke fetty and live in a city park or a car than be functioning human beings.
what do you expect when you take an entire generation of young men, have them graduate into the worst economic recession since the great depression, then when the economy recovers sell all their opportunity out to foreign invaders. its no surprise half my peers from a high school circa around 2010 in lake washington school district are dead or homeless addicts. thats a class of 2000 and half the kids in my yearbook already are dead from drug overdoses and shit.

a lot of people on sites like this are bots, that is because years ago they were used to share more sensitive information about governments and had better discussion, they were destroyed basically by botspam to render them incapable of being used as any sort of organizing tool or counter propaganda tool
I agree with your criticisms of some people but they don't apply to me, I shitpost in my free time in between actual life things, I just lie whenever I need to to navigate the DEI environment corporate or education wise and in terms of interactions with actual people I don't actually hate other races, I just love my own, and I can give people their props when it is due for their own history or personal actions etc, so I don't tend to have a lot of issues interacting with people, it is what it is but most of my friends are not even white, they're hispanic, black or south asian, I have some white friends but a lot of white guys are limp wristed and don't want to hang with me and do the kind of stuff I do, you would be surprised what a good unifying factor traditionalism and nationalism is when people aren't talking shit for no reason
to be real I even consider conversion to islam because a caliphate solution with different tribes and a lack of zina marriages works to solve the same issues without any sort of violence and the theology is good
been a lot of times I've been arguing for moral uprightness, outside of the context of ethnic issues, and found the only other person arguing on my side was a muslim, gonna get a bunch of faggots mad with this but it's the truth, I think that's the only way a multiethnic society could actually work is if it was theologically run like that

now, I don't think any of that will happen, but it's precisely because there is opposition from whites like myself and others, some reasonable like me, some not so much, and do you know why the unreasonable whites can't enact all the crazy shit they want? there's opposition from nonwhites to them, some of which is reasonable, some of which isn't

It consists of over one hundred full members selected from notable scientists, economists, business leaders and former politicians from around the globe.[1] It stimulated considerable public attention in 1972 with the first report to the Club of Rome, The Limits to Growth. Since 1 July 2008, the organization has been based in Winterthur, SWITZERLAND.

They're a symptom of the gaming industry. The large industry.

You have indies like theres too many to name but let's name a few

Against the Storm
Old World
Factorio
Dyson Sphere Program
AoE 2 : DE
Farthest Frontier
Manor Lords
Terra Invicta
Dune Spice Wars
Remenant 2

See all of these game are made by a team that really likes their damn game, these guys spend their free time thinking on how to improve their game, they like games, they like the game they're making it's their passion project and their source of income these are the guys you want.

Now let's take Dune Spice Wars, look at this picture, yes they're french and obviously some heavy DEI elements. But the game is still good. They don't let their fucking diversity metrics kill the game. There is also balance they didn't race swap the harkonen or atradies or anyone to black or whatever.

They instead took a random dune house never described and went hah these are the artists and the drug users and this came out.


Meanwhile you look at anything produced by EA, Ubisoft or any other company and you can FEEL that these games were not made by people who wanted to play the game but my some committee of managers and behavioral scientists trying to shape player behavior feelings or diversity metrics.

The gameplay, lore, world and everythign is up to debate. Nobody is a guiding light.

Look at Yoshi P and FFXVI it's not the best game but he didn't need to fuck around and go on an apology tour for not having black people in Medieval Europe because the SE guys know keeping him satisfied will make them much more money then anything Blackrock can invest into them.

And when someone does press the issue, we get this dumpster fire of a conversation before finally someone admits THEY DONT FUCKING KNOW EITHER.
I am not saying evolution does not exist.
I am not saying God didn't come down and do that.
I'm not saying some other 3rd party didn't come along and do it.
All I am saying is that the pretentious, pedantic assholes who act like they do know are fucking full of shit but nobody wants to admit it.
Same thing when these fart sniffing DEI fags are doing some kind of TED talk and they say something like "Institutionalized inherent privilege of the patriarchal oppressor class"
Then they get angry when it is forced out of them, just by asking
>What does that even mean? How?

It was supposed to be off under Trump, but he wanted Space X to be part of it
Space X needed to get their vehicle up and running, which delayed it all
Its why you'll hear about how Space X landed on the moon, theyre making the lander vehicle instead of simply relying ont eh Orion planned LDM

you mean the civilization that calls me and my people and gender privileged, despite the fact that statistically we do all the real work of keeping society running while DEI commisars make tons of money for doing jack shit nothing? The civilization that indoctrinates children both at home and abroad into sexual deviancy and if they are white hating their own people for shit that happened years ago and is categorically no worse than anything else in human history? The civilization that has flung its borders open to invaders so that the people at the top can keep their positions, regardless of the damage it is doing to the country?

I was banging this chick who picked up a Mercedes for $900/mo when she got a higher paying job in 2022. She got fired a few months ago, and recently asked me to make her car payments so she doesn't lose her car. I instead got her a pair of concert tickets for her birthday so she can take her best friend, and then I ghosted her.

At first, I wanted her to lose the car so she learns a valuable lesson, but then I realized that she wouldn't learn shit from it. Because when she started falling behind on payments, her first instinct wasn't to ask me for advice on how to manage the situation, she just talked cute and asked me straight up to pay for it.

It's crazy how fast women go from independent boss bitch to begging a man for help at the first sign of trouble.

Women can only talk about sex, body parts, how their boyfriend annoys them, or how they were embarrassed by a completely mundane life event.
Then you go to a man and he's talking about genuinely funny shit having to do with planning a vacation, attempting to learn new hobbies. Genuinely humorous observations from all walks.

The total collapse of the west due to low birth rates and mass immigration will lead to the greatest financial collapse in history, and the jews throne will crumble with it. What the jews didn't account for, was the only shield they had against their annihilation by the hands of muslims, was the white man - and they have worked tirelessly to dismantle their only aegis.

I think all of you are missing the bigger story here. This is a major change in legislation of America. A change in the fed/state in the power dynamic isn't taking place from fed reg state to state reg fed but it is the state claiming its right to police business in state wherein the business is intra-state/international, which is a change in the fed/state power dynamic because a state claiming the right to regulate is a challenge to a functioning fed govt domination over the states.

Look for state govt agencies to misinterpret laws on books to violate the BOR.

A new interpretation I'm taking away from this is that I'm starting to believe in a sociological struggle between classes of people wherein fed Jews are out to limit state power, the state's are out to get power back from the feds and that unaffiliated citizens benefit from that struggle between the two of them when the Feds tell the states that their police can't beat citizens while unaffiliated citizens are under constant thread from the Feds to take their self defense in cities dominated by fed DEI culture wherein minorities get prosecuted so infrequently that minorities stealing and committing violence against whites is almost codified by law.

I'm reminded of a George Floyd event wherein protesters targeted a homeowner with a Trump flag. They formed a mob and began taunting the home owner. He opened his kitchen door and began cleaning a shotgun. He was arrested for brandishing. This property owner was depropertied by protesters, police, and the district attorney.

Lefties identify with feds, Conservatives identify with states. Both are a mistake. Conflict between the states and the fed is best for the individual wherein both are so busy to accidently forget to bully individual citizens.

And maybe this is my chance to get some coomer anons on board with my philosophy.

there are two things i see happening that absolutely no one mentions anywhere which is why it's so suspicious. India and China still rely heavily on growth models that involve western consumption of product and resources - the west increasingly has a dysfunctional society where their DEI/ESG mandates, insane levels of financial and regulatory corruption, etc... are a giant snowball effect that will eventually cripple them if they don't isolate their markets and bring back manufacturing again. "But anon, it's too expensive to do that in the western countries!!!" but not if you never raise minimum wage and print money like crazy to inflate the currency.

The polarization with russia, the polarization with the middle east, the polarization with china and eventually india, the red sea and suez canal passage being cut off - all of these things hold to a pattern of the west planning to isolate their economic markets for protectionism. If they do it fast enough they can throw a wrench into the growth models of the east.

If I was Japan or Korea I would be pretty worried about the future right now.

Is it time to end DEI for male doctors? They clearly don't have the skills or knowledge to do the job properly. They just fall through the cracks due to male privilege whereas women actually have to work hard and show merit.

>Tsugawa and his colleagues examined data from Medicare claims made between 2016 to 2019. The data included more than 458,100 female patients and more than 318,800 male patients. Roughly 31% of both the male and female patient groups were treated by a female doctor.

>The researchers reported that the mortality rate for female patients when they were treated by a female doctor was 8.15% compared with 8.38% when treated by a male physician. The researchers regard this as a clinically significant difference.

>Among males, the mortality rate was 10.15% when treated by females compared with 10.23% for males.

I bet you anything it stems from two converging forces.
1) 2000s "grade inflation" concerns + DEI (affirmative action before) means they need a way to restore "meritocracy"
2) Somehow, Jews, Chinks and Jeets will get their hands on the world puzzles ahead of time.

Don't discount the role of #2. The excuse is to tape grade inflation with fuckery, but the reality is we know how certain demographics approach testing versus how others do.

Ironically, a host of modern corporations would value cheating as a kind of "team player" signal.

HW problems were much easier than what shows up on the exam and traumatizes you.
This is not even true.
Instead, state schools will have the professor give you a harder version of the test questions in lecture if you choose to show up and are smart enough to understand, and have the work ethic to take notes and study toward memorization and mastery.
They also grade on a curve. Typically sub 300 math courses grade with 70% as an A+.

Some higher tier schools have much less curving, and the test question is the hard version the professor showed rather than an easier version of what he showed.

At Harvard, however, it's all the easy version. Though most students are smart, but DEI has altered that.

Fat faggotted "nobles" taking all the money wealth out of the country and larping as 'enlightened citizens' in cafes and banquet halls of Vien, Prague, etc. while refusing to invest in their own land and people, going on to purposely hold back technological improvement, because it would've taken away from the pomp at their second summer retreat they were constructing while leaving their nation defenseless against outside forces.

People are inclined to wrongly blame others, but remember these people now openly admit they want to get rid of us, and they are succeeding with DEI now the standard in corporations across America. Denied education, denied jobs, denied participation in national life. Why? Because white men keep doing better than other groups and they concluded it is due to "systemic racism", and it is such a serious issue apparently they must violate our rights to do so

The thing is, we're not naive, all their word salad aside, in practice they are dragging us down and taxing us in favor of other ethnic groups and if you think so little of someone you violate their rights so easily, you hate them. If they really wished to uplift black people or something, there are plenty of better ways to do it, they could start with restoring discipline in inner city schools, but that is never a priority, it always comes down to the eradication of white people and white men in particular. Always, like a sniper's bullet, the exact same objective. Always remember how much these people hate you.

Total insanity. In the US, the minimum salary you need to avoid violent shitskins is 200k. That is bare minimum in a lower cost-of-living area. Around 350k to avoid shitskins completely in bigger metros. And you also need significant wealth to make a downpayment on a home (required to avoid shitskins). And you'll still have to deal with DEI anti-White shit at work, and your kids will have to deal with it in schools, but at least you won't be murdered by a shitskin on the street.

The only ideas they provide are to make their lives easier while working there while the men have to pick up the slack EVERY time.

Basically eye for an eye bullshit until the whole thing collapses.

This is a false flag you fucking niggers parade around when literally NO ONE has EVER done this without getting crushed by equal opportunitie laws.

It's unimaginably more fucked. I'm glad you were able to learn something here if you are being genuine. Once European countries are finished or potentially even before that, they will ZOGify Asian countries, too (more than already). If you are NE Asian then you would on average be more likely to be intellectually successful than certain other types of Asian, or Indians, or obviously Blacks. They will flood your countries with the detritus of the world when they're done here, and they will discriminate in favour of the detritus over you and your kin. It's what they do. They have to play whack-a-mole with relatively gifted races (subspecies) of human in order to support their bullshit narratives by providing the appearance of equal outcomes. They have to discriminate against Euros and NE Asians because, on average, those two races (subspecies) succeed better than the rest in a natural but still environment. This hurts fee fees and also makes it hard to pretend biological equality is real. So they accuse people of racism and legislate and incentivize to get companies and countries to do whatever they think will best support their shitty narratives.

Another example is in universities with student admissions. Whites and Asians in the West are discriminated against here, too, though Whites moreso than Asians. There are lawsuits by Asians about it (White lawsuits would be swatted down or called racist but Asians have a bit more luck fighting it). Of course, Jews, the Cult of the Chosen, are the most favoured and admitted despite their tiny demographics, but the DEI stuff causes significant favoritism for Blacks and other, on average, less cognitively advantaged races (subspecies) of human.

The sad truth is that most normal people AREN'T clued into this - they don't care. It's culture war shit. It's political nonsense.

>Isn't the idea of hiring someone without discriminating on their sex or race a good one?
But that's not what is happening in the real world, instead straight white men are openly discriminated against to fit diversity quotas. Does that sound right to you because in the real world that's what has been happening for decades. There is a good reason why all of this DEI stuff is pushed only in white countries no where else.

>Why pass over a gay man over a straight man if said faggot is more qualified?
That is not what DEI is about. DEI is about giving the gay guy the job simply because he is gay, it has nothing to do with qualifications.

>Why silence women when they can provide ideas to improve your company's processes?
Anyone can bring in new ideas. Just because a person has tits and a vagina doesn't mean they are magically bringing in revolutionary ideas that no one has thought of before. Besides no one is silencing women one bit when in reality they get preferential hiring because they are a woman.

>Why exclude others due to differences of sex/race/religion from stuff when that increases the rate of turnover?
No one is doing this, in fact the only people who are being openly discriminated against for their sex/race/religion are straight white Christian men. It's so in your face in society these days how have you not noticed it yet?

>Ive heard others say that DEI is inherently racist and sexist but I dont see that.
It inheritly targets white man and basically provides legal discrimination against them because they are labeled as the "oppressor" and everyone else a "victim".

Get with the times grandpa, equality doesn't matter anymore what is being promoted is equity which the idea of equality was the path leading to equity. Equity is basically taking from others i.e. white people and giving it to everyone else because of propaganda that every white person was born with a silver spoon and they got it through taking from non-whites and women.

This is the point he needs to understand to get it. Major banks and financial institutions promote this DEI stuff, and they incentivize corporations (and countries) to instate and practice it.

Read the thread, and I'll chime in with something that the other anons haven't included;

The problem with DEI isn't necessarily the wording - it is meant to be as "innocent" as possible for positive viewing by normies. Rather, it is a dogwhistle to certain political activists within governmental and commercial organizations to behave according to "social justice" and similar ideas under critical theory.

While you will be hard-pressed to find any laws FORCING companies/agencies to hire minorities > white people, you can find many cases of such organizations not being punished when they're exposed for having discriminated AGAINST whites, often citing reasons such as "social justice", "racial equity", or other such excuses. Think of it along the lines of a collection of people living according to a religious belief; they do not need modern law to direct them, simply a sincere belief that what they do is right or "for the greater good". And these people exist in our judicial system, corporations, and governmental agencies.

TL;DR: It isn't specific laws that create this problem, but rather significant numbers of individuals in positions of authority who operate based on a series of shared beliefs, who signal to each other their intentions via labels like DEI while their true goes go (hopefully) unnoticed by those unfamiliar with concepts like Critical Theory, Cultural Capture, and Intersectional Theory.

My time is limited so I cannot give you direct links, but I'd advise you to read into the works of Antonio Gramsci, Derrick Albert Bell Jr., and Kimberle Crenshaw - their works are the political lineage of this issue. Hope this helps.

The E stands for equity. Not equality.
Equality is equal opportunities for all.
Equity is equal outcomes for all.
You throw qualifications out and just focus on outcome. For example, 50/50 male female. If you have 7 men 3 women and need to hire someone, you have to hire a woman even if there's a better qualified man. This is the basic idea behind it. The leftists will argue qualification metrics are systemically racist/sexist and that it needs replaced with something more "inclusive". For example, if a programming job has a test exam that contains tasks to write code, they can replace that exam with a personality test. Then hire based on who passes the personality test which is designed to have women do as well or better than men.
Same with niggers and all the other protected groups.
In other words, DEI openly throws away meritocracy, which they believe is systemically white supremecist .

Im not arguing with you I just want some evidences and sources. Because I went through some dumb training from HR about DEI and I thought that was pretty okay so I dont know whats all the fuss is about over in the west where people are claiming that its bad. So some anon posted research that shows its bad. Which is a start but Im lacking the part where the government is enforcing the destruction of its own economy

>The purpose of this Act is to achieve equality in the workplace so that no person shall be denied employment opportunities or benefits for reasons unrelated to ability
It says unrelated to ability which I assume means they still hire based on merit. Is there a line that states otherwise or an example of a court precedent that enforces the idea of hiring based on race/sex instead of merit?

That's literally not what dei promises. It uses a "social credit" system to assign qualifications to people that aren't white or have other unfavorable socioeconomic factors. It is explicitly racist in its intent

You aren't talking about DEI retard, you're talking about the civil rights act. DEI is all about having niggers on staff because you must maintain a certain % of niggers on staff which would motivate an hr department to select under qualified people in order to satisfy DEI.

Perhaps in theory it could be beneficial to say all voices should be equally heard. Sure. In practice, however, it has just meant discriminating against white people.

I am not sure what you're asking me for, exactly, but many Western countries now have protocols to favour women, faggots, and racial "minorities" in hiring now. It does stem from legislation, but also propaganda and narrative weaving. Also promotion by financial institutions.

But that's besides the point, you asked why DEI might be bad. One of my studies specifically points out the downsides of a diverse workplace. There are other such studies, but they barely see the light of day because they go against the narrative.

The older generations are not tuned into the cultural trends and effects of any policy since they are financial and socially secured. The liberals among them want to promote things like DEI and feminism since they grew up in a world where there was a lot more misogyny and racism, and think men or whites should pay for their perceived wrongs. And they feel good at rigging the system in favor of women and dark skinned people of color. They are incapable of perceving the nuance and real effects of their own policies since they are blinded by the good feelings they get when they think they're the heroes and the good ones. The conservatives among the older generations are focused on their wealth. They convinced themselves that outsourcing and exploiting labor abroad was the free market and that they want to somehow perpetuate that type of economy that has negatively impacted America in all sorts of ways including its security against adversaries. Their view is that no one could possibly compete against them since they grew up in a time when the US was a dominant super power only, but they only stewarded its decline and the rise of a competitor they never thought could possibly compete because they were in part racist. The Chinese will be the US' main competitor this century, and the older generations of Americans ensured their rise to power.

UNforotunately in USA, due to Diversity hiring practices (DEI) and Affirmative action,
all government agencies (and Amtrack, largest trains, is owned by the gov),
all gov agencies only hire niggers.
You are going to have a nigger driver, a nigger conductors etc. You are going to have a lot of low iq niggers ride that train if its between 2 major cities.
>there are exceptions, some trains that go to white suburbs or college towns are pretty comfy

Then there should be a question of how and why did they make this biological weapon and released it.

...So their childrens could get no future prospects, get fired through DEI and quotas incentives, and absolutely get no jobs, no future, no descendence, by forced DEI and hyper normalization of interracial behaviour by jew / hassidic abiding corporations (almost all of them) and get their children indoctrinated and corrupted by constant gay and interracial propaganda in all medias, and now even more present in video games.

AI only serves to avoid a competency crisis by giving all the most common jobs to anything and everything that isn't white, but overall, the quality of every services have took a pretty clear nosedive since 2016 of the enforcement of these hiring quotas by jews.

All that is left now is to force in UBI tied to change of behaviour and only rewarding whites with points if they engage with a Troon or a brown / black woman.

The birthrates are already in pretty bad shape in whites by constant guilt trip and cattering only to their worst anxiety in all medias as they are too conscious and made extremely anxious of their environment and about climate BS, In less then three generations, the zlonlst saudis are probably right, there will be a complete extinction.of whites and their memory will only be part of folklores told in fairy tales or museums, but i doubt jews will even allow that.

This is true, but it inevitably goes both ways. That's what happened here in the USA with Obamacare. The healthcare industry gets to soak up (effectively) unlimited taxpayer money, and the government has a loyal partner to push their social agenda, like "gender affirming care", DEI, and so on. It becomes a partnership, but not to the benefit of the regular, normal person.

You and I both have the physical strength to beat a woman over the head, tie her up in a basement and rape her until she gets pregnant and, at the end of the day, the only reaspn this doesn't happen routinely is that other MEN of great physical strength come to stop it. This isn't to say women couldn't stop it, or that men would universally sign off on this, but look at the demographics. If everyone on 4chan formed rape gangs, the police would need to fight a gang WAR to stop it. There would never be a crackdown. It would last decades. If half of some Andrew Tate esque fucker did it, then they would do the same thing. Now, recognize that male virginity is rising globally and many of these men are, thanks to DEI initiatives, MORE COMPETENT than the people the establishment tends to hire, are younger and of militarybage, and increasingly have nothing to lose, and it's hard for me to not see some sort of massive incel backlash. I mean, fuck, who would even try to stop them? It wouldn't be the chads. Chads are wll over the internet pushing this the hardest, harder than even the incels most of the time. The establishment? It's filled with old people. Young men who rebel wpuld do so for the promise of a trad wife and Iranian laws to beat her if she steps out of line. What's the equivalent reward if you fight for the establishment, being yelled at for being male, divorce rape and being recorded being assalted by some chad's incel warband on tiktok while women watch and gossip, that's what. The only men who would resist would be older than the average Ukrainian soldier, maybe late 40s early 50s, and they will be outnumbered 5 to 1 by men in their 20s who actually want something, while the reward for the 50 year old is more shaming by a female led culture that will not value his sacrifice.

The USA is behind the times in weapons, with china being high tech and having rail guns.

The USA has not won a single Iran simulation in history, due to the mountainous geography of the region, the shape of the red sea, the cheap unconventional weapons of Iran, etc.

Since they expected the west to get baited into fighting it for them, like we had done in the past. From 10/7 saying that the west needs to attack Iran for them.

make them realize how what is happening right now on college campuses is beneficial to them (the right), the left seems to be eating itself, again I know and understand that these protests are against what is happening in gaza but we can't deny that there is a mix of DEI/anti-white tones to it, so I am using that as a hook to get their attention/understand that it makes no sense no crack down on these protesters as they have, infringing on constitutional rights (1st amendment) unless they are doing it as a favor to the Biden Campaign/Uni party (the same uniparty that just passed the ukraine/israel tik tok ban bill with no funding for the border), why do I see it as a favor to the uni party/Biden, because again these are protesters/voters that could have seated this one out but now.... Again they are reminded that the other party hates their guts and that ultimately you vote for who you dislike the least.
it seems that the protest will spread and will continue to hunt Biden through the remainder of the campaign, let it happen.

>"According to Lactantius,[6] a Latin historian of North African origins saved from poverty by the Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), who made him tutor to his son Crispus, Constantine had dreamt of being ordered to put a "heavenly divine symbol" (Latin: coeleste signum dei) on the shields of his soldiers. The description of the actual symbol chosen by Emperor Constantine the next morning, as reported by Lactantius, is not very clear: it closely resembles a Tau-Rho or a staurogram (), a similar Christian symbol. That very day Constantine's army fought the forces of Maxentius and won the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), outside Rome."

The SC takes cases to set or change precedent. They are ruling not only in the current case but all future similar cases on both extreme ends. This is why these hypotheticals are asked.
This is why you don't put DEI judges on the panel, you get comments stating that they should try to rule on this Trump immunity case in one way and "be" allowed to rule on others a different way, which is what the diversity oppointee did near the end in this exact hearing.

I had a theory that to establish harmony in America, simply distinguish all metropolitan areas as independent administrative governing zones. These zones to be walled off like West Berlin was. And then you elect batshit progressives to run these places with zero zoning laws and free gibs to DEI people overruning them with migrants from all over the world but they can’t leave these areas as that would constitute illegal entry like climbing the US-Mexico border wall, and then see how far they’d go to jump on yids.

You now live in a DEI world. Anyone who doesn't operate with a defensive mindset is a victim. Canadians and the rest of the west have to stop living in the 1960's and pretending assimilation was ever a thing. It's multi-cultralism, and the cultures do not mesh. If you leave your car unlocked with the keys in it, blame yourself for someone stealing it. Adapt to living around jeets or be subsumed.

Exactly.

Previously, when america was vloser to a closed loop system, you had to pay the necessary wages for life in an area because you physically couldn't access non local resources/labor/move your factory or means of production.

The true hollowing out has occured because businesses have no actual obligation to serve the community/people around it due to deregulation, globalization, and modern tax codes. Since they aren't tied to any one place/governing body, the motives shifts to number go up, and nothing more. Any of the pandering to dei or environmentalism is so the number can go up more.

Its not directly the corporations fault, but the government for not keeping them at bay via antitrust, anti lobbying, tax codes, etc.

America will go full balkan at somepoint to restore the natural order that OP mentions. When society is globalized to the point we are, no local institutions can afford to exist even if they are purely positive because the larger institutions can externally displace things such as currency, social programs, so on so forth.

The only people in the US who have learned to counter this are the Amish. Their faith is the only thing holding them together because federal and corporate institutions have removed every other aspect of control over a community from them.

The root of the problem is nobody actually cares how good the instruction is. The point of college for the US is an informal IQ filter. Ivy leagues perfected the selection process a long time ago and as a result stopped focusing on improving education. Lately their selection process has been poisoned by DEI so they stopped providing the value they used to. They're taking small steps to correct this though.

common core is just an extension of no child left behind. Civilizations have core ideologies. Healthy civilizations ensure that their ideology overlaps with reality as much as possible, and when reality goes against their ideology they make one off exceptions and compromise with reality. Unhealthy societies become captured by their ideology and first deny reality and then try to force reality to comply with their ideology.

Under the soviets there was something called lysenkoism which was a form of biological lamarckism. Basicly they denied heritability and genetics and said that organisms pass on the characterists of the way they lived onto their offspring. Like the argument that if a giraffe stretched its neck its whole life to reach leaves high up then its offspring wouldbe born with longer necks. They did this because their core ideology required everyone to be equal, and if heritablility were true it would be heirarchies are natural, valid, and desireable. So they applied lysenkoism to agriculture and caused a famine that killed millions, sowing grains that were unsuitable in land that was unsuitable.

The same thing is going on in the west as we are a sick society in decline. We also demand that all people be equal. At first we denied the reality that some races are less intelligent and invented systemic racism as an explanation for their poor performance. Now were forcing reality to adhere to ideology by DEI requirements putting unqualified browns in medical and scientific positions. Common core is an extension of this because if we can't find a way to raise up inner city black students we can at least make everyone equal by dragging down white students to the black level of achievement. Just like lysenkoism, reality will reassert itself and millions will die.

Exactly wrong. The reason the US doesn't have decent public transportation is because civil rights policies like bussing chased Whites out of the cities, starting the process of urban decay. After that, it simply didn't make economic sense to build rail as most people lived in suburbs with much lower population density.
And the flip side to forced diversity is much higher competition for the few non-diverse opportunities, meaning any whites who get these opportunities will be much more competent than otherwise. This obviously can't compensate for the DEI hires, but it goes part of the way there, and does enough to make claims of the "competency crisis" null.

They already do in some states. Every year you pay an excise tax based on the initial price of the car and this only decreases to a certain percent after a set number of years. It never depreciates to zero. And now that cars cost as much as a small house used to, the tax is fucking ridiculous. I pay $200+ yearly on a 24 year old car for the privilege of driving and the roads here are some of the worst I’ve ever driven on. The governor has redirected the money from road maintenance to DEI initiatives and housing illegals.

Nah it's gonna be like every other time. The brand is going to either go broke or significantly damaged while comsoomers keep it marginally profitable.

They bent the knee years ago and put out a "diversity statement" after Trump got elected because people were using GEOTUS(God Emperor of the United States) and even though that was a meme they had nothing to do with aside from it using lore from their product, they were so offended they felt the need to release a statement.

The only thing that has kept them from doing this shit before is that the autism of TableTop players about lore is extreme and there wasn't DEI money to offset the sales drop. Now a licensing deal with there and the cucks don't mind if they ruin the product.

Dissident's support China because its industrial powerhouse will ultimately topple ZOG's financial stranglehold of the world, usurping judeo-unipolarity. Thanks to Chang, Pax-Weimericana is no longer an interesting offer for the 2nd world satellites. Chang offers you all the consumer goods you need for a 1st world standard of livng, and will also build you vital infrastructure to achieve it, without forcing you to adopt "Chinese values". ZOG on the overhand offers nothing but debt-slavery, DEI, foreign-ownership, sanctions, bombs and bullets dropped on you, and puppet regimes, to carry out their talmudic agenda.

That's a low level take. The argument is that the blacks have been discriminated against for centuries so their lack of representation at the top and in the middle is a result of historic racism so we must give them fast-tracks to the middle and the top in order to create immediate redress of the outcomes of historic racism. This argument is wrong in two ways, first conceptually in that fast-track people will be qualified for middle and upper management - they won't, they never are, if you fast-track you can't learn the life skills and gain the personal experience required to make you understand the world and your place within it. Second by definition if you take on several generations worth of blacks in a single cohort you're going to get a lot more shit ones than you would have gotten if you had taken on a few blacks each generation. Some problems can't be fixed with large, sweeping actions, if they want true racial equality the only "DEI" policy would be "stop being racist." Then the blacks, if they're intellectually able, would rise through the ranks to the top jobs.

I agree that it's all the fucking jews hiring niggers because fuck whitey, but still, your explanation was simplistic.

DEI Biden is your Bolshevik Jewish candidate (Jewish supremacy domestically via destruction white people) while Zion Don is your Zionist Jewish candidate (Jewish supremacy geopolitcally via leveraging white nationalism for solely Israeli interests). They both exist to solely serve Jewish interests which is why they both always fall in lockstep behind Jews while neglecting everyone else. Biden gives American Jews their pacifiers by promising to "protect" them from apparent antisemitism in America as if outright control of the entire country wasn't enough. Zion Donny doesn't challenge this either, he's just moreso interested in dick sucking Bibi for Israeli purposes. Neither of them address the migrant invasion at our border with their actions. They sure do get the money rolling for Jews though.

We have brought discord, and confusion and frustration into your personal and private lives. And we have done it all without bullets, without weapons. We've done it entirely through the irrestible might of our spirit; through ideas, through propaganda. We do all this with memes and language, and it makes Jews so dumbfounded and fragile that they quite literally have held Congress meetings about it. You are losing.

Former AB Wildfire officer here. (Quit during COVID).

This is all true. Our budgets were slashed but here’s the thing. They targeted the layoffs on the most junior, white male roles. Ie. the guys who do most of the work. We were already very top heavy with management. Now it’s worse. And everyone they’ve hired or replaced in the meantime, has been a DEI hire.

Even the quality of the seasonal hires - who are the workhorse of the organization, men with boots in the ash - has dropped massively. Between Natives who are these days more urbanized and less interested in working, to the summer students being fewer, browner, more feminine (either outright women or worse trannies) and overall far less reliable. Their entire hiring practice is based on a Soros model for excluding white males and hiring whatever brown trash slimes its way in. And pikachu face when they quit or go AWOL.

I keep in touch with a few of the scarce remaining ‘good old boys’ and they tell me it’s an absolute nightmare. People who can’t or won’t do their jobs. People getting hurt and even dying because of it.
Meanwhile the Boomers in Management only care about coasting to their pensions and getting out with their golden parachute.

And it’s going to get worse. Way worse.

You're going to blame this on DEI, but this is something much more. I think Space X NASA is trying to do it for real and we are seeing what it would really take to do it. Werner Von Braun originally proposed what they are planning now - establishing a space station in orbit around earth where fuel could be stored to allow ships to reach the moon. This method was inexplicably thrown out and they just launched straight from the ground directly like he had never even proposed it. Obviously, the implication is it was impossible for them at the time - but then so was travel to the moon.

There were some early sign like retarded children books with full on DEI but it was obscure and didn't touch the main lore. This is the first full on DEI fuck you on a issue most Warhammer nerds cared about. Now no one can excuse this anymore. I think it will hurt GW as they were several times almost bankrupt. If just a percentage of the whales fall off this will hurt immensely. Maybe they dream of becoming another Marvel. Abandoning their core business to become a massive film studio. This will obviously fail as there isn't an audience for a pozzed Warhammer cinematic universe. The nerds will drop it and the blue hairs didn't care from the start.

So the divided USA is the case because of mass immigraiton, a multiracial and multicultural society is a divided one, is why jews love it! It's why they want it.
Amazing how they manage to blame donald klompf for it. It was already divided before he went down the escalator.
And when the brown coalition finally breaks up, which they have made only to have them all vote together and attack euro americans so they can't vote th emselves out of it. When it breaks apart you get the total racial balkanization that usa already is. Because the 'brown' races there's no such thing it's different races with nothing in common racially and culturally. They try to get them all to behave and talk like afrocan americans, but how long is that going to last? rofl.
This is why they use the fake 'white' and 'brown' labels, to have false unity. When there is nothing to unify over in terms of race or culture.
You take 40 different races, and you call them 'brown' and then pit them against blonde and blue eyed people in USA which are barely any, and you tell other europeans, that they are 'brown' if they don't have that. So they get on team brown too. And it's all 100% bullshit, every single part of it! ROFL

But anyways it should be concerning to actual europeans what these students are doing. They do not hate israel cause it's jewish, they hate it cause they have taken the propaganda at face value and this makes jews 'white males' and israel then 'white supremacist apartheid state' blablabla.
They don' t realize that 'white' was code feor i hate europeans. So by going on pigmentation only, what is jew but a rich white male? What is israel but a 'white supremacist' rofl
100% chance this was going to happen, and the american jews are so fucking retarded they kept pushing this white supremacist nonsense. They getting rooted in dei, affirmative action, everything. Now they classified as 'whites'.

The only non-retarded reply in this thread.
There is only one thing that will stop the majority electorate (females) from continuing to vote civilization-destroying policies (birth control, plan B, no fault divorce, child support, DEI, etc.), and that is a total system collapse. They WILL NOT repeal the 19th amendment themselves. A solar flare causing an EMP that directly hits NYSE is probably the only thing capable of taking out financial system (or a massive MCE over the US taking the electric grid down). This will blow the US (and the global reserve currency) back to the stone age taking the world with it this time. Police would immediately realize they're not getting paid to protect someone else's family. They throw their badges on the ground and then the purge will begin after food riots 72 hours later.

Nothing short of a full societal collapse will force females to bend the knee and acknowledge every comfort of modern civilization was gifted to them by Gods they call mid men every day. Faggot "strong" daddies who raised their little princess to be mini-me versions of daddy will again be handing off their 12yo princess to 45yo men who will be the only ones capable of taking on the burden because 12yo boys can't do shit for her. Then females can be supervised as nature intended.

Until that day, it will be a slow decay into planet of the apes.

Embracer has a very good vision for how a publisher should engage with studios - but they definitely bought too many studios.

I'll explain:
Everything they bought was up for grabs - there was *widespread* failures happening years ago which is what Embracer tried to capitalize on. The difference is Embracer wants to stay hands-off of studio operations, so if Volition wants to commit to DEI, they can and if 4A wanted to become slavic nazis, they could.
The problem is Volition's project was hugely expensive, and failed. This was a massive blow to Embracer. The same happened with several of the poison pills they purchased.

Should Embracer have taken the risk to protect Volition? Probably not - the spirit of the decision was fine, but they didn't even think to look at the motivations of the teams. The assumption would naturally be "they want to make a fun new entry in Saints Row", they were wrong.

My hope is that Embracer gets through this and also mandates a single thing: no real-world political or cultural themes unless they are intrinsic to the intellectual property. "representation" must be core to the property, if it is an existing property then being completely loyal to the property should be mandatory.

I don't have the money to move to california or move anywhere. I'm basically stuck where I'm at. Plus 20$/hr isn't shit in California. I have a decent size house and 2 car garage here in the midwest. Just saying that I'm basically a senior systems engineer and barely make more than min wage workers in Cali because my company hires a bunch of DEI people and then load White men like myself with work because I'm competent at what I do.

Life just isn't fair, which is why I try to go fishing as much as possible. It takes my mind off the corporate life, and I get to meet sexy babes when the weather is nice. If it weren't for fishing I'd probably off myself.

I paid 20K$ in state + federal taxes this year alone, and I know that money just goes to shitskin spics crossing the border illegally under the jew biden administration. They just steal money from workers and use it to fund our replacement. I don't know what to do anymore. I think I need to join an active club or something. I can't take this much longer

I'm a wagecuck and I don't hate NEETs at all. You guys have it figured out. I paid 20k$ taxes between 18,000$ federal and 2,000$ state. That amount is worth more than both of my cars and it's over 1/5 the cost of the house I live in.

The company I work for keeps hiring DEI candidates who don't do shit. I'm responsible for over 25 different systems and I don't get paid shit. I'm barely making more than min wage fast food workers in cali. People quit all the time and instead of hiring competent engineers they just hire indians and managers... Life is hell

I am a wageslave and life is miserable. My only solace is going fishing after work in the summer and meeting hotties while I'm fishing. It's my only escape. I hate this website and I hate the internet, but I don't hate NEETs. I don't blame them.

The memes are also hilarious, like this one:

No. Leftist women do. I’ve been gaming since Atari 2600. I’ve never complained about anything. I’ve been an MMO “Raider” since 2007. Before that I played with friends through lan as far back as Quake, Doom, Redneck Rampage, and Blood. I never forced my will on anyone and when I was told to “git gud”, instead of complaining, I studied my class and busted my ass to improve my logs and got better making myself an asset to the team. MOST gamers who are female are the same way. In all my years gaming, I’ve never met any of these scrub bitches that are being elevated by the establishment. You are having a knee-jerk reaction to Edomite conquer and divide tactics. Settle down. If you weren’t such an insufferable midwit, you would be able to recognize the pattern of jewish government using a select group of women and a gaggle of niggers to do their goying. The legislative body of women in the US is less than one third, 26% world wide. DEI and other woke shit is forced on corporations by the government neither of which are run by women. Women are NOT in control and never will be. They are tools. Simple as.
>pol: women are stupid and worthless
>also pol: but powerful enough to destroy everything
/pol/ acts like those niggers who brag about teaching white people how to wash their ass before promptly being enslaved by them. That’s a not a win!
So, are you a nigger? If you were a terrorist you’d probably bomb a bunch of randos instead of bombing important government buildings and politician homes. Keep blaming women. That outta fix the problems.

That's just not true. The SweetBaby issue is a consultant (which has 2 vested interests, first to prove they're worth being hired by a game dev studio and their own biases, like the CEO's desire to basically cram 'representation' into games by doing so ) and that's the problem. The ESG/DEI thing is completely separate - ESG/DEI is basically a marketing term for investment and corporations, and just like with green shit a percentage do "wokewashing" as "greenwashing".

Not t mention that if yu can max out your DEI/ESG plan with no mention or very little of game content (ie look at capcom's for instance, its public. Most of it is literal old folks gaming community charities, using less energy and renewable sources, governance where there's input from the community, sponsoring pachinko rehab etc). there's no reason to bother with fucking with your prime content. The reason they change stuff in the game is very simple
>They have been led to believe that they need t do so to sell the game now, access new markets etc
They're told
>Oh you cant save the princess anymore, that's not correct. The West will have people go n twitter negatively talking about the game. So don't do that
or
>There's a whole host of people who don't buy the game now who might if we make X change, lets do that! OH what about our existing fans? Well marketing says they're not likely to leave en masse only a handful, but think of all the NEW people who would buy it.
and other kinds of shit. There's a lot of potential , but its just plain old capitalism being capitalism, no different than
>If we add loot boxes some of our players may get mad, but look at the huge amount of money we can make if even a percentage of people buy them
similar shit. Its really not a "stamp of approval" from some top down issue.

ESG/DEI is often bullshit conspiracy garbage, but the "sweetbaby" issue is sound - whenever you have companies who are so distorted that they think that either A) they need to hire consultants with vested interests who want everything to be different in every game in terms of design, characters, etc.. or B) they think its a better bet to censor/woke-ize things because tards on twitter say so and they're loud etc... that's an issue.

A lot of stuff is distorted about ESG/DEI and morons who make up huge conspiracies don't help, but that's independent and ther'es an intersection with the kind of people who are demanding that "problematic" content be changed in gaming, to say nothing for devs overseas like Japan who are told "oh you can't do these things anymore or else the game won't sell in the US because its offensive" based on the advice of a handful of social media morons

They're not. They process everything through an oppressor vs oppressed and white vs non-white lens. To them, Israel and Jews = more white people, aka colonizers and genociders. That's literally all it is, and the great irony is that kike professors and media heads are responsible for a lion's share of perpetuating that narrative to them. I guess they just didn't think their own lion they had been feeding would one day bite them.

Say jews. Woke leftists, brownoid migrants, blacks and homosexuals only have clout in the west because of Jews. Jews hate healthy, well turned-out white people and use the coalition of the aggrieved as a tool of subversion. Some of those are turning on Israel in reaction to its heinous crimes, so jews are yanking their leash to bring them to heel. Unless you are jew, pointing this out is not the own you think it is. Jews are not about to expel or suppress these people, they're just going to establish a carveout exception for jews. DEI will become "Diversity, Equity, Israel"

Obviously most gyps kept this as a secret but many of them talked about it here and there.

Back the this was unimaginable for me. The scum of the earth without the ability to speak English or look human just going there and getting free money multiple times more than my wages plus everything paid for.

"The root" is a small group of people, but Larry Fink is just one of the most prominent faces they show to the public. The fact that Fink is so out there, taking the hits for being the face of DEI/ESG proves that he's just a middleman. Going after Fink is actually what they want. It would accomplish nothing but exposing those who oppose them, and Fink would be replaced in short order.

The browing of israel is inevitable. Ashkenazi's are the foundation of International Jewry and are the main factor of why israel and the jews in general are such a problem. They will soon be out numbered by browns and muslims no matter how hard they try to keep israel for the jews.
I also have a feeling that the right leaning government in israel will be overtaken by liberals and the same dei hiring will happen in israel as well. jews sooner than later are going to expirance diversity enforced by their own golems and they'll be powerless. israel has run out of victim cards.

bc it's not even true especially for vanguard. "assets under management" means very little to vanguard bc they run passive index funds, so they buy a little bit of a bunch of stocks with the money they're given and take a tiny fee, they don't even pick the stocks so they don't make any decisions that make an influence. black rock has both passive and active investments, but most of it is passive just like vanguard. it's a liberal talking point so people say "vanguard bad". and neither one really influences companies, think about it, if one company goes rogue and decides not to have dei policies, then the theory goes blackrock decides not to buy their stock? or not to buy their bonds? so whatever company doesn't do dei would be undervalued, wouldn't it? or their bond returns would be higher than it should be? in either case you could easily make money knowing this, but of course that's not what is happening in reality.

The KGB is essentially responsible for everything that has happened under the Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Biden administrations that damaged the US’s standing in the world such as endless wars, economic decline, racial division, critical race theory in schools, DEI quotas in corporations, and endless third world immigration, but the one president who at least made an attempt to put a stop to their subversion was stonewalled at every turn by Congress and smeared and investigated for being a “Russian asset” by media and intel agencies?

Because to me it really sounds like “the KGB” has its hands in congress, presidential administrations, intel agencies, and media outlets, and is aggressively stopping anyone trying to remove their influence.

I've no idea who even runs Hamas, tis said to be the Mossad, but that's globohomokikenigger territory, and whatever.

It's not entirely up to the colleges. The DEI comes down from Blackrock and Vanguard. So IMO they will try something similar, but at a different angle.

And no.

Or atleast its like the baltimore bridge collapse, where regardless of some cyberattack involvement, theres a bedrock level that undeniably is our own incompetence. In the case of KGB attributed disinformation, its our own governments that shutdown for covid, that mask mandated, that required vaccines, that support BLM, that opened our borders, that printed 1/3 of our money in a year, that got us off the gold standard, that requires DEI policies in schools, institutions and companies, etc. these are impossible to be any external source. Disinformation could maybe exaggerate those, but their existence and our governments reactions is our sides fault somewhere.

Never understood the appeal.
This idiot made it a POINT to never, ever talk about solutions or anything practical.
Really, just ANOTHER useless "DEI" (before such a thing existed) diversity hire from when Jews took over the US.

See:
Playboy: For many years, American letters seemed dominated by Southern writers, but, as you have said, “during the last ten years the large percentage of the more talented American writers are urban Jewish intellectuals.” How do you feel about this shift in ethnic, geographic and literary emphasis?

Capote: Well, it has brought about the rise of what I call the Jewish Mafia in American letters. This is a clique of New York-oriented writers and critics who control much of the literary scene through the influence of the quarterlies and intellectual magazines. All these publications are Jewish-dominated and this particular coterie employs them to make or break writers by advancing or withholding attention. I don’t think there’s any conscious, sinister conspiracy on their part—just a determination to see that members of their particular clique rise to the top. Bernard Malamud and Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and Isaac Bashevis Singer and Norman Mailer are all fine writers, but they’re not the only writers in the country, as the Jewish literary Mafia would have us believe. I could give you a list of excellent writers, such as John Knowles and Vance Bourjaily and James Purdy and Donald Windham and Reynolds Price and James Leo Herlihy and Calder Willingham and John Hawkes and William Goyen; the odds are you haven’t heard of most of them, for the simple reason that the Jewish Mafia has systematically frozen them out of the literary scene.

BlackRock and Vanguard are the two biggest investors in gaming, and their sole motivation appears to be injecting games with as much ESG/DEI stuff as possible. Stuff like this largely alienates people who play videogames, and results in lower sales. How can companies like BlackRock remain profitable when all their initiatives directly contradict public interest?

For a few years, I was called racist, bigot, and I don't know what else. After all, the country I was born and grew up in and occasionally had a job in, was after all massively supplied gas by Russia.
What you are seeing all around the world is: countries with good GDP are celebrating their weakest. And when they get greedy and go too far, they enter a recession (DEI).
Even then, most importantly: they are not ruled by Russia at the end of the day.

In a nutshell the only important and useful languages in history have been Indo European, Sino, or Semitic.

In terms of prominent distinguishing features:

>Indo European languages, especially proportional to their age, pack the most grammatical information into words, e.g. through verb conjugations and noun declensions. This leads to using fewer words to represent the same idea. For example in an ancient Indo European language like Latin, “opus Dei” is two words which fully encode the idea of four words in English “the work of God”. Therefore more informationally dense, because particles like “of” are implied by changing the noun slightly, etc.

>Semitic languages preserve etymological roots best, which allows one to connect patterns between related nouns, verbs, etc. For example the word for writer and the word for book will sound a lot more similar to each other in Semitic languages than European ones. e.g. Arabic كاتب/ كتاب kaatib/kitaab for writer/book

>Sinitic based languages that use Chinese writing have the unique feature of being logographic like number symbols 1,2,3. Just like I read 6 as six and a German reads sechs, the symbol itself is independent of a particular language so that you could theoretically write any language using Chinese characters. As a result, the language is analytical and context oriented, but has the advantage of packing a much deeper potential meaning into each character. The character is less of a “word” and more like a semantic symbol that can function in many complex ways, or be combined with others into a more developed idea.
For example the word for fuck (cào 肏) is literally enter (rù 入) + flesh (ròu 肉) lmao

It's gonna be hard to get anyone to fight side by side with the kikes. No zoomer wants to do it, partly due to being so entitled and essentially all have essences of ASPD and NPD, with many truly having it. But, even if they actually weren't so entitled, and actually were patriotic, they still wouldn't want to fight for pissrael

See picrel for leaked USA military email, talking about how right after the Al-Aqsa Flood on 10-7, the troops openly revolted when the topic of possibly risking their lives to fight for the kikes, so the kikes wouldn't have to fight their own war.
> They weren't having any of that
> They kicked out all the patriotic white males that simply follow orders, and replaced em with DEI mutts and trannies
> So, none of them were willing to even entertain the thought, and openly revolted and made it clear that they wouldn't fight

Zoomers on both sides hate the kikes, and don't like pissrael. Half of zoomers either don't believe the holohoax was real, or think that it didn't happen.
> It's part of the reason that despite the govt and media trying to prop up pissrael, zoomers never caved and now support pissrael even less.

go watch a cop audit channel and then perceive, per capita, which group of people is responsible for most incidents. hispanics, blacks, and women are overrepresented in their unconstitutional actions, in that order. These bad police (and this applies to the bad white officers, too) perceive their position as one of absolute authority, uncontested and unchecked by anyone other than their superior, and they will kill you to prove how in control of you they are. It isn't done for public good or safety, but for their own ego, a display of dominance, and if someone of superior morality and intellect crosses paths with these freaks it will send the subhuman amoral officer into a rage that is unquenchable. All the perceived slights they have ever faced in their long lives will be placed as a burden upon some poor and unwitting civilian. Now imagine what happens when it is a white civilian trying to explain anglo-saxon legal theory to even a third generation non-white. It will never resonate. mens rea and color of law mean nothing to these people, it's like trying to get a slug to do math. If the best latino immigrants became police, this would be an entirely different situation, but a police officer is basically relegated to a midwit job in the US, and with DEI shit, it means what was once a job for 110 iq individuals is now a job for 95 iq diversity hires that are culturally distinct from Americans. Have fun with your mercenary group that will kill your entire family for a paycheck and won't give a shit.

Here comes all the mutts claiming the US only takes in higher caste jeets. H2B jeets are low caste jeets that cheated at their diploma mill and are brought over by nepotistic jeets hired by DEI. Jeet doctors exclusively work for Kaiser because it's the largest recipient of Medicaid/Medical patients. Mass produced healthcare for low/middle class. Jeet engineers are just as bad. Example being Lockheed, Boeing, or any FAANG that's currently being eaten from the inside. I earn enough not to encounter niggers on a daily basis, but jeets are inescapable.

I won't deny that Executive Orders 13279, 13583, 13665, and 14035 have their part, but the predominant modern mechanism is DEI funding. Investment firms/banks will NOT loan money to companies that do not comply with the ideology. Which means pretty much any corporation (you go public in order to get funding, after all) is the bitch of these investment companies, and must accept their terms in order to receive funds. And those terms are "diverse leadership", and they just so happen to know some people who fit that niche, so they need to be let into the company or they have to hire a DEI firm like >>465735083 talked about in order to help you write a DEI compliant script for your story, nevermind that those people are pushing the ideology.

A little bit of evidence that this is going on:
Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, explains how you have to "force behaviors":
https://twitter.com/shadygrooove/status/1665383288645603329

BRIDGE, a renaming of DEI that takes the ideology even further and requires even the employees to parrot the ideology and prove that they believe in it in order for the company to qualify, and is making it's rounds. There were some videos somewhere on Twitter of the CEO, Sheryl Daija, explaining how employees of companies, not just the management, were going to have to "step up and do the work" of DEI in the future.

Everyone knows now or starting to get it that women in the workforce provide very lil productivity. They just take away but it's not a problem for corporations as 90% of domestic spending is done by women. The money they earn instantly goes back to kikes. Men make bottlecaps because society gotta sustain a bunch of freeloading women with fake jobs. Then there are the tax cuts and esg and dei initiatives to financially support companies employing enough of them.

Basically men are broke because government prefers a bunch of infantile voters with the emotional mautirty of 14 year olds and impulsive spending habits.

The best way to compete is to not compete at all. Men should go full neet and side hustle until these things change but too many simps are living paycheck to paycheck, being absolute slaves to a society that scams them and they don't even know.

The show pushes DEI with fat POC troons and women. The show is like all other adaptations, it’s crap. And you have s0yb()y shills promoting the fuck out of this series. Just nope, haven’t seen an episode and don’t want to, can already tell it’s a waste of time. Fallout 1,2 and new Vegas are the only good ones. Cope.

My top picks have already been mentioned in this thread. The best would be obviously Desantis by all measures. Proven track record, same trump policies, solid 2028 candidate (which its typical for VP picks to be platforms for presidency runs) and he was the only real competitor in the primaries. JDVance would be a much further down second. Probably third place, but I cant really think of a second place pick atm. I think he would be good, but theres not nearly as much proven record of him like desantis. Ofcourse I highly doubt Trump will pick either, as its not about "best" its about who will most likely win. General election winners are a popularity contest between the lowest 51% on the bell curve and the control class who ultimately have the say. Bets would be on a DEI pick to appeal to some voting block trump is weakest in, plus considering Trumps pick of mike pence last time, trump seems like hed probably want someone who doesnt back talk or overshadow him, so id look for a woman or if a man, some man that blends in.

It seems to me like a limitless source of cheap, clean power. Using a relatively small amount of uranium fuel you can provide lots of electrical power. No air pollution. And just bury the waste in a properly sealed chamber deep underground.

>Chernobyl
Shitty reactor design with a retarded political system. But even then, the dangers are hyped up. People can live relatively close to the reactor site now without too many health problems.

>Fukushima
Massively exaggerated. The levels of radiation released weren't that bad.

Granted, taking massive doses of radiation is bad for you. But so are micro plastics, goyslop, and not exercising.

The only legitimate objection I think is not nuclear power itself, but that in Western countries, nuclear plants will hire retarded niggers because of DEI policies. That's legitimately worrying but that's an argument against those policies, not against nuclear power.

They will not openly genocide them. There are far less obvious and more cost effective ways. What they will do is simply displace them through land ownership. The Chinese will just keep moving in, buying up, breeding up, and in the process keep pushing the natives out. There may not be any overt exclusion to the Africans, like formal segregation or Apartheid laws, there just will not be anywhere for them to live within the Chinese owned and controlled areas. No jobs. No government handouts, no DEI laws. No "reservations". Just a continuous "squeezing out" procedure practiced over generations. This has been the standard Han Chinese operating procedure for the past 4000 years. Its not even a conscious strategy, its just what they do naturally.
Now if crisis points are reached on the outside the Chinese will support one faction against another and let the Africans kills themselves, supplying all the arms they need. Once this settles down the outward push begins again.
This is how the Han Chinese took over China. Just unyielding constant pressure, like an elephant very slowly rolling over in bed, pushing everyone else out.

Taylor, I hate to be that guy but heck, I am that guy.

I was in same spot once when I was younger and psyopsed by all the crap out there. Lo and behold (it’s a long story, maybe I’ll share it someday in a better setting) I came to realize what opponents of bolsheviks and pol pot realized as wel, except it was too late for them.

The extremists never stop being extremists, and will only become more ruthless and radicalized when they actually seize real power. Meaning all the helping hands and outside primary group elements that helped that are the first to be executed for being to smart, intelligent, successful, or even wealthy.

So on your case, if Obama rev 2.0 ever comes around, you will be the first ones to be eliminated and crushed by the real Black POC DEI campaign, no matter what you do. They’ll sue you and your family to death with the feds and state court systems (have you seen how the law is backwards against trump, there’s no legal system to protect anyone who isn’t with them) and then they’ll kill you, your kids, and your entire family. You’ll be disappeared in every sense of the word.

They’ll never see you as an ally. You’re already an enemy to them. Better wake up and start acting like one too, because it’s Game of Thrones already. ~13

I have no doubt someone from your senpai leaked some info on me. My sincere thanks from me and my Co for keeping quiet about it all.

Same with Biden admin, the real people (well some of them are people) hate you.

I don’t really have problems with women in gyms. There’s a few that are annoying but nothing too bad. There is some fag that has bad gym etiquette though. He’ll sit at the lat pull down for 5 minutes while staring at his phone. Then he does a couple reps and repeats. I’m actually working pretty hard to cut so I’ll be in there for a few hours. This guy will be in as long as me and do as much in 3 hours that I do in 10 minutes. But back the question…Women don’t belong in the military. No one belongs in the military, but if the military wasn’t fake and gay they definitely shouldn’t be there unless they’re working in administration or medical. Women shouldn’t be pastors or preachers. I’m not Christian, but still… fuck no. Girls don’t belong in Boy Scouts. There’s too many female pilots. Some women are perfectly fine. But there’s a lot that slip through the cracks because they’re cute. That and they get hired with lower flight time requirements than men for DEI. Women can be cops but shouldn’t be on the frontlines. They should be available to deal with female issues/suspects. Honestly…women don’t belong in sports past high school. I don’t even like sports ball. But it’s fucking retarded. If you’re going to waste time watching a game don’t entertain the idea that inferior athletes deserve as much attention as players substantially faster and stronger. Women are better than men at gymnastics and figure skating. They can have those. Male gymnast get a pass but male figure skaters go in the pit.

Correct. If you want to cause birthrates in a country to plummet only two ingredients are necessary.
1. Increase quality and access of healthcare.
2. Give women education.
Number 2 is also strongly correlated with improvements in women's rights. Women getting educated means they enter the workforce, and this has downstream consequences all around.
1. Focus on careers means less focus on building a family, and the more educated a woman gets, the fewer children she will have.
2. She now competes with men for jobs, something exacerbated by policies such as affirmative action and DEI. This doubling of the labor force has been a reason (though not the only one) why wages have stagnated.
3. It reduces the quality of our education. This is not something most consider, but in the past, one of the few only acceptable occupations for a woman was teacher. Which meant the smart women of the past had little choice other than be a teacher or be a homemaker. This meant that children got a higher quality of education, as they had a higher quality of teacher. Women gifted more options means that many of them choose not to be teachers, and it has been a slow decline of our education system since.

I know plenty of people in flagship engineering programs in this shitty country and they are all (except a few) idiotic useless retarded hylics. I can count on my fingers who are actually competent. The truth is that midwits, normies, and NPCs were never supposed to have gone to college, and if they do go, they only get surface-level understanding out of their studies. And of course, all the fucking cheating that goes on is insane. I can't imagine what it is like in lesser engineering programs. The STEM meme, DEI meme, ESG meme pushed millions of useless eaters into getting worthless degrees. Still, if you are worthy, you should go to college. But, undergraduate degrees don't mean anything now. The only way to signal to potential employers that you are at least semi-competent is by getting a master's or PhD degree or having some interesting thing on the resume.

Listen up shitskin, there is a 100% shift happening. Non-whites know they are trash and that is why they chimp out and throw garbage everywhere. They cannot handle the old societal norm hoisted on them and as they replace it with theirs the society decays. The DEI stuff is not working. It is a thin veneer. Whites in a majority minority America will gain a racial consciousness and they will still be the largest number, have the wealth, and the superior genetics. The only group that may make it will be East Asians and mostly white hispanics. The Jews see what is happening too but they are destroyers by nature and will be caught in the middle without anyone liking them unless they capitulate. Good luck to them. The aztecas and negroids and dalits and mongrels literally smell and in an ever increasing competitive market with AI they will not be allowed to survive once the egalitarian lie is exposed and the more dark it gets the clearer the lie is shown. Any majority minority area is a shithole, any place less than 70% white turns into a ghetto even if incomes are higher than national average. Show me a “good” majority minority suburb or neighborhood, you may find that possibly East Asian but as I said they will be potential ally. The future will be a mixed shade of light with 100 iq entry point. No one wants a 70 iq voter telling them their kids deserve to be raped and killed. There will be a point that looking like those kids gets you chosen as leader.

Uh no. We already spend $2trillion OVER what we take in via taxation. You can't tax people more when they DON'T have any more money. The US national debt is rising at $1 trillion every 100 days according to Bank of America. There's MASSIVE inflation in the US because of all of the money printed. Therefor it also takes more money to buy the same amount of munitions than what it took before.

On top of all that lets say the old US munitions are getting depleted and replaced with new ones. Do you expect those new munitions that were built with DEI mutt hands to work correctly at all? We have Boeings falling out of the sky over here daily. Do you expect those very same diversity hires to now make a fucking cruise missile that finds the target correctly?

I'd take the old munitions made by white hands.

Exceptionalism always wins in the end, as it is happily subject to reality. This fake and gay shit only lasts so long and only within certain parameters and under specific conditions. I know it sounds cliche, but this DEI, using the strong to prop up the weak bullshit DOES have an expiration date. The whole "Weak men create hard times etc" shit is a thing for a reason. I know it doesn't seem like it sometimes, but eventually society and civilization are going to reach a terminal point where there's more completely incompetent people in charge of things than there are competent (were probably already there) and the wheels are going to start falling off. Once that happens, people are going to want full bellies and to be able to go outside without worrying about being robbed, raped, and murdered by a pack of shitskins. Once that day comes, I think you'll find people will suddenly get alot less concerned about what color the pilot is or how they are mispronouning someone. They're just going to want to eat and be safe and there's in reality only certain people who can grow food and keep people safe. Reality always wins

Based. I was forced to go to a re-education holiday from corporate where i was brainwashed with DEI bullshit. i refused to go at first but was told if i do not go i will not have my contract renewed...

So i went, I bought several jars of pickled jalapenos and a lot of different cheeses (i am lactose intolerant and jalapenos do something to my stomach that causes biological weapon grade gas to start forming.

I went to those seminars i was forced to go to and let out many silent but deadly farts into the room over and over... causing people to visibly gag and feel sick.

later i blamed it on the Indian guy cos we all say him smashing a curry before we went in.

Also have a story about going to an Indian wedding, eating everything i was not supposed to and letting loose my biological warfare on the dance-floor. actually cleared it. everyone started laughing and most people went outside. this was another silent but deadly that cleared a dance-floor. Again there were so many people to blame it on that no one suspected me..

Yep. Women like to cause fights and discord among men, they don't care about men's struggles at all in fact they enjoy it. They just want to wait at the finish line and fuck the winner. The worst part is that blacks haven't accomplished anything on their own, so they're not even victors in any legitimate sense of the word, they're only perceived to be victors because they are relentlessly propped up by jews (financially with affirmative action and dei, socially by being all over media 24/7, and legally as a protected class). But that's all it takes for most white women, apparently. Just the perception of victory with the thinnest veneer and boom, spread those legs for the victorious tribe!

It doesn't matter that this funding still has to go through the Senate, and be signed into law. It doesn't matter that it will take 3 months for the first American equipment to arrive in Ukraine and 5 months for the last of it. And clearly the DEI-caused mistakes at Boeing are only affecting civilian aircraft and every single piece of Boeing equipment supplied will work.

This is what's happening right now.
The fact that they turned against the jews was unexpected.
Every jew in my country (one of the biggest masonic/jewish country in west europe) is freaking out about the far left party called "france insoumise"... despite those country being created by jews.
Now there's not a single jew left in those parties.

Evola, invece, fu sin da giovanissimo impegnato a tradurre in azione concreta, e impersonale aggiungeremmo, i suoi sforzi culturali e di studio, avvalendosi in momenti diversi di collaboratori e strumenti diversi: dalla fase magico-realizzativa di Ur-Krur a quella decisamente “polemica” de La Torre, passando per la docenza presso la Scuola di Mistica Fascista o quella “razzista” e ufficializzata da Mussolini in persona e tante, tante altre ancora. Fino alle relazioni, le conferenze, i contatti con la Germania ed i tanti Paesi europei della Mitelleuropa ed Orientale, tanto con gli esponenti della Rivoluzione Conservatrice quanto con gli esponenti politici più illuminati e “in ordine” dei movimenti nazionali di allora: Codreanu e la Guardia di Ferro o gli ambienti germanici dell’SD, per esempio. Con la Germania hitleriana, in particolare, il già noto rapporto con gli ambienti tedeschi più sensibili (leggasi SS e dintorni) fu di stima ma, anche di diffidenza epperò fondati su di una fiducia quasi incondizionata verso Evola che nei convulsi giorni di Settembre del 1943, e dopo, fu stretto collaboratore degli ambienti più segreti facenti capo a Berlino.

Più che di un libro di rivelazioni o sensazionalistico, si tratta di un lavoro di tessitura e ricostruzione d’un mosaico sconnesso, con molte tessere a tutt’oggi mancanti. L’esito è stato un quadro decisamente più organico e temporalmente chiaro, che ha permesso di ricostruire movimenti, incontri e relazioni che fino ad oggi erano isolate fra loro e non organicamente comprese. Ma, soprattutto, di mettere un punto circa la collaborazione di Evola col nascente regime repubblicano (Rsi) e la Germania hitleriana. Infatti, quello che potrebbe sembrare, a prima vista, solo un lavoro compilativo assume un senso ulteriore nel dare finalmente una chiara ed inequivocabile collocazione e dignità nel ruolo di Evola con alte gerarchie italiane e tedesche fra il 1943 ed il 1945. Oltre agli eventi più noti, come la permanenza di Evola al Quartier generale di Hitler che attende Mussolini appena liberato dai tedeschi, de Turris chiarisce con dovizia di particolari altri eventi di cui si sapeva oggi molto poco: la missione a Napoliper tentare di salvare l’archivio segreto dell’amico Giovanni Preziosi, la collaborazione strutturata e ufficiale con l’SD tedesco come“consigliere ideologico”, i dossier informativi sulla “spia” Evola (degli Alleati e dei partigiani) e la rocambolesca fuga dagli agenti segreti Alleati accorsi per arrestarlo. In particolare, viene ricostruito il tentativo evoliano di costituire – sin dalla reggenza di Badoglio, con cui mai collaborò – un progetto politico di vera Destra (Movimento per la Rinascita d’Italia) che proseguì, nel suo peregrinare poi fra Austria e Germania, in una dimensione sempre più europea.

The place I work for is starting to hire Zoomers. They’re a trial to work with, but they’re a product of our backwards education system. Their language skills are poor. That’s not their fault. But as more onboard the office culture shifts to micromanaging. They are their worst enemies. Rather than direct their energies toward productivity they fuss and spin their wheels instead working very hard on minutia bullshit like “naming conventions” for files, wanting to form little committees dedicated to editing, or DEI, or moral. Then they cry or request mental health days whenever somebody points out an error. They claim they’re the ones being micromanaged, or overworked, or disrespected, whatever. I don’t think its fair to pick on people because of their age. And trust me, I’m not. The problem is their educations have set them up for failure. They’re barely competent, they worry and they cry. This is all the fault of their educations they’re all in debt over.

You faggots know this was a high IQ move right?
Cali has some discrimination law that outright lists like 100 different things you can discriminate against, which is politically speaking taken to mean "you can't discriminate according to anything ever" - even beyond the original 100. Specifically including politically related speech.

There is also legal precedent in the case of Google where the open question was "why aren't we hiring more female coders" and dude wrote a memo saying "because per capita more men like comp sci than women like comp sci". So the DEI dept fires the shit out of him same-day, he sues google according to Cali law, some huge settlement was granted but kept private as to the amount.

So these guys, likely knowing of this law and this history, make this high IQ move. It's like if you're making 9 kazillion per year salary at google, but are totally burnt out, how do you keep making that money without working? You pull this shit, get fired for political reasons, and now sue the fuck out of google. Congratulations, you have more than enough money to rentire in Bali now.

Easy fix. Just have boy schools and girl schools. Male educators and a male tailored curriculum in one vs female educators and the current wack ass curriculum in the other.
See what happens.
I went to a boys' grammar school. I learned a lot despite my almost total lack of interest in schooling. The best teachers were old school 'long for the caning days' blokes who still went for a pint at lunch but there were some decent old school dragoness women teachers too.
Nowadays I'd bet that even at a boys' grammar the curriculum is chock full of total DEI nonsense. Surprised they're even allowed to remain segregated based on gender.

Why are boys failing? This is a huge a mystery as antartica and recent mass deaths. Perhaps we may never know.

Actually, I remember at Uni being subject to insults from women vis my intelligence. In hindsight, it was partly coz I was cute (and still am). Also partly because I was not a good talker, though I'm better now. But really, the education system is part of this as well. I'm a reasonably intelligent fellow, but school simply bored me. I think this is a common poltard tale. I also wound up getting a better grade at Uni than almost all of those chicks, so whatever. And I defo turned one of them down for thesex, though I regret that one! Kek. I'm a retard after all.

Pretty crazy seeing that his paintings then just to get INTO school are better than a graduated art student today... I think he was rejected because it was during the Weimar Republic and jews were in control of all legislation, school, government, media, and money, which made everything shit, huh... kinda like today. I think they were basically doing DEI then, letting in unqualified jews into the art programs, taking a slot away from someone like Adolf, or due to lack of funding through hyperinflation, also jews, they could not afford to let someone in that was talented. Just being able to paint like that is cool, with the proper training, and perspective he could've learned in gee idk... school... he would've been an even better painter.

But he was needed for something else.

>>Enforcement can be an effective measure to reduce crashes and improve traffic safety. However,
the relationship between BIPOC communities and law enforcement is frayed, with many BIPOC communities questioning the motives and actions of law enforcement. Therefore, traffic enforcement programs should only be implemented or altered with extensive engagement with the local BIPOC community to consider if and how an equitable traffic enforcement program can be implemented in their community.

That means there were no black characters, woman exist to mend clothes rather than fight, and NPCs used phrases like, "Jesus Christ be praised."

It's one of the few modern games from a larger studio that values gameplay and experience over DEI and politics.

Again, you don't need to vote for Trump this November because it's all rigged and your vote doesn't matter. Also, I heard participating in Democracy is "Woke" so best to steer clear.

I’m sure you’re all seeing what’s going on with Boeing. Well that’s not just happening with Boeing, it’s happening everywhere. For example We make industrial equipment. Mainly tractors. I’m middle management so I don’t have all the info but I’ve got some. The quality issues are really getting out of control. Harnesses missing wires, vitally important pieces not being manufactured correctly, error codes with no logical explanations, things failing faster than they should. I know a lot of you are quick to blame DEI, and while it’s certainly an aspect, the issue is more so the botched pandemic response, shutting down the country irreversibly fucked up the supply chain to a point where it may never recover, coupled with a population that got used to not working/not working at their original capacity for years. There’s no QC anymore, and companies are scrambling to try and pretend like things are normal. For as much hate as the “upper class” gets, they’re doing their best to keep us working and not completely shut everything down so we can at least all have jobs as long as possible.

Keep an eye out for companies that suddenly “move to Texas,” think about what country borders them. Mexico manufactures a lot of parts for the US. Companies are doing this in the hopes that it alleviates some of these issues, if the quality is bad at least they can hop over the border versus having to days weeks or even months to get things re-manufactured and shipped all over the country. The final step would to just suck it up and move everything overseas

Yes. Energy returned on energy invested is a potential problem and there's no guarantee technology will keep the supply in line with demand, especially with the DEI infestation. As soon as oil costs more than 1 barrel per barrel, oil becomes useless for energy, though it might still be worth it for plastics or something.

Then the Jews wonder why no one wants to join the military or build this shit up or give them hope and change like their sissy faggot kids demanded that you use their pronouns and love black dicks.

All those are the short-term and less consequential effects of daft compliance. Obviously, out of the masses only a few will be the case, but we can imagine some men to be completely in their element within the military, all the while holding on to their anit-system beliefs. Imagine, the once mindless rabble of men that hate the system, now suddenly being introduced to military hierarchy, organization, and having access to military equipment and resources. Placing incompetent DEI officers in charge will only lead to friendly fire. Placing only those competent and loyal to the system in charge will be almost impossible as indoctrination and selection gets outpaced by demand for more men power.

We must also account for the chaos of war, which provides inherent protection against the system's attempts to only keep its loyalists in charge in officer positions. All it takes is one maker of leaders, and then soon dozens of leaders will be followed by hundreds of thousands.

We have seen this historically as well. In many instances successful revolutions and changes of power are lead by those that were trained and organized by the very powers which were later overthrown.

I am just amazed at how all the talk these days has been about draft non-compliance, when the thing the system should fear the absolute most is mass draft compliance.

Granted, the vast majority will be too stupid, weak, and already too deeply indoctrinated to do anything but follow the system's orders if drafted. However, it never takes more than one match to light a powder keg. All it would take is one single man to stir up the easily led masses against the system. Putting this man within the military hierarchy and circle of trust and honor that's above the system's control would only hasten it.

"Do what I say and fight my wars."
"Hand me the gun and I'll go fight your wars."
"Here's a gun, now go fight my wars."
"No. I won't fight your wars. I have the gun now. I'm going to fight you."

All the discourse these days has been about how the modern generation of western men will not comply with the draft and that'll be the worst thing ever to happen to the system.
But I don't really think anyone has thought about the grave consequences that draft compliance will have on the system.
In immediate terms, we can expect fragging (friendly fire against DEI officers, commissars, etc) misuse of military equipment, or outright non-violent protest in the form of simple inaction. This has already happened before in such low-morale and unsupported conflicts such as Vietnam and Korea. Even in the middle eastern wars fueled by feelings of 911, many inefficiencies were present. Even if the disgruntled drafted men aren't just shooting the system's officers or rolling live grenades into their tents, they can also wreck havoc on the system by simply not doing their jobs. Either just not charging into machine gun fire or not going over the trenches, or just smoking weed and selling their weapons and uniforms to buy more weed, non-violet noncompliance will waste away the system's resources. And we can expect this to be especially abundant not simply due to modern generation of men's lack of support for the system, but because they just don't want to fight and want more than anything to eat cereal, smoke weed, and watch Rick and Morty.

You can use Marxism to do it and make self-professed Marxists seethe.
According to Marx we have various classes and some which are in control of things. In his original analysis the bourgeoisie made deals with the aristocracy to make them wealthier, and in the end became the controlling class, and this was the natural endpoint.

What Marx didn't know or notice at the time was the rise of the professional-managerial class. In the US in the 30s this class made up less than 1% of employees. Today it's over 35%. They made deals with the bourgeois capitalists to make them wealthier, and in the end have become the controlling class. Who do you think really runs the boardrooms and pushes for DEI?

Now back to Soviet Communism. They got rid of their aristocrats and capitalists directly. What class came to fill the power vacuum? The proletariat? The USSR's own professional managers and administrators are the ones who ended up in control of the place. In the end they had Brezhnevism and hypernormalization. We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us. Then collapse.

To be more clear in both cases you end up with the same class in control with the same class interests. If international communism had spread the same way central bank capitalism did they would have had their own equivalents of the IMF fucking things up too.

Recently Games Workshop, the company that invented Warhammer, shamelessly retconned an Imperium/Human Mini-Faction called the Custodes (personal elite quarter-godlike guardians of The Emperor) from being a Brotherhood into having females. For multiple editions and books, the lore explicitly stated they were male-only. Over Twitter, GW blatantly shamelessly gaslit "There have always been female Custodes.". Further digging and research has shown they did this because Blackrock, masters of DEI (Didn't Earn It), own 8-11% if the GW Shares. Also Amazon is working on a Warhammer Series and they wanted female Custodes.

Within the lore of this little web-comic, the "female Custodes" is really a power Tzeentch demon in disguise. Tzeentch is one of the 4 (Evil) Major Chaos Gods and, among other things, he is the Chaos God of Manipulation/change (to put it simply and generally). Deceit, treachery, and manipulation fall under his domain. The reveal at the end is that normal human wasn't affected by her demonic powers and knows that there shouldn't be any female Custodes - so she's gonna do away with him.

Collagen, Q10, Cod Liver oil, Creatine (20g per day, for 7 days, then 3.5g to maintain - this is the loading dose you'll find in all fitness science papers), get atleast 1g/protein per kg of muscle per day, use a body scale that can scan for you. EAA (Essential Amino Acids) - can buy a tub of these in any fitness store.

For all supplements, always, and I do mean ALWAYS, check if the company has any jews in prominent positions - you wan't good products made by white people, preferably northern european whites, if the company has a DEI section on their website, find another.

Get the good stuff.

It's a bit extreme, but he's not wrong. It's definitely heading in that direction, and there is plenty of historical evidence for persecution like he describes.

We're already at the stage where we have to endure DEI indoctrination at work. And whites are excluded from work whenever possible. Now talk of reparations. It's all headed in one direction, and it's not good for white people in the US.

Hopefully, some reasonably successful country will become a haven for white people, but it's not going to be the US, UK, or Australia. Probably some eastern european country.

Yeah I support it. I’m almost full-blooded Anglo, with a familial history of 300 years in the United States, and then Switzerland and Scotland before that.

I was a pro athlete, and now I work in STEM in research and development. Almost all of my colleagues are either white or Asianmen—until recently with DEI pushing in incompetent brown women.

Most of my closest friends are Asian-American. Two of them citizens of South Korea and China respectively.

I’ve noticed that we’re essentially the same. We both respect our elders, we both hold honor and our word in high regard—frankly, I’ve never had anyone have my back like my Asian friends aside from actual white men.

Moreover, unlike other races, who bring us down, Asians are good to white people, and I feel we reciprocate. My uncle has a Japanese wife, and lives in Japan. My friend from SK has a white wife. In both cases, they’re happily married and get along well, with women falling into traditional roles and men taking the lead.

So yeah, I consider Asians an ally at this point, and really our only ally beyond white hispanics.

Moreover, my father caught in the Vietnam war. He was poor growing up, victimized by black people. As an adult, Jews screwed him over when he was a cop and then a lawyer, multiple times—stealing $200K in his wages at one point. TL;DR—he was embittered against race mixing and other races.

However, despite fighting a war against the North Vietnamese, he likes and respects them. They literally shot him, and he befriended them after the war, hiring the son of a north Vietnamese veteran to be his investigator for instance.

And then, his favorite place in the world was Japan. He got to go there when he was recovering from his injuries. He appreciated that the Japanese police and doctors were kind to him, but were not kind to the African American soldiers (who had stolen his stuff, jumped his friends on the base, and faked injuries to get out of combat).

>They think telling other people what to do is actual work

Knowing what to do, who to employ, and telling employees what to do is actual work. There are too few people who can actually do those things, and far too many interfere with the process.

"Just do the thing, even though you are understaffed and you have to hire unqualified DEI retards" is why things are heading into the shitter. Rational people leave jobs (and the workforce) over shit like that.

"Do it right, or don't do it at all"

There seems to be two ways. One it to have trendy DEI attributes. Going to guess you don't have those. The other is to come in as a solid performer and then decay over time. Never blow anything up, just become a bit less and less useful. Over time, you'll be relied on less and less to get things done.
In places with stack ranking where they axe the bottom 10% each review, this will eventually get you laid off but at non-tech companies where middle managers never want to admit someone under their management turned to shit and doesn't want to risk losing headcount when you're let go and HR doesn't let them refill the role, it works great.

It's no coincidence Agile fags made a 'manifesto" and coined a bunch of bullshit words like "waterfall" only to lump any practice that is not agile-like into one bucket to make sheeple go "Whaooo that's not agile that is waterfall! We can't have that here!"

It's a commie-like scam like DEI. So that companies hire agile coaches and send their employees to agile training.

One thing that shows Agile is a sham is it's Point System. Every time my company did a round of agile training for it's engineers I would see the same question come up of "WTF are points" "What if I have a story that is not technically complex but requires a lot of manual effort." "Why the fuck can't I make points a time estimate scale?!" And the agile experts can't come up with a good explanation.

It's all a scam that corporations fall for and adopt and become even less efficient because devs spend more time in meetings than working. The irony is agile sold as something that will make large organizations "efficient like start ups".

So in other words, not happening. You DC faggots would have to create a US version of an amalgamation of the Spanish Legion and French Foreign Legion to get young men to join but y'all are too chicken shit to do it. Another avenue would be to revamp the rank system. Have less officers and put more power into the hands of senior enlisteds and warrants. Maybe have enlisteds go all the way to E10 and warrants to WO7. It would help with retention as the top pay goes to officers and that requires a bachelors degree. Officers should be rare and truly an elite cadre of personnel, not the equivalent of a middle manager at a Costco's. If you glownig thinktanks need an ideas man, y'all know where to hit me up.

Why can't space marines be female. I am sure the emperor could have created female space marines if he really wanted, but why would he? Its not like he had a shortage of people to experiment on. If you were going to make a super solider why would you use women? They are less strong by default and have less space inside them to work with because of the uterus. Their hips are designed for birthing and have to compromise on their ability to run. Also the process would likely have to be different for them than their male counter parts. Why would he bother when his only goal was to conquer the universe. He wasn't the emperor of DEI all he cared about was results. This whole thing tells you that they are deciding to make realism and their own lore as secondary things to more corporate agendas. Which I think is pretty dumb considering that the DEI stuff is losing popular sentiment and has backfired on the companies that implement it.

The people saying basic stuff like: "why do you care, it doesnt affect you" "does it matter, is it really so bad that more people can get included in the hobby"?

Its far more insideous than this. Custodes are the peak of human warriors. It was specificly chosen for that reason. Let me explain:

Evolution and genetics denial is the fundemental principle of dysgenic leftists and their ilk.

The denial of natural reality and nature is based primarily on the fact that most people on the left are physical rejects and dysgenics. They are mutants.

Putting females in combat roles is the first step on the path to denial of natural reality and evolution. Putting them above all other chapters as the best warriors in the galaxy is exactly that, denial of evolution and spitting on the male role in society. Everything a man can do, a woman can do equally as well.

It is proof that warhammer, despite insanely hostile gatekeeping from high spending whale white male gamers, is also subject to preassure from ideological subversion.

This move was done because vanguard and blackrock are major shareholders, additionally they are doing a amazon televisionshow. Amazon is notorious for pushing leftist DEI casting. More likely than not we will get a custodes style show featuring a diverse cast of ethnic males and female custodes.

Its an interesting turning point, games workshop basically has calculated that they believe they will gain more revenue from catering to mass markets than from continuing milking a hardcore dedicated primarily white male audience. Or at the very least those white males wont drop off in sufficient enough numbers to outweigh the potential new customers.

This is usually the beginning of the end for most hobbies, but especially hobbies that are right-male leaning. Companies that cater to mass markets usually lose their core audience in the process because the product has to change in order to be approved ideologically for mass consumption.

>Niggers consume pushed media, products, propaganda and goyslop more than other races except for boomers.
High reception to conditioning, low impulse control, and neurotic need to display material possessions as compensation for severe insecurity are hallmarks of the African-American population in the United States. They are perfect consumers, limited only by a relative lack of wealth; a drawback which DEI has made strides to mitigate, with the understanding that the ruling capital class will reap a significant portion of those monies.

TSMC is trying to migrate it's less advanced chips over, but it's not been easy. Ironically U.S. would be in a much better spot if the ruling class just came out and said no more bs this is a dictatorship until we get these chips sorted. but that might be untenable to the idiot populace.

we can do a war with anyone without going nuclear, Russia and China would only use nukes if they're losing or we use nukes first and they're not going to lose and I don't think we'll use nukes first
we can't do a war with China or Iran because we can't sustain those wars because we have no land access to these countries so these would be missile wars, and Chinese/Iranian missiles make sea supply too costly or impossible

fighting Russia is our only option because we can establish a front somewhere in Europe and feed almost 2 billion mutts and europoids into it
and while DEI is a problem, they will drop that shit to promote the war and the real problem will be a lack of industry which is a result of the rentier class destroying western industry by increasing the price of everything for their own personal profits thereby making it too expensive (read, lack of resources) to get anything done

It's a great system if you have the money to use and abuse it. Poor people do have a Constitution, but never enforce it so they have nothing to complain about. They can kill a plane full of people, poison an entire community, dump chemicals into the air, and nothing happens as long as they can pay the fine or class action lawsuits. And if it's cheaper to do that, they'll just do it because you allow your representatives to handle these situations in that way.

Are we really playing the 'misogyny' card? She was some feminist power fantasy inserted JUST for the act of a woman telling the emperor 'no'. That's it. It's time for people to actually mature and realize that emasculating male characters just to achieve some kind of dei/esg score/social justice brownie points is not some anyone anyone who actually likes the hobby and lore would ever do.
And if we're pretending gw and dan wrote her in for any other reason then you're just being ficticious and there's no reason to even engage with you. As much as that shit gets push in every bit of media that gets even a little popular, you'd think one could come up with something more than
>waaaah they just hates womens
No bitch, you are just a weak person. Okay with men being made a fool of, while thinking you're some kind of 'enlighted' being for blindly sticking up for anything involving a woman. Even with something clearly written by some dude that's already had this issue with past female characters.

Grow the fuck up. If you don't care about men being given a raw deal, then don't bitch when people don't accept the 'next' Rey Skywalker.
>Her image is demonized
No it's not. Her whole existence is for the one purpose of telling big e, he might not have known the best thing to do. And in the end, with her finally figuring out chaos, it's her who is actually the one proven to maybe not know what the best thing to do is. But it took throwing 20 of her fucking children into the warp. So many consider her to be a dick. And an idiot. While the lore tries to paint her as 'good' and 'wise'.
