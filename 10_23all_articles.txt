I fucking hate computer science people so much. They talk in nebulous nonsense terms hoping to confuse people from the fact they can't explain what the fuck they actually do. This girl when asked what she does can only muster out, "Uh, I do like data entry for animal research?!? It's like backend stuff kinda?!? I don't know how to explain it lol". My sister's boyfriend also does "IT support for government projects involving contractors" and five attempts later I still have no fucking clue what that means and he can't gleam the concept of providing an example. Elon firing 75% of Twitter really solidified my belief that we have a MAJOR political problem with bullshit white collar jobs for nepotism hires and DEI. Then actual smart White guys like me have to do all the work. It's really making me seethe.

The papal system sits on the throne of the dragon (pagan Rome) and leads the widow-church whore of Babylon. He professes to be the substitute for Christ on earth, and the number of his name (Roman numeric value of vicarivs filii dei) comes together as 666.
It really baffles the mind how anyone can seriously defend the papal beast with all its abominable doctrines and witchcraft and paganism and blasphemy and jewry, and then still turn around accusing someone else as being jewish or this that and the other. You defend and worship this abomination because you have his name and the number of his name in your forehead (mind) and on your right hand (your actions).

Revelation 18:1-8
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

The DEI people are fucking stupid.
There's a recent trend that people have been discussing of making characters in games/movies/shows/comics deliberately unattractive in an attempt to be "inclusive", but they only ever do the same overweight problem glasses look because that's what the DEI writers look like and they can only think of themselves.

I'm a white male and I could do what they are claiming to do while also not being a pandering fuck.
Like make a female lead who is conventionally attractive but has scars from having a cleft lip.
I don't have one, but it affects ~1 in every 700 people in the US and it leaves lifelong scars that people often end up having complexes about.

Did you read the article OP's pic related comes from? Your situation is exactly that, to a t. Makes me think this is, in fact, a widespread problem. I've described how "institutional inertia" is what keeps the U.S. military moving forward despite recent DEI, but if it continues it will eat away at said inertia until the system slowly comes to a stop and collapses. Looks like the same is true for public utilities, industry, etc.

America is already experiencing a "crisis of competency." Our country, which through the labors of our ancestors and God's own will became the greatest power the world has ever known, has become a complex system of systems, systems vulnerable to collapse if we cannot provided competent operators to keep it functioning. Already we see signs of failure, much of it due to DEI, but I would argue equally do to other forms of social and moral corruption (zoomers were hooked on internet goyslop from birth, they had no chance). Expect calls for "meritocracy" to be branded racist in the media, and quite likely the phrase "competency crisis" as well.

Then you can stop letting blackrock vanguard etc destroy the housing market

Tax incentives to start a family, no more retarded dei shit, stop allowing communists and the dsa to run wild, prosecute people who suck off the chinese like newsom.

Encourage women to have families not to work and be miserable.

Stop fucking up our international image by getting involved in foreign wars and border disputes.

the real problem with india is the consistency. i've worked with turbo smart guys, normal guys that generally knew what they were doing, and complete dipshits that could barely log in to their machines. the problem is, you can't tell what you're getting unless you know how to interview properly. you might see a well spoken brahmin dude with good social skills and an upper class accent, but ultimately doesn't know shit because he decided that taking tests was below his caste, so he paid some darker guy to do it for him. likewise, you might run into a skittish dalit dude who busted ass and learned to be good at everything so he could break out of the shit he was born into. but the only way to know is to interview properly which far too many people can't (dumbasses that don't know either) on won't (dei commie faggots).

I work at a large complex public utility company. The situation is quite bad. We have replaced experienced white males with women. We are coasting on our decades of inertia. The way it is currently working is these highly paid work at home. women have experienced white men under them who are actually running the show more or less. However, these experience white males are systematically leaving either through retirement or by quitting. Most men have silent quit and just play along. We have formally gone full DEI at this utility. No white men are being promoted whatsoever. I went with HR to do job recruiting at a university. Every woman and black that turned in their resume got a star scrolled on their resume. The white men got no star written on their resumes. Under women management we have made some huge tactical errors with our growing infrastructure. We are in violation of state and federal regulations. But we are contriving our reporting methodologies to deceive the regulators. We have created massive infrastructure that is deeply flawed and we are cheating to make it seem to be okay. A lot of smart, very hard working men created a large, highly advanced well run, well designed public utility and it is coasting down into destruction. Coming soon, we are looking at a third world style infrastructure of utilities that only half work half the time.

>VC jews attach diversity strings to investment capital, putting every major corp under their thumb to do what they say
>None of it turns a profit because niggers, but it doesn't matter with constant stream of "free" money since 2008
>Rapid expansion of the monetary supply in 2020 and 2021 causes massive inflation
>Central banking jews send interest rates to the moon practically overnight
>Suddenly nothing is profitable because it's based on DEI and not a solid business model
>Shit gets wrecked

This is what's coming soon because there are radical shortages in parts, equipment, capital, and competent labor:
>Long periods of utility downtime--routine power outages will start to last weeks or more; storms and disasters will wipe out areas for months
>Pipeline delivery downtime--parts/labor/capital shortages cause outages like what we saw with the Colonial ransomware attack, but they will last longer
>Fewer trucks on the road--shipping/distribution will get hit hard with drivers/truck part shortages
>If a major world war breaks out, it will give cover and exacerbate all of the above

And in this shortage/rationing "crisis" (totally manufactured), kikes will completely deprioritize red, white, rural areas and prioritize "population centers," effectively starving out their enemies. Just like they did in China, just like they did in the Soviet Union.

>The leader of Christianity
That guy sits on the throne of the dragon (pagan Rome) and leads the widow-church whore of Babylon. He professes to be the substitute for Christ on earth, and the number of his name (Roman numeric value of vicarivs filii dei) comes together as 666.

Revelation 18:1-8
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

This is in a liberal town full of leftist whitoid cucks, but they still refuse to buy niglet toys. Is this an indicator of nigger fatigue? What are the political implications of supposedly profit-driven corporations virtue-signalling themselves into real capital losses? Is this driven by ESG, DEI, or just kikes being kikes?

I see shit like this more and more, and it seems that normie psychological immune systems are rejecting jewish poison with greater frequency and intensity, from scenes like this to the general negative reaction to Israel's latest crimes, regular people seem more willing to reject heeb degeneracy every day. Is the fire rising or will the jews adjust and convince Cletus to go die for Israel after all?

>All parties (libs, cons, ndp, green) are pro oil, us, eu, war, israel, etc.
There can still be some differences within issues. Not enough to help Canadian discourse or Canada more generally, but enough to say they have something to fight over.

Like the Liberals, and to some extent the NDP, are more the party of Biggest Oil. Of Transnational Oil. These entities (BP, Shell, etc) have different interests than the smaller and medium-sized players also operating in Canada. They're on team DEI, team Green investing, and want the State to support major capital investments through programs explicitly targeting those investments. The medium players want things like more general reduction in regulatory burdens and red-tape and taxation.

Energy East would have been something of a nation-building program for Canada. Big Oil isn't that interested because it doesn't particularly benefit any of their existing facilities & markets. Neither are the smaller players interested beyond potential improvements to price that any pipeline could be said to gain for them, especially since they have no base in Quebec. The US's influence on any of these players would be in favour of killing a pipeline that would steal business from the usual marketplace of selling raw oil going down and buying refined gas coming up. And then if the Irvings aren't promised a juicy cut there's no real maritimes support to invest either. The carbon tax of course makes the business case worse when they get to import cheaply from the Saudis.

>women CHOOSE to end up alone rather than
thing is the government enforces at gunpoint that they have that choice.
And I'm not even talking about "hurr women shouldn't have rights and should be treated like property".
I'm talking about how most of those women who choose to end up alone "work" to make a living.
Except they aren't actually performing productive work. They are doing bullshit HR or middle management jobs that wouldn't exist without investors and supervisory boards (read kikes and good goyims) enforcing ESG (environmental social governance) or DEI (diversity equity & inclusion) indexi on companies.
In a materialistic production based economy, most of those women wouldn't even have the option to just stay single and not get a husband, not because they are legally forbidden from working and earning their own money to pay the bills, but because If they choose to work, they'd ACTUALLY have to work the jobs that men currently do.
Basically in the past women were allowed to work, there were no actual laws preventing them from working, a womans options in the past were:
>1) join uber-chads harem (only really hot women accepted, chad has to be selective as he actually has to provide the resources for those women all alone by himself)
>2) get a beta.-male provider husband
>3) do actual back-breaking menial work that men would usually do
>4) become a prostitute
>5) fucking starve to death
you can see why most women choose option 2)?
The current system allows women to be "married to the government" and the government provides the women with tax subsidies they collect at gunpoint from beta males.
Woman of their own without getting subsidized by beta males just aren't productive on average.

I think there are compounding causes.
- ESG/DEI initiatives
- Once low quality employees enter the workforce, they hire and push to hire other low quality employees. (Bozo Explosion) This happens with all races but I've seen much more of this, lately, from Indian/asian populations (Anecdote: They hired a female indian for a technical position that could not operate a computer, I mean wtf)

>There is enough money being pushed at these companies that they can disregard output and efficiency or any sort of team cohesion.

Myself and those I know have experienced this in tech and in insurance (management). I know these companies are pushing around a lot of cash. However, there HAS to be other incentives. DEI and affirmative action hires are huge wastes of budget and a major drain on time and resources.

Do you know if there are government incentives in the form of tax breaks and/or subsidies behind the implementation of DEI/AA hiring? I understand BlackRock and ESG scores but I don't think that applies in my case.

I think much of the minority hiring ultimately functions as a sort of welfare program, and maybe that is the intention. Giving them a job keeps them busy, gives them money to blow, makes them think they are "invested" in society. I'm not saying I agree with this at all, but I'm guessing that's their perspective.

I've now been a part of two companies which were not DEI when I started but became DEI companies within a few years.
>Company 1: the CEO stepped down and handpicked an affirmative action hire who then implemented DEI.
>Company 2 was literally all white until it was bought out/merged with a top 5 company in the field. That company is majorly DEI. Its on the front page of their website.

Both positions became considerably more difficult due to the unearned diversity hires who junked up the process with their incompetence. Also all that budget money being wasted and all those positions needing to be filled means less opportunity for me, other competent deserving candidates to get merited promotions and raises.

TLDR: There is no way this is successful without other incentives. Its just too damn wasteful and risky

I hate to break it to you but every company I've worked at since 2015/6 has been pushing this shit. People at salesforce would walk around with "Ally" shirts on to show how inclusive they were.

More ridiculously under-qualified hires than I've ever seen in my life.

There is enough money being pushed at these companies that they can disregard output and efficiency or any sort of team cohesion.

When/if the DEI/ESG money dries up there are going to be a LOT of shit workers in-place and they had better hope they're still making money via another method than Vanguard/Blackrock hot beef injections.

Meanwhile, these people are all making 180-350k/year with stock options and they're donating against your interest and buying homes in your area and sending their kids to your local schools.

If they are exposed as weak, and the USA is not in a position to be the imposing big brother we have always been, then they are in deep trouble. If a carrier was disabled/destroyed it would cast serious doubt on the USA's longstanding ability to wage war anywhere anytime. I am also concerned that the Military's focus on DEI instead of war fighting and catering to people who shouldn't be serving would dampen their ability to fight.

They did until they came in contact with those niggers and spics. A lot of retards like to say "New York has always been diverse" but this is not the case and certainly not the case in the last 50 years or so. While physically the citizens of New York might have been more "diverse" than many other cities in the country the truth is that New York was a monoculture and was heavily, extremely segregated. You go one block over and its an entirely different world with different rules. The "new arrivals" coming from the southern border haven't gotten the memo and so they stumble around disrupting order and creating chaos and violence everywhere they go and the citizens are pissed off.

Also New York is a place of money, a lot of niggers and spics are located in places like the Universities and Corporations that exist within New York City some or all of them are getting gibs to help the corporations reach their DEI targets but even they are purposely imported niggers and spics.

These niggers and spics coming from the southern border have no skills, are completely illiterate, have an IQ in the low 50s that they are incapable of learning even if you attempt to educate them, they are prone to violence. They do not respect local customs - in fact they spit on them and will rape your women on top of your favorite statue to <insert jewish philanthropist here>

If they controlled the West they'd tell kikes to fuck off, since kikery and DEI trash hurts their profits. Your worldview is nonsensical because they aren't motivated by money alone.

What's really absurd is seeing you reject order itself. The branches come off the tree trunk, the fruits and leaves hang off the branches. That's rightly ordered.

All this resulted in is turning fast food jobs into valuable careers, the same as a doctor's or firefighter's, which means there are ZERO FUCKING WAGESLAVE JOBS IN CA. Ever since we were ground zero for upped minimum wage, finding a job that isn't padding itself with Mexicans has been a nightmare as early as 2007, and DEI only made it even more impossible. The only positions fast food is looking for in my area are managers, because they all flood Linkedin, Labor Finders, Indeed, Craigslist, and others with apps to ensure fucking EVERYONE is applying and knows there's a fake "job shortage", but out of the hundreds applying, maybe 1-2 will get hired, or they won't hire anyone at all, who knows!

This is because upped minimum wage means you have to either have a skeleton crew that's constantly spreading themselves thin on terrible hours, or a giant staff spread thin on god-awful, Satanic, retarded hours, all so that high minimum wage doesn't cut into the budget, and you have good cattle that won't make this their "forever" job

You have to remember, that places like Google hired people to keep them from innovation or disruptive business that could endanger their business models.
See how many projects google have put in action and how they all were killed, it is no coincidence, work your good years for a globo corp. Lose your initiative, become a wagie dependent on an employee contract.
Many of the diversity hired were just that. Padding to fill out the stats, but when you have a downturn in the market (in this case ad spending) people are less interested in secondary characteristics of a company, but rather is it able to cut cost and increase profit margin. Even DEI initiatives have been criticized by big money bag investors like Black rock (who came up with it in the first place), that are reliant on pension funds to invest.

ok buddy, listen: you are young and probably stupid since you came to reddit to post such a thing. You are correct in your assumption that there is a problem with the DEI hiring but you, because of your age, have 0 idea that in practice, it is not a big deal if you do stuff that reddit will bann me for telling you but.... it is key to the mistery of how to beat all that crap: lie. This is all.

You are probably an idiot that wrote that he is a straight white male or some shit like that.... with age you will learn the true characteristics you should pick on your own but for now let me help you: straight is the bottom of the barrel and you need to pick atliest gay to be even considered, then again with the multiple nonbinary options you could pick you need not even go further here. If you are getting 0 offers go trans as this is the top of the category but .... nah. no need.

For race: white is the worst and while black and indian are in the middle I would suggest you just do your homework and pick the master option: jew. There are multiple jews that know little about their own nation and you can lie in their face about your jewish origins and as for other races, they either know a thing or 2 or will just accept you as a top of the victim pole race choice. You could also go for mexican... but that is just a low race pick and may be harder to explain your mexicannes.

That is all. You are a gay jew. From now on HR ladies will cream over you aznd you will get offers.

As for someone who will not cream over this post: it will be deleted quite fast and i will be banned, but then again, I have been banned from 109 subreddits so I just kind of got used to it.

And remember kid: for as long as you work hard and play only a little bit to the system, you will have an ok life. Do not get depressed because shit is not fair, just lie a little and it becomes fair.

Marry a hardworking minority woman. That’s what I did. I’m an above average white man from a middle class family, so I was basically doomed in this world. So naturally I sold my white beauty to a foreign woman who got into an Ivy League college here. I married her while she was still at her first job, just a few years later she started flying up the managerial ladder. She’ll probably be a VP by the time she’s 35, could even see her making CEO one day. I’m a few years younger than her, but can’t break out of menial clerical office work despite having a significantly higher IQ than her and being far more eloquent/socially intelligent. This society we live in today is a cheap mockery of what we had in the 50s.
This is clown world anon, no matter how hard you work you won’t be able to breakout of whatever class you’re in unless you can benefit from nepotism. Just do what you have to to survive.
I’d be homeless by now if I hadn’t gamed the system by exploiting romance to adjacently profit off of the retarded DEI bullshit. I quit my office grunt job a year ago, I was way too overqualified for it. Still don’t have a job, but it isn’t like it matters. Any income I can scrap up is insignificant when compared to my wife’s income. Just going to coast off of my good looks, and be a trophy husband until western civilization collapses. Hopefully I get to see this world go full Mad Max.

it's really simple - if you aren't going to be considered for promotion or pay raise because you are white then odds are you work in a DEI environment where it takes you actually murdering someone IRL to get fired from - so your mission is to do the bare minimum in that job, if it's a WFH job then get a second job with overlapping hours nad be terrible at both of them - they still won't fire you.

Also gaslight any managers or directors who are complicit with DEI. They come to you and ask "Do you think tyrone can handle that cutover on thursday?" give back simple as fuck responses with no details "I don't see why not, do you?" make him also approve of "No, he seems ready" force the manager into responsibility of the choice - feign ignorance to the failings of the DEI candidates at every turn - promote and encourage them to take complicated projects they can't complete "just ask if you need any help" then be completely unavailable when they need help "sorry stuck on this other project that is an emergency - can you ask Dave?" Dave is too unqualified to help him with this work tho... sucks.

Endless gaslighting and no work ethic - that is what you do anon- because when they thought they could pay me 10% more and I would do 300% more work they broke something fucking ANCIENT and i can't wait until they all burn now

This DEI might honestly be one the best things to happen to far right politics. Its forcing whites to band together(I've seen very left leaning whites border on 1488 talks thanks to DEI when talking one on one with them) and forcing smart whites to create new start ups that actually push industries forward.

Here DEI is not a thing...darkies are the majority of highschool dropouts and those who do get a degree are not as uppity as the american kind. They are trying to push women everywhere...with not exceeding success.
Keep in mind that pays are low here...and don't even consider major cities.

This is the only way to fight it. Unfortunately we live in a culture where having white skin is seen as a deep negative for no reason at all. I think everyone knows it, but they use bullshit justifications for it, treating their own country like a company town instead of a nation.

Then, after the November election, they'll claim its necessary to reinstate the draft. Only this time it'll be based on DEI guidelines for "equity" reasons.

Its the fault of Jews, truly. I am not even meme'ing here, if Jews had not been pushing cultural marxism and calling for the ''Abolishion of Whiteness'' then even the most extremist of NatSoc sympathizers here would be supporting and celebrating the success of Israel.

They only got themselves to blame for pushing ESG/DEI and having the ADL act like a Mafia.
So the real question, is Jews are truly Whites, then why do they keep creating golems to fight Whites, which inevitable turn against Jews?

Fake thread. Here is a theather between two Mossad employees: one (argentinian) claims freemasons are "based" and attempts to incite the reader into joining.
The other (swede), opposes that the argentinian, yet rejects the New Testament and tries to induce the reader that disagrees with freemasonry to follow suit.

Either way, you fall into the jewish trap. After all, freemasonry IS judaism fir the goyim at the lower levels, and is judaism itself at the higher ones. Whereas rejecting the New Testament is THE hallmark of jewish theology. Both of them are jews trying to trick the reader into losing their souls.

So I present something else:
Ave Maria, gratia plena

Benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui Iesus.
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,

Women do not have morals, ideals, or beliefs. Women basically do whatever the dominant male influence in their life tells them to. This is probably a result of evolutionary psychology, and can be observed in phenomena such as Stockholm Syndrome. When a rival tribe kills the men of a woman's tribe, those surviving women that exhibited rebellion against the outsiders were of no use to the conquerors and were killed. Those that submitted were integrated into the new tribe and passed on their genes. Women's desire to show deference to the wishes of the dominant men in their lives is as baked into their DNA as their physical dimorphism. They also have an intense desire to conform; especially White and East-Asian women. Women who failed to conform risked banishment from their clans. This was dangerous in any climate, but women who evolved in cold climates were especially vulnerable, effectively a death sentence. So again, those genes were selected for.

Most girls today are growing up in households without a father, or where their father is completely broken and cucked by divorce rape. They also probably subconsciously view their fathers as weak because almost no man can support a family on their single income, and mom had to work. Women have no nuclear family to rely on so they turn to the actual power brokers who control our society. It is clear to anyone with eyes and ears what social policies the government, corporations, and banks have been upholding as the dominant culture. Women feel an intense need to obey and conform, and the risk of banishment still exists for anyone who goes against the narrative prescribed by the powerful in the form of denial of banking services, firing from your job, etc. Thus they turn to DEI with the fervor of a religious zealot in complete reverence to power.

No longer will disgusting wypipo force children to learn to read, write, and do mathematics. The racist sciences of physics, biology, and chemistry, and the racist disciplines of history, civics, philosophy, and ethics, will be replaced with DEI trainings, holocaust class, hip-hop rap circles, and transgender storytimes.

I fucking can't stand it bros. If it weren't for my immediate coworkers and my cozy high paying position I'd be looking to get out now. How do other anons cope with working in environments where they'd be fired for even expressing a fraction of their power level?

NAACP = jews

BLM = jews
Refugee ships = jews
Open borders policy = jews
DEI = Larry Fink (jews)
Ukraine war = jews

These are the sort of people who truly keep White people down: not niggers, not jews, not women, but White men. The White men who defend the haters of White people. The White men who defend elite pedophiles. The White men who defend feminists in high positions that implement DEI initiatives that cut other White men off from the aid and sympathy and support of their own society. The White men who defend ZOG programming and propaganda. The White men that make it harder for other White people to live.
These are the faces of your pain, White man.

Okay, so the big lie is you can choose your degree to study and then choose your career path. But that's just the thing, it's a lie.
First you have the DEI clusterfuck of college admissions and which colleges you are admitted to is a toss-up for white people. Some colleges may not even have the program you're interested in or it would be so shitty it's pointless.
Then there's the actual "job market". L M A fucking O. You do not get to choose where you'd like to work. You send out hundreds or thousands of applications with a good GPA, internship, great extracurriculars, and MAYBE you get lucky and get an interview passed the HR screening roasties. By that point, personal choice is completely removed from the process. You're just a commodity swept up in an uncaring system, desperately selling yourself and monkeying the appearance of a good little goy worker so that you can get food and rent money to survive.

Its really not so complicated. It literally was a virtue signaling prisoner’s dilemma back when companies thought Twitter was real life. So they all started these DEI departments and are stuck with them because the costs/risk are less than the cost /risk of negative optics for being the singular company that pushes back.

Like remember how all the showrunners who had deals with streaming services for no logical reason started removing blackface joke episodes from their series’? And now it’s impossible to bring them back even though it makes not sense and was a purely superficial emotional reaction

The problem with DEI is it was never intended to be what it says it is. And the fact that it is academically-driven makes things even worse. Our colleges in this country are FUCKED. What was allowed to fester in the fine arts colleges spread to the liberal arts, so now they've managed to trickle their poison down into the public school system as their brainwashed education majors go to educate children. They've also spread their shit via the liberal arts throughout our legal system via "activist" judges and attorneys.

These people are not interested in equality. If they were, they'd call it equality. But they no longer use this word equality. They use the word EQUITY, which is a very different word. They use words like "intersectionality" and "inclusion." What they're doing is building an entirely different level of society that is comprised of a hopeless clash of gender identities, ethnic backgrounds, and other various forms of "victimhood." Within this society there will always be a caste system, infighting, and careful tip-toeing to not offend people and hope to be the chosen one. They just keep everybody squabbling then make sure their special little friend gets the posh job or position of power. When questioned, their special little friend who doesn't deserve to be there by merit or by good character is a black-female-lesbian-immigrant and how DARE you ask questions. Shit's fucked.

SAME. This is why I stopped being an ally to movements like BLM a long time ago, some people are hostile and subversive and use DEI as a mask to push LITERAL REVERSE RACISM BY BECOMING THE OPPRESSOR. It's honestly a tragedy the more academic people are being pushed out, Tabia Lee is someone I would call a decent person because she was CLEARLY MOTIVATED BY GOOD INTENTIONS AND SHOULD SERVE AS A POSITIVE ROLE MODEL TO OTHERS.

America can heal and come back from this, however it will take a long time.

the whole "muh importing migrants" won't solve their demographic and economic problems long term though. Foreigners can't integrate into Japan the same way they can with other countries since citizenship is dependent on blood and their work culture is dystopian. They're also a bunch of islands and they only have so much space for housing. Japan is too polite for them to even consider importing niggers or arabs. The average japanese salaryman would have a panic attack at the sight of jamal blasting nigger rap while robbing a gas station. It just doesn't work and they don't have the DEI brainwashing that western countries do, Japs hate most foreigners.

Because the diversity hire nets to company a .003% lower interest rate with the dei loan structure.
It also gives the government another "job" created because it was a new hire. The guy they run off doesn't count for unemployed until all the unemployment paperwork goes through, so 90+ days if the sheboons get off their asses. They are floating employment numbers like a check before electric transfers.

It isn’t some Chad masculine career where you’re doing intensive, world changing work. You’re more than likely an office or plant wagey, doing meaningless paperwork.

Telling active duty leadership about the draft and some other choice things is the best way to destroy the United States military and get everyone worth it to transfer over to a three letter agency while all the DEI trash gets genocided by Lancet swarms.

Hopefully the draft is mostly all non whites and the concept of a draft is enough to get most good leaders to quit immediately, all these holes are about to be filled in by DEI trash lmao.

that's the curse of taking individual responsibility for your success or failure and seeing the world through the lens of individualism. when there's open collusion between hedge funds and stock exchange governors, bankers, all forcing mandatory DEI standards, with regulators looking the other way. they just can't accept it because merit is supposed to overcome all these things. a system powerful enough to abandon meritocracy and still thrive is too terrifying to conceive of. so they desperately reach for simple explanations instead of the obvious truth of the most actively racist employment regime in centuries taking over their own countries.

and sending the exact same resume twice, once as a black man and once as me to see what happens.
But this could backfire hard and get me black listed, there aren't that many companies. They are large, but not many and they keep merging.

I don't think these companies want to do this DEI stuff, at least their high end leadership. But if they don't, they get major penalties on grants and research tax credits to the point where they will just hire 10 random black women because its cheaper than losing the tax credit.

If this DEI point systems ends tomorrow, I suspect a lot of layoffs.

I was in a seminar last week, ~70 people, and excluding the four 65+ year old white tenured professors, there were only two white men including me and a guy wearing a dress. If it was really about equity, there should have been at least 30 white men.

Diversity Equity and Inclusion awards points if you are not a white male.
Diversity points are critical for getting taxpayer grants or research credits, and every single R&D company applies for these grants/tax credits.
The point system is so bad that if you have a group of 5 black women and hire a white man, your diversity score goes down.

Princeps gloriosissime caelestis militiae, sancte Michaël Archangele, defende nos in praelio et colluctatione, quae nobis adversus principes et potestates, adversus mundi rectores tenebrarum harum, contra spiritualia nequitiae, in caelestibus. Veni in auxilium hominum, quos Deus creavit inexterminabiles, et ad imaginem similitudinis suae fecit, et a tyrannide diaboli emit pretio magno. Praeliare hodie cum beatorum Angelorum exercitu praelia Domini, sicut pugnasti contra ducem superbiae luciferum, et angelos ejus apostaticos: et non valuerunt, neque locus inventus est eorum amplius in coelo. Sed projectus est draco ille magnus, serpens antiquus, qui vocatur diabolus et satanas, qui seducit universum orbem; et projectus est in terram, et angeli ejus cum illo missi sunt.

En antiquus inimicus et homicida vehementer erectus est. Transfiguratus in angelum lucis, cum tota malignorum spirituum caterva late circuit et invadit terram, ut in ea deleat nomen Dei et Christi ejus, animasque ad aeternae gloriae coronam destinatas furetur, mactet ac perdat in sempiternum interitum. Virus nequitiae suae, tamquam flumen immundissimum, draco maleficus transfundit in homines depravatos mente et corruptos corde; spiritum mendacii, impietatis et blasphemiae; halitumque mortiferum luxuriae, vitiorum omnium et iniquitatum.

Ecclesiam, Agni immaculati sponsam, faverrrimi hostes repleverunt amaritudinibus, inebriarunt absinthio; ad omnia desiderabilia ejus impias miserunt manus. Ubi sedes beatissimi Petri et Cathedra veritatis ad lucem gentium constituta est, ibi thronum posuerunt abominationis et impietatis suae; ut percusso Pastore, et gregem disperdere valeant.

Adesto itaque, Dux invictissime, populo Dei contra irrumpentes spirituales nequitias, et fac victoriam. Te custodem et patronum sancta veneratur Ecclesia; te gloriatur defensore adversus terrestrium et infernorum nefarias potestates; tibi tradidit Dominus animas redemptorum in superna felicitate locandas.

I help run a large, national architecture and engineering firm. Calling it a "cost of doing business" is entirely accurate. We have clients (think most of the fortune 500) who demand to see things like DEI statements and hiring demographics. If we have an interview for a project we specifically make sure there are some women, blacks, and other minorities even though we all know older white guys are the ones who will do all of the work. We specifically seek out people who have ethnic sounding names on their resumes. It all makes me sick but we have no choice, if we didn't do it our clients would fire us.

Elon fired 80% of Twitter staff and the site remained functional, but you could fire 90% of the blacks and come out net-positive because the blacks that are productive would no longer be forced to interact with the ones that aren't.

Whenever you hear someone talking about how insurance companies are causing such high healthcare costs, remind them about DEI policies in the industry and cite how heavily healthcare as an industry conforms to them compared to other industries.

I've actually warmed up to corporations recently. My deep unerring hatred for corporate America has been properly rerouted toward Israel.
That said, I still don't like monopolies. But capitalism is more an inherent system with naturally occuring problems that I just want to tinker with if I had the time.

I actually helped terrify corporate America back in the day with blue check Twittertards. Twitter's single successful consumerist boycott had them reeling and they started all that DEI shit, which I knew even then was a terrible idea.
Since then, I've watched corporate America inflict DEI bullshit on themselves and started feeling a little sorry for them. They are kinda slow and oblivious in a lot of ways. But they keep chugging along. I just kind of want to tinker with it all.

I first discovered the curves 15+ years ago and over time eventually came to this conclusion : so fucking what? There is no black iq, Asian iq, white iq, there is only low IQ and high IQ. The whole point of “racism bad” is to allow the outliers to be liberated from their phenotype. Why be bigoted to the 1/1,000,000 genetic freak with the 150 IQ just because his melanin happens to be a little more concentrated, his nose a little fucked up?

I know this won’t win me any friends on /pol/ but the curves are just cope for middling whites with inferiority complexes. Leftists end up using them to conclude that “systemic racism” exists and they create DEI programs. We should unironically purge them from our shared knowledge because they do nobody any good. I’ve found the way people talk, walk and dress to be far better indicators to quickly gauge someone’s intelligence and civility anyways - and these things still tend to be racially correlated anyways. I’m a 135 IQ white manlet btw before you call me a nog.

"Corruption" isn't a concept that exists in every culture, that's because office is seen very differently across cultures.

Is "corruption" a crime by the office holder against the office, is it an offence against the state (a normal crime), is it an offence against higher office, an offence against the public, or against one's own charecter?

See in Asia, corruption means disloyalty. It means a crime against higher office. If glorious leader orders you to do it, you must do it. If glorious leader doesn't care that you do it, you're allowed to do it. Asians don't share our view of corruption.

Indians have a virtue society, but don't respect the natural order. Thus they see corruption as a bad habit or a personal vice. Thus in India abuse of office "for a good cause" is seen as a virtue. Indians don't share our values either.

Continental europeans and americans tend to see corruption as a legal offence. They're a legalistic society. Office holders must follow the law like everyone else. Thus they don't recognise office holders changing the law for personal benefit/ lobbying as corrupt.

Corruption as an offence against the public is dominant in Africa, synonymous with mobs. Gibmedats. Anyone the mob doesn't like us corrupt. You notice this feature of Elon Musk and other African leaders, they have a very open public presence and often ask the mob questions to uh... determine the law. Vox populus,vox dei.

The classical view that office is a duty to a higher being is now a minority view. The independence of office is now a minority view, the administration as an institution and administrative credo is now a minority view. The idea that an office holder can desecrate their own office is a minority view.
There are kinds of corruption only classical thinkers accept. Tyranny, impropperly holding multiple offices, disestablismentantianism, imperialism, these are concept only classical thinkers acknowledge. As western society declines we witness this daily

yes, it does, because they are the ones that even invented the idea that we should hate ourselves and give up things that we have for the poor nonwhites, and they are the ones that propagate it now, like bro you really expect me to think you're not shilling when blackrock is owned by a jew and invented and pushed DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion, globohomo in short) on the finance world which controls production which led to the massive wave of anti white propaganda beginning in the 2010s, and it's because our government sold out to them in the 2008 crash basically and they control trillions of dollars worth of assets as a result

if you can explain to me how blackrock, being run by larry fink and other jews, inventing DEI and then pushing it on the entire world is not a systematic jewish plot against white people then I will agree with your premise (you are not going to be able to do this any more than frankfurt school critical theory or the torat hamelech can be argued away but I'd love to see you try)

>But their politicians ignore the wishes of the majority. Is this the precious DEMOCRACY they always claim they are defending?

That's an interesting dichotomy, isn't it?

Educated urban elites, aka progressives, especially after the Capitol riot in the U.S, all of a sudden claimed the mantel of "democracy", being "defenders of democracy", you hear them say things like "our sacred democracy", etc, etc.

Notwithstanding the fact that the Capitol riots happened when Democrats were in charge of security and that they deliberately weakened security on that day (notice how they had literal barbed-wire around the Capitol building the next day)

But in reality they have contempt for actual democracy. The majority of people, especially in the U.S. are not progressives and in fact these urban elites would probably describe them as "right-wing". The majority are against things that these elites take for granted like gender-neutral school bathrooms, "anti-racism", DEI, on-demand abortions, etc.

It used to be that the majority of people were for things like racially segregated schools, banning gay sex, gay marriage, etc. Ending these things only came about because, ironically unelected judges ruled against them, not through electoral outcomes.

And it's an interesting canard too because when the majority favors something, these progressives deride it, you'll hear them say "they're voting against their own interests", "these deplorables are too stupid to vote", etc, etc.

A good example is voter id laws. Voter id laws exist to add trust to the electoral process, even if voter fraud isn't a huge problem. The majority of people are in favor of voter id laws, but progressives hate them, they call them Jim Crow 2.0. they want illegal immigrants to be able to vote, etc.

So clearly they actually hate democracy.

Competency crisis is right. I’m a public sector fag & recently left a job with a small town for more money/less commute in a medium-sized city. So much time is wasted at regular standing meetings (esp. Mondays and Tuesdays)—team meetings, all-hands meetings, project management meetings, etc. which all have overlapping information and discussions. On Mondays, I don’t get to do any real work because of all the fucking meetings. Plus, there’s the forced DEI stuff in our internal and external reporting and meaningless HR trainings, all mandatory. Plus, like any muni job, there are underqualified diversity hires and incompetent women who won’t ever get fired. It makes me wish I hadn’t left my last job, but there was no room to move up (9,000 person Town, less than 100 full time staff). Need to look at the private sector again in the next few months, or consulting, but there’s bullshit with those options too.

It is true that "Sol invictus" cult is directly related to what is now called "Christianity". It was brought into Rome by Carthaginian Severan dynasty. However, considering Christianity's love for passing live people through fire and general unhealthy obsession with human sacrifice, there is only one religion from which it could have descended.

However, Sol Invictus Allah Baal is definitely not Jesus, it's "Yahweh".

GENERAL THREAD ABOUT THE PARLAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN THE GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURG.


It's time again, lads. 5 years has passed and the small nationstate of Luxembourg elects a new Parlament and thus a new government.

Luxembourg had a three way coalition of Liberals, Greens and Socialists for 10 years now.
With the world going to shits and all, the Luxembourgish electors feel the pressure and this time, the campaigns were very messy.
It's not clear if the so called Gambia-coalition will get enough votes to continuenit's work. The conservatives (CSV) put all their hopes in Luc Frieden, an old acolyte of Jean-Claude Juncker. Can nostalgia decide the outcome?
Nobody knows. There were a lot of new small protest parties on the ballot this time and nobody knows how this will affect the outcome.

And of course, for /pol/, we will answer the question tonight if the rightwing, eurosceptic party ADR can gain some seats and especially how the extreme right party "déi Konservativ" will do, led by Joé Theini and his parents.

It's gonna get exciting. First polls are expected for 18h.

>According to Maestro Tobias da Magdeburg, many of the Jewish and German merchants who reached Venice in 1469 along with Friedrich III’s baggage train intended to supply themselves with the blood of Christian children for the Passover rite -- blood which Mavrogonato was said to have brought from Candia or Cyprus on that occasion. It does not appear that the Jews of that island had ever been accused of ritual murder at that time. Yet, Jewish Passovers at Candia in the mid-15th century were anything but tranquil affairs, and were often the source of scandal and clamorous indignation.
>During Passover week, 1451, the Jews of the ghetto of Candia were accused of crucifying suckling lambs (perhaps due to the impossibility of procuring Christian children), in contempt of the Christian religion, with a grotesque and sacrilegious anti-ritual. The symbolism of the suckling lamb placed on the cross seemed obviously linked, in an intolerable and obscenely blasphemous manner, to the passion of Christ, the Agnus Dei [Lamb of God]. The accusation does not appear to have been completely groundless, in view of the ancient Hebraic custom of roasting the Passover lamb skewered on the spit in a vertical position, with the head upwards, to ridicule and deride the crucified Christ.

Be sure to always point out that South Asians own more real estate than the English in London. Point out DEI hiring always especially when it comes to job posts explicitly referring to preferences for non-White male candidates for diversity reasons (like BAME-only graduate schemes). These facts seem to work their way on normie subconscious at the survival instinct level, they work. There is no progressive programming able to blind the normie to these facts.

The circumstance fallacy is even more potent for information dating back 50 years ago. In fact the most important information is the most recent and visible. As years pass, normies are waking up to the fact that there has not been any system of racial discrimination be it legal or cultural for many decades, increasing. DEI hiring and whites constantly sinking in wealth and income against other groups are the biggest redpills that normies are taking in right now. The wog pack problem will present itself time and time again and it is sufficient to show it to normies as much as possible as soon as it happens. In 2023 only the worst fruitcake is able to assert that there exists racial discrimination in white countries against blacks. Normies are getting receptive and I can feel their patience slowly eroding. We might not have time to revert anything but a strongly self aware White global minority can be our ticket to make it out of the century.

Just say you are jewish, simple as. I have been using this trick for years now, when they make me take a "DEI" seminar I say I am jewish and watch everyone tremble in my presence. I have accused so many people of antisemitism it is unreal, and it works, it REALLY works. Someone will say something like, fuck christianity and the bible. And I will say: Why don't you just say you hate all the jews and get it out of your system! They then say: I was talking about the bible not the jews. I reply with: 70% of the bible is the Torah, which is the jewish bible. They then begin vigorously apologizing to me. When they say that I am a privileged white cis male, I bring up the holocaust and watch them all sink into the floor and look away. These tricks really work anon, I have fucked over my co-workers so hard by larping as a jew. IT IS FUCKING GLORIOUS! I have been promoted twice in the last 2 years, and everyone is afraid to say ANYTHING to me. They have made special exemptions for me personally because I am jewish, I do not have to take DEI workshops anymore, and I get first pick for any new positions opening up. These tricks can work for you too anons, just say you are jewish, buy a 3 dollar yarmulke and add a few jewish words to your vocabulary and BAM!, you are jewish. The best part is that no one can force you to prove you are jewish because you can just bring up the holocaust and talk about the "yellow star". Leftists are utterly hopeless against these tricks, they are bound in their dogma so strongly that they will deny the evidence of their own eyes and ears. Anyway, good luck anons, I wish you all the luck in the world with implementing these tactics for your personal gain!

The trouble is that this increases short-term profits at the expense of American workers and the quality of products and services offered.

Many American businesses, esp. e.g. Fortune 500 companies, are not subject to anything like "market incentives." The US is not a capitalist system; none have existed since the 30s. The degree of government intervention in the economy is very heavy, and a very large proportion of jobs are make-work - for example, to satisfy preposterous regulatory requirements. In practice, the situation in the US resembles that in the Soviet Union, or other socialist states, rather closely, and is worse in many respects.

The Indian problem is worst at large firms, they have owners in a legal sense, but you're playing a sneaky game by trying to invoke the notion of some individual owner or owners who considers the situation in the manner described; they have, rather, stakeholders/shareholders, to which they have a fiduciary interest. Various non-Indian managers can pursue short-term profits by bringing in dothead scabs. As for the rest - many are willfully ignorant, just as they are willfully ignorant (the niggerfaggot official ideology here is a very powerful influence) of the true nature of homosexuals, or of the costs of diversity.

Large firms engage in many other very questionable and dubious practices, such as hiring employees according to quotas favoring "people of color" (niggers), despite the fact that niggers are incompetent deadweights on any organization.

Furthermore, if American business owners are guided by pragmatic considerations of profit and loss at the expense of all else, why didn't they do more to resist the imposition of the civil rights regime? Why don't they do more to reject it now? Implementing DEI policies is tremendously wasteful and destructive, after all.

>Racial harmony actually pretty good during and immediately after his administration.
>Opened the gates for politicians and federal 3 letter agencies to ignore the constitution.

>Stopped and even tore down sections of border wall, ended the hard fought "remain in mexico" policy and has been caught flying in the shittiest of shit skins in the world via plane.

>Gives a creepy speech in front of a haunting red background about his intention to imprison all opposition to his administration

Both rigged their first election, both noticeably worse than not having a president, both inherited extremely easy times to run the country and both worked as quickly as possible to undo the previous administrations greatest accomplishments.

right by balls:
since none of you can get your shit together:
2. Dubium regarding the assertion that the widespread practice of blessing same-sex unions is in accordance with Revelation and the Magisterium (CCC 2357).
According to the Divine Revelation, attested in Sacred Scripture, which the Church teaches, “listening to it devoutly, guarding it scrupulously and explaining it faithfully in accord with a divine commission and with the help of the Holy Spirit" (Dei Verbum, 10), "In the beginning," God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them, and blessed them to be fruitful (cf. Genesis 1:27-28) and hence, the Apostle Paul teaches that denying sexual difference is the consequence of denying the Creator (Romans 1:24-32). We ask: can the Church deviate from this "principle," considering it, in contrast to what was taught in Veritatis splendor, 103, as a mere ideal, and accept as a "possible good" objectively sinful situations, such as unions with persons of the same sex, without departing from the revealed doctrine?

October shall be an important moment in Church history and possibly the start of the next schism which will be on par with the Orthodox schism almost 1000 years ago.
What the current Curia and Pope is doing, is pure heresy and blasphemy. They are not Catholics. They are Luciferian Jesuits. Francis has already chosen his successor and appointed 30 pro Francis cardinals in his time. He wants total destruction of the Church.

Dark times are upon us. Blessed Anne's prophecies have come true.

But as Jesus told us, "You are Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my Church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it".
He will not allow them to achieve their ultimate goal. If a Schism must happen then I will leave and join the traditional true church. I will not support this unholy nonsense. My family have been Catholic going as far back to 10th century Irish records. I cannot in good conscience support this heresy and there are many like me who feel the exact same way.

software is dead. it's a sea of chinese and indians. DEI means no white men are allowed anymore. AWS is the last holdout, but their management will turn indian eventually just like Google and MS. I have been doing this shit for 30 years. Worked at top companies, FAANGS, it's all so tiresome now. They want your fucking life, for peanuts. It used to be Google treated you like a god to take every last one of your waking hours. Now it's just expected, or fuck offs there is an H1B waiting for your job.

Even startups are shit now. I am thinking of trying to just go into business for myself somehow. I don't think working in the industry makes sense anymore, not as a white man, not as a non H1B slave.

-t eng turned manager turned anti-(((capitalist)))

>State an opinion in a politically-incorrect way: "Whites should peacefully separate from Blacks due to recent date that almost 50% of Blacks surveyed Don't Agree with 'It's OK To Be White'". instead of "Blacks should fight for the freedom away from Whites due to Systematic Racism and Oppression"!

Have you been paying attention at all these past years? Even JK Rowling (Harry Potter Creator) went from "I Just Want Love and Peace; I'd irrationally Retcon my creations for DEI" to "It brings me great joy my successes hurt you. Anyone who slanders me as a bigot Nazi and whatnot: I'll take you to court to prove it. I'm a sometimes Millionaire/Billionaire Menopausal Woman with nothing to lose."

What's the solution to ESG and DEI? Non-retarded answers only.

>Hurr hurr, just don't watch moobies or the electric JEW!
Great fuckwit, you're protecting YOU. One person who was already spared. But your brilliant fucking plan let everyone else consume the slop, and now you're being sent to a re-education camp and you own nothing. This doesn't protect your kids, the society you live in, or your family. Your mental health and standard of living will continue to deteriorate because everyone around you is consuming constant propaganda. Putting your head in a hole is the solution of retards, fucktard.
>Kill da peepoo making da moobies durrr
REAL solutions, not shit that just gets a knock at your door from law enforcement and fuels narratives that you're dangerous and unhinged.

Studios make ESG/DEI shit because there's a financial incentive. They can't lose money. In the longrun they shrink their audience, but they're guaranteed profit so to them it seems like a situation they can't lose.

So how do we dismantle it and make it so considering those standards at all is decidedly unprofitable? What laws can be passed reasonably to penalize companies for making ESG shit?

>the catholics sacked constantinople for some ish ...

The Massacre of the Latins (Italian: Massacro dei Latini; Greek: Σφαγὴ τῶν Λατίνων) was a large-scale massacre of the Roman Catholic (called "Latin") inhabitants of Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, by the Eastern Orthodox population of the city in April 1182.[1][2]

The Roman Catholics of Constantinople at that time dominated the city's maritime trade and financial sector.[1] Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at 60,000 at the time by Eustathius of Thessalonica,[1] was wiped out or forced to flee. The Genoese and Pisan communities especially were devastated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the (Turkish) Sultanate of Rum.[3]

The massacre further worsened relations and increased enmity between the Western and Eastern Christian churches,[4] and a sequence of hostilities between the two followed.

which is why they are extremely incompetent.
>They're mostly lefty boomers and their kids who live in blue states, attend woke collages, want DEI initiatives in corporations, back ESG funding, etc.
Which won’t help them in a civil war.
>They are the ones giving orders to the FBI, the US Army, running the banks, when SHTF. Not only would the rebels' bank accounts be frozen like what happened in Canada, their banks would be liquidated, property seized, etc. The media would be reporting how "white nationalist extremists" want to "destroy our democracy"
Money means Jack shit in a civil war when people can just loot banks for money and nobody believes the media anymore especially when the media wouldn’t be able to reach anything

You cucks believed a woman would take up an anti-immigrant position. Women, fags, and assorted DEI are placed in government positions to do jew bidding.
Weak whites will be culled for their inaction. What you're going to experience will be 1000X worse than risk of prison for standing up for yourselves. Boiling frogs, et al.

One thing we do know is that today, leadership at government law-enforcement agencies, the military, corporate America, etc, are lefty commies in the tank for liberals.

They're mostly lefty boomers and their kids who live in blue states, attend woke collages, want DEI initiatives in corporations, back ESG funding, etc.

They are the ones giving orders to the FBI, the US Army, running the banks, when SHTF. Not only would the rebels' bank accounts be frozen like what happened in Canada, their banks would be liquidated, property seized, etc. The media would be reporting how "white nationalist extremists" want to "destroy our democracy"

We saw a version of that play out with the Jan 6 riots. And all the normies are going to hide in their suburbs waiting for their Teslas to charge.

Everyone told me to be a tradie, so i became an electrician

I make $31/hr, in 2 years when i get my license i'll be lucky to make $40/hr

$40/hr is barely enough to survive on currently, in 2 years it's going to be the equivalent of $30/hr

Idk what else to do, i have a B.S. but not going back for more schooling (debt). I've been teaching myself infosec/networking but everyone tells me that field is wrekt by pajeets and DEI

So i guess i'll just suffer in borderline poverty and pray for the end of the world
