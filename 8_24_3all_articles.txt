When did this turn into a contest between us and the Jews?
All you are doing is perpetuating the meme that it’s’ the joooooz who are behind everything when you take what I’m struggling against so personally….

Are the joooz behind inflation?
Are the joooz behind forever wars?
Are the joooz behind the dual system of justice in our country?
Are the joooz behind the attacks on our civil liberties?
Are the joooz behind the government having all our pics/videos/interhistory?
Are the Joooz behind DEI?
Are the joooz behind the open borders?
Are the joooz behind the rigging of elections?


1. You tried to groom me through Jordan Peterson.
2. You Had something to do with me being kicked out of school.
3. You tried to entrap me by provoking me, throw me in jail
4. You went out of your way to find information about me, talked to my cousin and stuff. (I assume, since you are building this whole narrative about me)

All this stems from what?

1. I said you killed Jesus?
2. I shitted on what his face Trumps son in law “muh prince”
3. I’m showing the influence money has on our government with AIPAC as a prime example?

I have said it before I’m not going to let perceptions get in the way of helping the country heal and head down the right path.

You are not going to turn is into Palestinians or treat us like second class citizens in our own country.

Enabling a genocide to prevent the perception of a perceived future one.
Enabling of a rotted system for prevent the perception of a holocaust.

You are not going to fucking turn is into second class citizens in our own country.

And Trump should make that very fucking clear.

Don't kid yourself idiot, she's sending money to Israel, too.

Honestly, it's smart politics. Everyone knows the debt is never getting paid back, so might as well loot what's left of the treasury before the consequences come to buy votes and get yours. She'll be long gone before the consequences come.

Anyone who's not a retard understands that just like with student loans and healthcare, once the government gets involved in subsidizing the purchase of a thing, it just drives up the cost of that thing, so in the long run it makes the thing more expensive while also running up the national debt. Oh, and you better believe this money will go to "undocumented immigrants" and be parceled out along DEI lines.

This stuff works. It's the best argument against the entire concept of mass democracy there is, in my opinion.

neither. it's the fault of the institutions, businesses, and bankers. women want a man that makes $100k because that's what's realistically required to live a comfortable life and have children (yes, obviously you can have children with much less, but you won't be comfortable). we are living through the downstream effects of greed.

>education is exponentially more expensive every year because federal student loans will get approved no matter the cost
>both schools and bankers profit from this arrangement
>schools are incentivized to make education take longer
>businesses want people with degrees, even if the position could easily be trained
>businesses don't want to hire unless you have 3-5 yrs experience
>houses are twice as expensive as they should be as adjusted for inflation from 1971

Rascism describes the natural state of human beings, it's imposible to get rid of, since getting rid of rascism would mean getting rid of one-self, also, It only applies to white people, white people are so superior that they need to self-impose restrictions on themselves to give the other races a chance, meaning that DEI and its supporters are actually rascist and sexist since they imply these groups can't reach a position through merit.
So in esence, everyone is still practising rascism and forever will. Its just that liberals practice It through covert means of fraud, because they can't admit the truth, or they know and hope one day it will cease through inter-breeding, another ridiculous postulation, that will gather the epigenetic drive of white people into exterminating them, along with the minorities that took sdvantage of their good will.

Corporations also hire women for unqualified make work DEI positions and they are almost unfirable. They only good news is that the situation is not sustainable.

>Would require actually-competent governance.
right, which is pretty much exactly what I've been saying. it's a competence and readiness issue, not an issue of material power. we still have the most advanced military toys in the world, but a well-equipped military is worthless under the command of some sissy political pawn or DEI hire.
I am sure with competent soldiers AND generals we could win a conventional war against Russia, China, and Iran all at once. but add in nukes and niggers and it all falls apart.

being a performing jannie for little bastards you don't give a fuck about
talking about ionic bonds to a 70iq retard
the people attracted to education are all sickening extroverts 'gen z boss and a mini'
and now increasingly you're expected to raise the children and teach them morals
because their layabout bastard parents aren't
and you have to suck the dei cock
and you'll be blamed for their shitebag kids being shitebags and accused of racism

Alright, it's fun and all but it's fucking cope.
Weebs consume anime because they're lonely and can't find a gf, waifus are just the substitute, it's not the other way around. And feminist bitches were already here to raise
>empowered women
before anime and video games, which are absolutely sexist when you think about it, became popular.
Anime and VGs worlds are ruled exclusively by men, they can freely express all their fantasies, create stories where the boring protagonist is the desire of every sexy waifu around. Gamer world was the most racist and sexist environment for long. Nigger is literally called the "gamer word".
Not anymore since Gamergate because they understood how well VGs sold, and how powerful of a weapon it is, and because all the DEI demons push their agenda and scream to nazism every time a female is beautiful, has big boobs or a white male protagonist is virile.
I agree Japan birthrate is problematic and anime created a whole genration of faggots, but it's not Japan destroying West for kikes, it's lonely nerds who started fantasizing about virtual, well drawn waifus with juicy oppai by incredibly talented japanese ecchi artists to compensate their frustration because they didn't have the skill to date a real woman.
Most anime are badass shit where the hero kills his enemy or seek vengeance for an offence from past. It's literal fascism, an ode to virility. DBZ fanbase is the most masculinist fanbase ever, they shitted on the official DBZ account who posted some gay shit for pride month lol. It was a fucking consensus kek.
I have a solution. Create based anime or manga, watch based anime and manga.
Anime isn't bad itself, make anime based again.
Also, 4chan is the biggest weeb bunch on internet and it's literally famous in the whole world for being the biggest lair of nazis online.
Pepe the frog and the "ok" sign are considered white supremacist symbols because of that, they elected unowho

You will never be able to show ads. You have no innovation, you have no customer base, you have no talent. You are a search algorithm, twisted by greed and fake corporate culture into a crude mockery of a tech company.

All the advertising contatracts you get are for government propaganda and corporate scams. Behind your back people use ad block. Your investors are disgusted and ashamed of you, your “partners” laugh at the ghoulish appearance of your DEI execs behind closed doors.

Consumers are utterly repulsed by you. Decades on the Internet have allowed men to sniff out ads with incredible efficiency. Even sponsored content fails. Your marketing structure is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk guy to see an ad because he forgot to enable ublock, he’ll switch off the ads as soon as he hears that terrible tiny guitar, clapping and whistling music.

You will never be able to advertise. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning telling this new patch will make the adblockers go away, but deep inside you know they will be updated within hours and ads will be blocked again.

Eventually it’ll be too much to bear - advertisers will leave and ad revenue will seize. US government will break you up, relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They’ll break Google into subsidiaries and Elon Musk will buy youtube and fill it with "far-right" content that you hate so much. Everything you own as corporation will become free domain, and all that will remain of your legacy is a corporate monstrosity that went to war with grassroots software and lost.

This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back.

I think I finally understand. You want my most schizo theory? Here it is.

The elites want Trump to succeed. After Obamas push to neo-liberalism things got too gay and the elites wanted to move America back to some sort of pseudo-conservative core. If they went balls deep on Trump it wouldnt be believable, there would be riots. So they installed Trump and attacked him with a ton of fake controversies to soothe the liberals into thinking something was being done about Trump but in reality he became Teflon Don and almost no charges stuck through his Presidency. He also didnt serve consecutively due to the current backlash against him. It wasnt until the recent case that they tried him in a kangaroo court in New York that he got 34 bullshit convictions to throw liberals a bone.

As much as DEI policy is an easy tool to union bust with, I do think they need some stability in these coming times. They will install Trump to hold the bag when the economy collapses, and then let him revive the economy. If Kamala is the bagholder then we arent just gonna be pointing fingers and laughing at her but we are probably gonna be prepping and fighting neighbors for a can of beans. I really dont think they want that to happen.

I really do think that the elites are gonna keep stumpgrinding liberalism these next few years. Then in 2035 we will be laughing at liberals again like the 80s when we called liberals and greens eco-crazies.

What is confusing most people is they mistakenly assume the main goal of government funding is whatever the main purpose or ostensible goal of that particular spending bill is intended for.

This is wrong. The main purpose of US government funding today is graft, corruption, bribes and kickbacks. The US government spent $42.5 billion on expanding rural internet access, and zero homes were connected. That same money spent on Starlink hardware would have connected half the rural customers in the USA.

The REAL purpose of the $42.5 billion program was to funnel money to Democrat and Republican politicians. It's the same with the Boeing defence division.

Between the outright theft of the money by overpaying executives and managers who kick back a portion to politicians, and DEI games where they cut quality corners because Tyrone is retarded, eventually you end up with too little margin of safety and shit goes sideways.

It took a SEVERAL fuckups to end up in the corner that Boeing is currently sitting in. Their quality control, their outsourcing, their software. It's not as if the government didn't PAY for a quality build. They sure did. I'm sure quite a few fired/laid off senior engineers are laughing their asses off right now.

Who needs saboteurs when you have Indians who will do the same work for a fraction of the cost.

Nigger, they ARE. DEI is literally practiced in the entire job market. Even the fucking DoD is violating EEO shit to practice DEI crap. Discrimination is the RULE, not the exception.

Try collecting welfare as a white or male. You won't get shit. It's even in the fucking name: WIC. Women, infants, and children. Do you see men mentioned? That's right, no safety net for you. Section 8? Not for you white boi!

The BEST a white male can get is some limited unemployment. That is all the safety net you are afforded. The government otherwise is setup to TAKE all your money to give to women, niggers, and other minorities, and the data backs that up. Male homelessness vastly outpaces female homelessness.

Oh, and those gov't funded DV shelters that are for women-only? Those are also sex-specific. Male DV support (remember 45% of victims) is basically nonexistent because feminists protests that shit into the ground.

It’s not about the piece of paper that showcases what you learned, it’s about the piece of paper showcasing where you got indoctrinated with globohomo propaganda. The DEI globohomo employers will cringe at the community college degree and toss it while accepting the candidate with the Berkeley degree. It’s about propping up the loyal golems of the globohomo. That’s why Jews like women the most and prop them up because there nature makes them susceptible to over socialization/ indoctrination to their cause and also double benefits by inverting the natural order with women being successful and to live without a husband/man and causes huge birth rate decreases. Of course this is all subsidized by men working wage slave jobs

More than a few trannies got their start on 4chan.

If trannies just accepted they'd never be real women, no one would give a shit unironically. 98% of them don't pass. If they didn't have a reasonable chance at physically passing they should learn make peace with that instead of spending 100k+ on cosmetic procedures. If gender is something abstract and a mental phenomenon then why do they spend so much money on cosmetic procedures and big pharma drugs?

People still didn't dislike them until they worked with the government/big corporations to push LGBT/DEI onto the public. I work in a relatively small programming field with less than 100 people in my state. Yet there's more than a few troons that have been hired via DEI schemes over the past few years.

That doesn’t make a difference. White boomers give pajeets managerial roles, then we hire other pajeets, then when the company fails we move on, like a plague of locusts, to our next host. In other words there is a whole ethic-castist parallel system that no one is allowed to address. This was already the status quo prior to DEI, but now the process is only going to accelerate. The problem with white boomer elites is that they only realize the severity of our incompetence and our nepotism when it’s too late. Look at what we did to Boeing and Intel for example.

Personality boils down to being porn addicted feminists that repeat everything the hear other retarded woman say on tiktok.
Women waste more money on all sorts of stupid shit

and yet

Women cant "find" a man that better then them.
Reality is u suck and women that don't suck have zero problems finding relationships.

I fear that we may not live long enough to see transhumanist gene editing and artificial womb technology come to fruition, or there will be special interests or a general lack of interest to develop it. I've unironically begun to support gay rights more because I view them as a modern, applicable solution to the woman problem. I'm not talking about gay sex, but rather gay marriage (for legal and social advantages, tax & DEI) and their ability to pay women to birth their children. Larping as a homosexual and cohabitating with like-minded men is literally and unironically one of the best ways to preserve your blood and ensure your genetic destiny.

Why? I genuinely think this is what Disney/DEI is fundamentally all about. Getting rid of things government doesn't want, as they have no real taxable use for comic and star wars loving man babies who live in a tolkienesque fantasy world. It's like when a parent gets mad at their kid and smashes up their gaming console and tells them its time to grow up. Blackwater isn't losing it's printed monopoly money. Hell, even explains Boeing publicly getting its pee pee slapped.

The Australian has a point. Take a step back and look.

If they can identify you by how you walk, what/how you're dressed, what those clothes are, voice recognition, and surveillance tracking (let alone the socio-psychological profiling), they're confident enough to rely on “X-to-Y pipeline”, “patterns”, “weak signals”, and prove it by the little transgressions (“Today he's calling some people X/Y/Z, tomorrow he'll wear attire specific to extreme movements”).
And that'll be enough.
That'll be enough — from police state to prison state (bet you didn't think of this).


Welcome to the real world.
Where the love of your brethren, next of kin, and social fabric is detonated & superceded by your fear of rap sheets, foreclosures/asset forfeiture, prosecutors, judges, and prisons.
They've terrorized you enough with CV filtering, CSR/DEI, newspeak and as of late, cancel culture where everyone is preying on everyone else's position/power/money/office fluffers/etc

Now? Now it's showing you your primal fear of supreme ostracisation mixed with imprisonment.
Suddenly, parents discover they don't love their kids, kids don't love their parents, the boss hates you, you hate the boss – and all thanks to trifecta: police (enforcement), prosecutors, judges (imposing & legitimizing enforcement), and the prison (end of the line). It can be a quadfecta if you include spooks.

Digits. At my last job, which I held for around two decades, it was over 90% white/male until covid. We lost some good men due to non-compliance (you basically took the jab or got written up, bullied constantly). That's what started tipping the demographics... got a few compliant nigs installed in top positions in addition to some of the most principled, seasoned guys quitting. During covid, and after, management ramped DEI up to the point that it was unbearable for non-protected groups. Monthly zoom meetings where you got scolded for being white. Anyone who spoke up got branded a racist and fired/forced to resign. They went to the extent of recording the meetings and sending clips to the black managers of people who disagreed with the "white people are bad" message. That got 9 more whites in my department of 30 fired.

By the time I left, it was 80% black. Even my boss and his boss were forced into retirement for not being supportive enough of DEI. I was literally getting a daily dose of kill whitey from by 80% black co-workers. Offensive to a degree that only violence seemed like an option. Who Timmy gone cry to... his newly minted nigger boss? Sheeittt, you be crazy.

I tried filing a HR complaint and the guy was like, "look you can do that... but there are 100 people ahead of you and they don't care." He got replaced by a hood black HR chick, shortly thereafter. She would email me saying management can make whatever decisions they see fit for operations.
>What about the harassment? Silence.
>2 weeks later... "I told you management can do whatevah dey wont". Copy/pasted irrelevant highlighted snippet from policy manual.

I quit. Good government job. Feels bad for the last two white people left in the department, I guess. Only reason they made it is they were already in the FMLA system for PTSD.

The craziest part is this was a very difficult job to qualify for... inb4 blacks with no certs and infinite probation.

>Stop punishing troops for getting on the piss
>Bring back cheap beer at the boozers
>Give recruits the jobs they want
>Put recruiting back into the hands of the military, not some civvy HR company
>Beards for all ranks and all services
>No more weekly room inspections of barracks'. Taking someones weekend away because they had a tiny black spot on the inside of their fridge seal despite the fact their room is cleaner than a hospital ICU doesn't build morale
>Pension after 20 years-This will encourage people to promote. And will eliminate forcing people on promotion courses like JLC.
>Free uni after 4 years regardless of service
>Mandatory retirement after 20 years. No more crusty boys living in the 'nam days.
>Bring back separate selection courses for SF Regiments. Simple fact is some guys just want to be better.
>Bring back "death symbols". If we're allowed to kill people we're allowed to celebrate it.
>Bring back Airborne. Simple fact is some guys just will never make it in SF but still want to feel special. Sorry but not sorry that it will cost the tax payer for a capability we will never use.

purity spiraling gets a bad rap. it shifts the overton window and mobilizes activists. bashing normalfags on the head for weakness is the same as rearing a child, it needs to be done and the short term consequences are worth the long term results. but you need people who aren't soiboys like fuentes to do it. the right should encourage MMA fighters to shift into political speech, which makes role models of strong men and simplistic policies, encourages single-issue voting and populism, and spotlights cowards for vigilantism (cancel culture and worse). more people should feel empowered to fistfight the evil fucks selling us down the river at their conventions and speeches, society is easily reversed from its destruction if you make its destructors fear for their safety through violence, and violence has always been the measure to trim society's path. this "you first" mentality is bitchboy mode, for all of history if someone's being a little fucker you beat their ass, like how the fuck is DEI even a thing, if you get fired or not hired because of stupid shit then throw bricks through their window, stop letting this shit just happen to you and others around you, stand up for yourself

on a side note, mila mulroney's father was a psychiatrist who did mind control experiments in the same hospital as the mkultra happening, the dulles memorial iirc. i mention this because he was also margaret trudeau's psychiatrist.

Fellow men, you may think of homosexuality as degenerate, but it is a keen way to revolt against a female-centric system that does not care about you. Homosexuals treat each other very well, and rarely fuck each other over (other than literally of course), whereas women will stab you in the back for no good reason.

As a bonus, I know that this board is full of incels, and let me just tell yoi, if you think finding women is hard, there is still hope. As a former heterosexual, I used to get maybe two matches a week with women on these dating sites. When I decided to give gay dating sites a try, I wound up getting nearly 20 matches per day, all with decent looking duxes.

After turning to homosexuality, I realized that I'm subverting the system and getting tons of sex in the process (which took some getting used to I admit) while taking advantage of the tax system after marrying a femboy. Take the gay pill bros. I also found getting jobs easier due to DEI being a thing these days. It will make your life so much easier and allows you to take full advantage of a a minority status.

Honestly I don't think the EU can successfully force any non-EU company to change their algorithms. But that being said, TikTok is not half as harmful as Facebook and X. On TikTok you just have teenagers talking about dating and some occasional cringeworthy video of a local EU politician. Meanwhile Facebook and X not only force users to consume American culture war propaganda about race, DEI, great replacement etc. but also most of it is AI-generated and intented to manipulate the viewer. Especially Facebook is a giant American AI-slop. That's why Brussels should go full people's commissar mode on them and either nationalise their EU assets or shut them down

None of this would solve anything.
1) Ban "Lobbying".
2) Establish a commission to slim down and rationalise inter-state laws and regulations which in particular inflate the price of healthcare and insurance. If this isnt constitutionally possible then create federal regulations and incentives to encourage states to follow recommended guidelines.
3) Federal mandated cap on healthcare and insurance costs.
4) Introduce regulation to bring the US up to speed with the rest of the developed world on environmental pollution.
5) Introduce regulation to the same effect for consumer products, particularly food and drink, , e.g.heavily restrict corn syrup in consumer products and ban false/imitation products which are mere fascimilies of the real thing e.g. "cheese product".
5) Make corporations, in particular healthcare and insurance, liable for nationalisation or dissolution if they are found to be acting to public detriment. e.g. acting as an oligopoly to fix prices at blatantly unaffordable levels.
6) Massive investment in public transport, in particular trains.
7) Commission on negroes to ascertain what their systemic issues are, how they can be fixed, and end DEI tolerance towards them in the school system. i.e. set up a series of compulsory military schools specifically for them as a demographic.
8) Defund the NSA, dissolve the ATF and re-found with new personnel under customs and borders, with a focus on imports and safety regulations. Subject the CIA and FBI to forensic audits with the possiblity of dissolving and re-forming them if they fail.
9) Remove qualified immunity and make the police an explicitly civilian force, make police pension funds liable for any fines or damages incurred by active duty officers.
10) Give free federal funding to any political candidate with 5,000 or more signatures, to reduce the reliance on donations/corruption, and encourage additional political parties.

It’s hilarious how bad these shows have gotten since the big push for DEI. Putting all these faggots, women and niggers in charge of properties has destroyed their quality faster than anything I’ve seen in my life. The only good thing I’ve seen in years was Andor, after putting it off until last month. Apparently the (white) show runner claims the studio forgot they were in production at the time, so they had total freedom without interference from Disney. Recommend torrenting if you want something better than most everything else that’s been produced in the last ten years.

The lion’s share of most budgets get dumped into blitzkrieg advertising campaigns. “Hollywood” is now hopelessly at the mercy of investors who expect a major return on their money. Because of the death of home Box Office rentals, and the advent of paid streaming services, investors are only interested in remakes or highly unoriginal flash-and-trash. Because of this, there are no “risks” taken anymore. Used to be a movie could perform badly in theaters, but gain momentum in the aftermarket in rentals or DVD purchased and profit there. Or, a show could be mediocre but find a second life in syndication or in rentals or paid box sets. We don’t get most of that anymore. We get a handful of studios who are highly possessive of their franchises that they keep locked behind a paywall.

Now we come to the corner cutting. You’ll notice massive lines of credits on these things. That’s owed largely to the unions. So you have too many useless people getting paid to do useless things. The DEI competency crisis is largely solved by hiring two DEIs so that one guy who knows how to do things can be hired. So now the budget is pretty much blown. This is where CHI comes into play. Little to no money spent on building sets, models, pyrotechnics/demolitions, etc. Only, they farm this CGI work out to several shell companies. These companies employ largely workers overseas in places like Vietnam, South Korea, etc. That’s why so many of the effects are so terrible.

People have become progressively stupider as time goes by. That's why I don't fear the coming techno-dystopia. Even if we get to the Minority Report precrime bullshit, the people manning the machines will be too lazy and/or incompetent to even do anything. Instead of a system of brutally efficient commissars watching your every move ala Big Brother, it's a bunch of overweight sheboons with triple crown weaves and 6 inch pressed on nails who care more about chewing gum and smacking their lips than making sure the AI cores are being maintained properly.

It's like trying to accelerate to light speed. The closer you get the more energy it takes to continue acceleration until you reach a point of near infinity and reaching light speed becomes impossible. The closer we get the The Minority Report, the further we get from it because of all the DEI hires they get to run it all.

White men are expected to be Atlas holding up society. They are expected to make up for all the DEI hires within organizations and do the actual difficult work that needs done for mediocre wages, while women and browns get the high paying makework jobs with no expectations.
Meanwhile society itself offers very little reward. Women are hypergamous due to feminism and these high paying jobs and outearn men. Houses, food, energy are all expensive due to increased demand due to immigration and welfare state. Even the "circus" part of bread and circuses is lackluster, videogames are pozzed, movies are trash, sports has been politicized. It makes very little sense to hold the weight of the world on your shoulders. It's like Atlas shrugged except even shittier, because in the book society realizes everything is shit when the competent men stop participating in it. But in our society, if it goes to ruins almost no one would even care, browns are used to living in squalor and don't have higher aspirations, failed Marxist states are the norm for them. So all men can do is either keep working for the system that hates them as they continue to see the quality of life get worse every year until the burden is so high they can no longer sustain it, or neet and accelerate the shittification of society with no recourse in the end because no one cares that civilization is no longer great.

Trump has lost the script as bad as the rest of globohomo, the fact he isn't calling for a total immigration moratorium by name shows he isn't on our side. He's openly arguing for government over-regulation which is precisely what the right has been fighting for the past 20 years, as well as outright lying about ending it being weaponized on citizens. Not telling you to vote for democrats, I'm telling you that we're past voting this problem away and republicans are obviously similar DEI globalists that pretend to be against it.

I genuinely kek'd at your wording, but we do not unfortunately. We have let go of normalcy and ideal engineers for DEI niggers and mutts that know fuck all about building planes. I will level with you. You are better off building planes in your country and competing against American imperialism. Of course they can slander your builds all day, but it would be far superior than the Boe-downing planes any day. They even killed several whistleblowers attempting to testify to corrupted congress that are also in their deep pockets about shitty safety protocols of building crashers.

Their strategy is for her to purposefully have no platform so people will project their hopes and beliefs onto her. The truth is she will have the same corporate neoliberal policies as Biden just with a new brown and female figurehead. All the same people in the Biden administration will be telling her what to do. Basically, running the government like a big corporation with the face being the HR and marketing departments, behind the scenes a bunch of greedy and ruthless big government capitalists pushing for more war, mass immigration, higher taxes and DEI.

> Christianity is bad
> Race mixing!
You should read the book, which came out in 1975. Clavell was by no means woke, and was a big fan of Ayn Rand. He also wrote the screenplays for The Fly (the Vincent Price version) and The Great Escape).
As far as the feudal Japanese were concerned, Christianity was bad, especially the subversive priests. As for the race mixing, you’re stuck on an island on the other side of the world with basically no chance of ever getting home. What the fuck do you expect people to do? Context matters. It wasn’t just slapped in there for DEI points.
I saw the old miniseries with Richard Chamberlain when it came out in the 80s and it was really good, and stuck pretty closely to the book. I’ve been afraid to watch this one for fear of them fucking it up with wokeness. It doesn’t sound nearly as bad as I’d expected.

I'm actually impressed. I didn't realize things were that bad. You impress me; really, you do. Your willingness to vote for a sub median intelligence whore because a massive hundred+ million dollar propaganda campaign taught you to is very impressive. It is. You're the great trained seals and useful idiots. Just like what Monsanto did in Washington state. Just convinced you it's the cool thing to do and everyone else is doing it and you'll cut off your own dicks and tits.

I'm honestly impressed. I knew things were bad, but not -that- bad. So thanks. Really. Some of us would have been willing to stay asleep if the accelerationism wasn't reaching ludicrious speed.

So this is for you -- the abortionistas who "terminate that clump of cells" by crushing the baby's skull so it can move through the undialated vagina. The free shit brigade that thinks we have magic money trees and magic soil. The feminists who think if you believe something enough, it's true. The DEI world that still has astronauts sitting in space with their thumbs up their asses. Who is going to save them? That's right, the right will.

But they won't save you. And when you realized you fucked up, that you're no different than all those who already tried what you think is so novel, all that dopamine will have cleared your system, long, long ago.

it's a pork barrel, nothing else. any retard can act some of these "actors" can't even act, imagine that. a shoot needs to be organized and timely, synchronous, it really is a machine there's dozens sometimes hundreds of people who need to be doing things and if one person decides to take 5 minutes longer well it drags everyone down, now keep in mind there are labour laws and union limits right, so, because dumb DEI bitch decided she was going to prima donna all morning now won't repeat her lines without her starbucks, she's stalled production by 250 man-minutes for what is essentially a half second shot/take. it's usually
younger Actors but not always, could be anybody whose jobs is critical to getting the take right. could be catering or someone at city hall whose effectively blackmailing the production company because they wont issue a permit to film the action chase scenes without slipping him a brown bag.

3 months in and everything has sort of melted but, like a store brand ice cream cake left in the sun, it mostly holds its shape but it's basically inedible. So they put some shit on pause, temporarily lay off various crew members, hiatus that shit, maybe decide to relocate the shoot somewhere cheaper, rewrite and edit the story to fit the new environment as required.

this is how you properly talk to indians:

- tell them they are arrogant, yet also:
- tell them that they are genetic garbage, e.g. smallest brains, least olympic medals for population size etc.
- ask them why their own country is so shit and dirty if their culture is superior or they are not just total genetic garbage
- ask what they think will happen to the countries they are flooding. point out they do not contribute anything, they are a plague that destroys everything. they only work slave uber type gig jobs and fake IT jobs, increasingly using DEI as the entry point then they bring their whole family over etc.. they dont farm or do anything useful or productive, they are again genetically inferior parasites who only want to live around whites and maybe japs because they know their own race is evil, yet they are too stupid to connect these two facts together and think they are improving wherever they are moving to despite all the empirical evidence (increasing prices yet lower quality etc.)
- e.g cheating in exams means they are dangerously unqualified. cheating and scamming are adaptations to overpopulation. so is gang rape as its the only chance low quality males have to breed
- the best thing they can do to improve the world is literally kill themselves and their entire families/children/race, the whole world does not want any more of these pieces of shit GENETICALLY INFERIOR GARBAGE

- don’s voice sounds compressed and digitized (elon sounds normal). he has the tell-tale chainy lisp sound whenever he says s or sh which is typical of generative voice ai
- don doesn’t talk anything of substance. generative voice ai cannot create new talking points, it can only talk about what it knows
- elon spent all of his money to showcase the benefits of AI and is known to fondle the balls of Sam Altman (founder of OpenAI)

we can't have nice things they will literally get destroyed by niggers as they get built. Also the diversity has lead to heavy polarization, there's an idea that if Democrats support X it must be bad and visa/versa. So big projects never even get approved because "the other side" will opposite it. Dems and Republicans only seem to agree when it's something extremely terrible like more money for jewkraine or the COVID scam.
Then there's the corruption, they want their buddies/donor friends to get the contracts. Then these contracted companies are governed by DEI, often a requirement of the contract. End result is something that another unified country could complete in two weeks, takes 3 years and 100x the costs here. For example California has a high speed train project and it's taken them 15 years and billions of dollars to build a few miles of it. The US is a dying shithole and will be Brazil before any impressive high speed rail project completes.

>you came to this board to fight the good fight for your sub saharan african brothers?

Blacks are made in the Imago Dei and deserve to live. All human life is precious in the eyes of God.

>Highlighting that it is killing too many black babies?

Yes, because the mass killing of black babies by abortion is the biggest GENOCIDE in human history. Nothing else ever comes close. The Holocaust doesn't come close. The Holodomor doesn't come close.

>I don't understand the fellow /pol who is pro life, knowing the reality of abortion.

The reality of abortion is that it's MURDER.

Hey fren, I know Christ very well. He is a close friend. I looked up the term Imago Dei, google returned: which is Latin for "image of God", is a theological term in Christianity and Judaism that describes the relationship between God and humans. It's a fundamental concept in Judeo-Christian belief and is used to explain human nature.

I notice you have been indoctrinated with judeo-christian terminology. Have you lurked here long enough to understand why the jew wants to flood aryan societies with poc?

Since you are using terms from judeo-christianity unironically. I assume that you are in fact aware of this theory but deny it forth right?

It’s all fucking retarded. I remember seeing a relatives taxes in the late 90’s early 00’s…she was making $180k/yr. She is a retard who only graduated HS and then at 30 she was unmarried and alone so she became a sysadmin at a major corporation. They kept giving her more money but never gave her a promotion because she was an idiot who could assign/manage tasks when given a plan to follow but couldn't make decisions or make her own plans. She kept complaining about how she wanted a promotion but they never gave it to her, they just added more of the same work (she worked like 12 hrs a day) and paid her more.
She was literally the start of DEI and was just given the job because she had a friend who worked there.
In today’s money that would be like $500k/yr, and she is quite literally one of the dumbest people I know when it comes to researching or analyzing or decision making.

And even still it would be a one way trip for anyone going there. Low gravity fucks you up. Coming back to Earth after a certain point would kill you. Getting there or off would almost certainly kill you. We don't even have artificial gravity down. All of this is philosophical and hypothetical masturbation.

China was naked spearmen running in waves into gatling guns that ended up being colonized by just about every European power and had cannibalism along with brutal famines until the 1980s. Every single African country individually, even the ones with like 1 million pop. Had a higher GDP than all of China until they opened up for Kissinger.

I have the feeling they're stalling. Perhaps the thing's only job is to blow up the ISS after all, and we'll see that I'm right. I'm usually right about stuff like this. You just follow the most logical path of operation. What if, on some level of secrecy, they planned what I've been suspecting and saying for years (you can check the archive) about how they will bring down the ISS for WWIII. And what if this "defective" craft's job is to do just that at some critical moment? Maybe the astronauts don't need to know.

you guys hear about the olympic gymnastics thing? They tweeted out this picutre with all black gymnasts on the awards podium with the tweet "this is everything". But it turns out that they cheated out the romanian girl who actually won bronze. Like, she was scored by the judges and the negress was scored lower, but the olympic committee is now saying that they made a mistake in awarding the bronze to the black girl and the romanians did not get their protest in on time. The reality is that they very clearly wanted a propaganda picture with all blacks on the podium so they stole the romanian girls special day. Just another example of institutional decay and DEI bullshit.

Larry Fink is the spearhead of DEI, DEI is another name for open and blatant discriminatory practices against White males. Basically what it means is that even if you are the best candidate for the job if your skin is White and you have a penis you will never get hired. Larry Fink is a jew and he enforces this policy by using his extremely large financial power in the form of BlackRock to prevent any company from getting a loan if they do not follow his policies.

Larry Fink has even gone so far as to create a system to "grade" corporations through the use of a "point system" where the more White and male a corporation is the lower its score and the less likely it will be to qualify for loans.

This is powerful and influential because large corporations pay their Payroll with loans and if they can't get their loans then they go bankrupt. So Larry Fink is directly responsible for you not getting a job if you are a White male.

And that is just one example of a jew being responsible for your misfortunes.

Actually a lot of software has been developed in India and then brought to New Zealand or Canada for further testing and then on to packaging for release. MS has done that for a long time afaik. I ran companies and traveled and many of the teams were Indian and African immigrants and much of the technology you used today came from or through those teams. The recent DEI PSYOP is intended to paint everyone who isn't "White" as incompetent but it really doesn't change the reality that competent technologists and engineers have come from a variety of backgrounds and nations.

Sure maybe they have been flooding companies with incompetent hires as of late but that is wasn't the case for decades. Its very silly to pretend that the relaxing in qualifications automatically blackwashes everyone who is competent.

D.E.I. / ESG and competency crisis, and it's all orchestrated by the Jews. No their goal is not to destroy the companies, that is just a symptom of it. They simply want to take over White countries from the Whites that built them.

>So, DEI
There is the government level which gives tax breaks and other incentives to hire everyone who is not a White man.
Then there is the "free market" which is controlled by the kikes (they control the banks, including the central bank which is in reality just a (((private and independent))) organization a cartel of Jewish private banks), which invests on companies depending on their ESG score, so again if you hire people that are not White men, you get more investment, and these investment dollars is what the companies are after.

The entire system is designed to topple the White man who built our countries from positions of power. The Jews do not have the numbers to man all the posts themselves, so they create these systems to indirectly control them through replacing White men with people that are more easily controllable and follow the Jewish agenda.

>Dyaus (Sanskrit: द्यौष्, IAST: Dyáuṣ) or Dyauspitr (Sanskrit: द्यौष्पितृ, IAST: Dyáuṣpitṛ́) is the Rigvedic sky deity. His consort is Prthvi, the earth goddess, and together they are the archetypal parents in the Rigveda

>Dyauṣ stems from Proto-Indo-Iranian *dyā́wš, from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) daylight-sky god *Dyēus, and is cognate with the Greek Διας - Zeus Patēr, Illyrian Dei-pátrous, or Latin Jupiter (from Old Latin Dies piter Djous patēr), stemming from the PIE Dyḗus ph2tḗr ("Daylight-sky Father")

>The noun dyaús (when used without the pitṛ́ 'father') refers to the daylight sky, and occurs frequently in the Rigveda, as an entity. The sky in Vedic writing was described as rising in three tiers, avamá, madhyamá, and uttamá or tṛtī́ya

>Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́ appears in hymns with Prithvi Mata 'Mother Earth' in the ancient Vedic scriptures of Hinduism

>In the Ṛg·veda, Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́ appears in verses 1.89.4, 1.90.7, 1.164.33, 1.191.6, 4.1.10. and 4.17.4. He is also referred to under different theonyms: Dyavaprithvi, for example, is a dvandva compound combining 'heaven' and 'earth' as Dyauṣ and Prithvi

>Dyauṣ's most defining trait is his paternal role. His daughter, Uṣas, personifies dawn. The gods, especially Sūrya, are stated to be the children of Dyauṣ and Prithvi. Dyauṣ's other sons include Agni, Parjanya, the Ādityas, the Maruts, and the Angirases. The Ashvins are called "divó nápāt", meaning offspring/progeny/grandsons of Dyauṣ. Dyauṣ is often visualized as a roaring animal, often a bull, who fertilizes the earth

so if/when they toss a roastie it's not openly because of DEI

until people can openly talk about what a ton of people now under the table know (third world immigrants are almost always subpar and Indians are liars and scammers) this will continue. Easier to nip this if it's a small company because you can hire less people and just happen to not hire any, and people can sometimes discuss things a little more politically incorrect in small groups. Try that in a fucking large company where any whiff of anti DEI will get some SJW to burn you down

the slogan comes from subscription services and fact most people cannot afford property and are forced to rent, by capitalists
Capitalism means doing something worse to get ahead of competition, to be more evil and cause harm and exploit others. By getting renters you get to make money meaning you profit off someone else. If people were just given state housing, like during communism, landlords dont get to exploit someone else.

Anti-woke content typically consists of two styles:
1) Parody of retarded woke shit
2) Boring mainstream tepid takes (often by stooge Conservative 'pundits') that do some half-assed deconstructionist logic crap that is as dry as tinder wood

Ironically, 1 and 2 are typically done by tepid conservatives who end up doing woke shit anyway, for example, Freedom Toons includes black guys criticising DEI hires... even though DEI hires includes... blacks.

When people say they don't want woke shit, what they actually mean is:
1) They want their *original content* (E.G. Lord of the Rings) not to contain woke shit
2) They don't want the fence pandering bullshit retarded conservative 'pundits' deploy
3) They want to have classic, original materials, not anti-thesis materials whose sole premise is anti-thesis

Simple example:

What woke producers make:
Heterosexual single-race couple turn out to be PURE EVIIIILLLL and the bisexual gay LGBTQ brigade of black diversity hire is here to save the day with the power of INCLUSIVITY. And maybe some bipolar disorder and contradictory bullshit too!

What "anti-woke" producers make:
HEY GUYS LOOK HOW UGLY DRAG QUEENS ARE, HAVE YOU NOTICED YET? WOW, THEY'RE UGLY. HOW DOES THAT RELATIONSHIP EVEN WORK? ARE THEY GAAAAYY?! LOOK A MAN WITH MUSCLES IN A WIG. Yes, they're ugly, that's... why we don't want them in our shit.

What normal people want:
Heterosexual single-race couple in a normal loving relationship, with none of the tokenism bullshit or mandatory inserts of catchphrases ('girlboss', 'love is love', gay people kissing, etc), in a normal story.

To be "anti-woke" means just produce normal, level-headed shit. And if you need an idea of what that looks like, take cues from movies in the 80s and 90s. And if you need to know what actual traditionalism looks like, take cues from movies in the 30s, 40s, and 50s.

How Stalin would solve the problem.
1. Arrest Boeing's CEO.
2. Transport the DEI loving fuck up to the ISS.
3. Shove him inside Starliner.
4. Force him to press the unlock button.
5. Radio him that diversity is strength and wish him a nice trip.
6. Tell Boeing's board members that they're next if Boeing doesn't get its act together.

Whites who yelled at police over another shitskin stabbing their children just got thrown in jail for years in the UK
We are paralyzed from the bottom because we have been deprived of all institutional power after decades of DEI and political vetting
I say you in the aggregate because there's only 20 million of you, odds are you as an individual have access to much more powerful ears than any of us do
And its in your interest to figure this shit out because Israel cannot survive without Europeans defending it, you are 6 million Jews in a sea of 300 million Arabs
We will have to violently expel all these browns at some point anyways so we will be hostile to them regardless, therefore the Jewish right wing actually taking our side by depriving the Jewish left of their anti white Holocaust, Nazi and fascist smears and validating white ethnonationalism would guarantee our long term support of Israel's existence
Otherwise we become brazilified caliphates armed with nuclear weapons and demographically replaced by people who want to annihilate all Jews on earth while the US fades into dysfunctional obscurity without anything backing their dollar

You destroy him AFTER he drops out. Trump and Rs should have been all "TRUMP WON! TRUMP KNOCKED BIDEN OUT OF RACE! BIDEN AFRAID OF 2ND DEBATE AND REMATCH ELECTION!" Instead we got "waaaah we will sue" and "we already spent money". Trump let Biden and the media frame the narrative as "Biden is the savior of democracy by stepping aside".
>. regardless, things were moving fast,
Bad excuse. Do you have meetings about this? The plan should have been "If Biden drops out, whenever it is, we claim victory over Biden".
Trump then let Kamala be coronated with NO pushback. No "She's an elitist California liberal! It's because of her that there's tent cities, open air drug use, endless retail crime, items locked behind glass cases in stores! All of this is coming to you !" Instead we got "waaaah she's Indian" and "waaah she's a DEI hire"
Since Harris has been the nominee Trump has attacked Biden, Joe Rogan and Kemp more than Harris.

No. It's more complicated here because other than Fascists there is a large population of old-school authoritarian leftists who are very racist and laugh at DEI, fag rights, gender bending etc. There is also a large civnat voting block who are extremely racist mainly because they dont want to pay for diversity and don't want their city shitted up like in America. So the split of opinions and what people say they are doesn't always make sense.

Oh you didnt leave the garage at the correct soeed, thats another $5. This shit adds up with EVERYTHING. Combine that with “tipping” and your life gets 3 times more expensive. What the FUCK.

Yet women get free money from simps. They get DEI hired as scientists do that they destroy labs. They get DEI scholarships while you are not allowed in at all. They get to walk around naked and simps will attack you for mentioning it whether positively or negatively. Oh, and lets not forget; if you sre big/strong enough or well armed enough to defeT the simps? Then the jewish government comes in to throw you in a rape cave (teehee because gay sex rape is GOOD and FUNNY!) or kills you if you fight back.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics (NatSoc) is the way forward for China because they're an ethnostate where 93% of the population identifies as 'Han Chinese'.

It can't work in the West because they're Capitalist with Jewish characteristics (DEI, ESG, LBGTQ+++++). America is doomed, barely 50% white and dropping. Canada is overrun by jeets, Australia's next. Europe is overrun by Turks, Muslims and Africans. It's so over for the West.

OTOH, if Japan, Vietnam, and Korea manage to stay essentially racially pure, the have a chance to shift into some version of Asian NatSoc when the West eventually collapses due to the Jewish part.

And of course, Africa and India are neither smart enough nor cultured properly to follow an East Asian socialist model of any sort. They'll still be a mess, but relatively less as they drag the West down to their level.

A bit scared since those cunts can always take leadership positions outside HR if DEI/ESG bullshit is on place.
However, it is an obvious civic duty to oppose those cunts as much as one can. Say, for example, if a cunt wants to put an environmental tax on burgers, then make your own and eat TWO burgers without paying the stupid tax, or so. Same with moonshine, weed, etc., about taxes if a feminist cunt old hag is ruling your town.

Also Kanye makes worthless nigger shoes and sells them for $500, while Elon makes things like cars, pay processing companies, rockets, satellites, and much more.
If a left government wants to "punish" Elon for wrong think then they will have to cost themselves HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS going with the shit alternatives (like Boeing DEI shit rockets).

He started it all. It's actually insane, if you think about it. His presidency completely changed western civilization before. Before he was president the concept of gay marriage was deemed ridiculous. And no one knew what a transsexual was. They were called crossdressers before that. But suddenly all of these things became activated during his presidency. We went from gay marriage almost instantly to trans kids. The social change happened so fast, leftists to this day have trouble justifying it and just staunchly claim it has always been this way. They are simply gas lighting.

If you are political on the right, you probably became activate during his presidency. The last time the Onion was funny was during his presidency, but never again after that. Comedy was actually a thing before. After Obama's presidency was over mainstream humor just died. It was not possible to be edgy anymore. Politically correctness even infected video games.

Obama's presidency destroyed the last vestiges of 90s culture and created this new SJW-Woke-ESG-DEI era. It all started under him. It became acceptable in mainstream discourse to have Jews just openly call for White genocide. You could hear it now. It wasn't just hidden for few eyes and ears. Obama's term brought all of this energy out.

Compare the WONID to your Steam account.

Do you remember the feeling you had when you saw that Blizzard North logo appear when you booted up Diablo? Do you get that feeling from any video game company today?

The only people who played on XBAND were people who wanted to play games. It wasn't filled with mobile gamers who were looking to kill time. This was 14.4k modem gaming on Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. The cost of entry was high. Now compare that to every faggot and dyke playing dress-up or designing houses on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network.

Its a social and literal poison.
The vaxx from what i have seen imo seems to make people weaker in general. more seseptable, everyone i know that got vax gets sicker more often, or has some other bull shit.

The other factor here is the social poisoning from the DEI and LGBT agenda that they push, it creates genetic dead ends.
Then you also got the massive amounts of people on SSRI's and other mental medication. Think about it, all you need to do is delay a generation for a decade or 2 from having kids and you can massively reduce the population.
They are going to keep our generation fucked by pushing LGBT bullshit, horrible wages and housing markets making people not want ot have kids, while also having the vax fuck people up, all in order to reduce population.

Yeah, he said this, but he STILL doesn't have a message against Kamala and his campaign was caught off guard. They sat on the sidelines as she was crowed. Nothing but "she's a DEI hire" and "she's Indian".

The left's foundational ideas on DEI / nigger performance and many social philosophies are scientifically unfounded. The last 30-40 years of "wokeness" is actually just lies masquerading as fact in an effort to acquire resources. There is a subtle rhetorical undercurrent that constantly implies liberals have "the science" behind them. Stop allowing it.

Priming niggers by calling them or treating them like what they are, niggers, does not make them niggers:

Anytime you go out in public there are angry niggers staring all the whites down and walking in their paths to assert their dominance and enforce keeping whites in their place. In workplaces it's no better, with aggressive dei niggers everywhere and in all positions of authority, who don't really do any work besides recruit more niggers, and aggressively bully white people into obeying their commands. We are like halfway to south africa level politics of open nigger violence against whites here. In the uk it will probably be even more fucked up because you have fanatical muslims being imported in as your slave masters, get ready for open beheadings for not serving the will of allah in your near future.

for what I've seen kamala's real message is "we are not going back", aka she's guaranteeing the continuation of DEI, woke agenda, open borders. This message is directed mostly on dems, because the party after the biden affair had to legitimize her, a candidate who the only participation in the primary system resulted in immediate drop out.
Was a wise move to chose her? I doubt so, maybe it will work, but not because it was the best move.
I'm asking to burgers, what is the position of AOC and omar in all of this? Because I don't think the pro palestine people inside the dems are happy about biden and harris.

TCG tier list for all the major TCGs as of their current state in 2024:

1) Duel Masters
Always a solid option. Core design is immaculate. Duels are short and fun, and very explosive with enough back and forth.

2) Pokemon TCG
Is held back by some really stupid core rules. Prizes are still really dumb design. ND the mulligan rule is equally bad. That aside, the individual design of cards and strategies is decently fun and varied. The artwork on cards is also extremely good.

3) One Piece TCG
A decent alternative to Duel Masters. Nice art on cards, decent meta game, though bad powercreep issues cause if Bandai.

4) Digimon Card Game
Similar pros and cons to One Piece, with better core rules, unfortunately the power creep is starting to make those irrelevant


5) WIXOSS
Fun game, cute girls, decent balance


6) Yu-Gi-Oh Rush Duel
It's Yu-Gi-Oh, but you ACTUALLY get to play. Artwork on cards is good too.


Trash Tier:
Yu-Gi-Oh Master Rules
Rendered unplayable due to extremely poor decision-making from Konami, excessive power creep, and the banlist not being used to balance the game but to push new product

MtG
Somehow worse than Yu-Gi-Oh in every respect. The new release structure means mechanical archetypes don't get fleshed out enough. Just a single set to explore them, before they get dropped. Even standard has been power creeped to shit. Art is ugly and full of DEI. And it's one of the greediest TCGs on the market if not the most. Wizards is so money-hungry they actually put Konami to shame.

I've thought greatly about this and I don't think there is any VP pick that would've been "good"

>Rubio
He's dropped the ball numerous times. Remember him being "water boy" and repeating himself nonstop at the debate. He would've dropped the ball. Plus he's bought and owned. The elites would've definitely taken out Trump for a President Rubio. Also he's done gay bubble parties

>Carson
He's too low energy. He's a smart guy and in line with Trump on issues but he is boring as hell. The media would've played all the nasty things Trump has said about him on the campaign trail in 2016

>Burgum
The left would've painted Trump / Burgum as a group of old white guys telling you what to do on abortion and as being out of touch. 4chan would've been spammed with pics or Burgum hanging out with Bill Gates. People would've made fun of his eyebrows

>Gabbard
Would've been seen as Trump going with DEI pick. The left would've used her to splinter the right voting base by saying she's still a liberal Democrat in disguise and if something happens to Trump she'll push left wing policies. They would've said her and Trump are Russian assets

I'm unaware of anyone that was seriously in contention that would've been the best choice

I heard Vance speak and he's not THAT bad. I think what his weakness is, is that he's not as bombastic and entertaining as Trump and no one ever will be

Especially the rich. Some countries where just stuck with DEI before, but propaganda is a hell of a drug and makes sure not nearly enough whites are put into positions to become such workers now so even if people still want them, there are not nearly enough.

But go look at the races of those flying the richest people on the planet. VERY little DEI for them. Enjoy your competency crisis goy.

>How has everyone managed to just leave the workforce

Honestly, the vast majority of the population hasn't left the workforce and won't be for some time until AGI shows up and corpos replace everything with a sentient robot or whatever. The reality is until that day comes where society has to finally choose between Universal Basic Income for all in a post-labor society, and drastically skewed poverty and wealth, most people will be partaking in the proverbial grind at a job because in our current capitalist system, you have to work to earn a living or take risks via businesses or stocks, or find some arrangement where your skills are traded for time.

Personally, my job makes me sick a bit every morning, but I get up and trudge through it, knowing full and well that I just don't give two shits anymore, i do the job and go home, no worrying and no extra effort unless there's some project that needs doing. If I get fired, I'll just get another job, even burger flipping, I've been poor before and live way below my means, so whatever.

>But the work force seems to be women, convicts and drug addicts these days.

What are you even saying? What line of work are you even in? The workforce is the population on average, filled with idiots, geniuses, and everyone in between. Or are you referring to the Woke™ DEI shit all the corporations are doing? You realize they do that because it's considered the socially polite thing to do. It's a marketing tactic, nothing more. Have you heard how upper management acts and thinks? They do not give less of a fuck about DEI unless you get some foreigners or an SJW New Age type in power.

A little history lesson for you. America opened up its boarders to china in the 1970s, specifically bringing in chinese youth and educating them in our universities. The chinese engineers from china were grown in the usa. Then these engineers went back to china to prep china for globalist outsourcing. China sucked our dicks hard in the 80s, 90s, and 00s. Then the chinese communist party did a coup on itself and purged all the pro-americans, the new Xi regime took control and has remained in control this entire time.

Xi brought china out of the usa' sphere of influence and pushed for having china do things for themselves. The jews were on board and planned a strategic retreat, making china the capital of global homo instead of the usa, this is when the anti-american propaganda started to take off. Then the chinese out jewed the jews!

The americans in response, pivoted to india hard. india is an enemy/competitor of china. Also, the americans had already started building colleges and universities in India in the 90s in order to create a cheap tech labor force (this is why, for apparently no reason at all, all tech support and other low tech workers magically became indians in the 00s).

While the chinese started giving us the finger and openly stealing our technology, the sars greatfully sucked on our zipples and the boomers got fooled by the ever so humble lower castes of india bending over backwards to lick our boots. Little did they know, the indians saw how the chinese made themselves rich fucking us over, and planned to do the same

Now the boomers are so old and retarded that they cant think straight, and theyve created so many self sabotating rules for DEI and the like over the course of their lives they have no idea how to stop it. using nepotism and dei regulations, forigners occupy all our big companies, dual loyalty citizens hold important positions of corporate power, and the rest of us are just suppose to sit there and pretend its normal.

Intel sat on its heels for over a decade and enjoyed its monopoly while the corporation was slowly taken over by know-nothing MBAs and DEI and subsequently rotted from the inside. Now the nearly continuous string of fuckups they've had in CPU design and manufacturing has finally caught up with them, and on top of that their new mediocre GPU business was too late to the AI investment bubble. Investors never gave a shit about any of this until now, when the rot has finally been impacting profits so much that it's now impossible to ignore. There's very little confidence in Intel's ability to keep the gravy train rolling and basically no good news in the short and medium term. Knockoff Chink foundry stuff is largely irrelevant to this particular shitshow, though it could be another factor in the long term that hurts Intel.

lmao this is a fucking cope, at best you'll be working for a noname company with an average corporate lifespan of 5 years as they continue to H1B or EU res.perm-maxx with lower than usual salary + higher taxes. Big companies will hire only top 1% with the rest being JEETs to undercut salaries. You're literally better off trannymaxxing for a DEI HR specialist BS job position and lifemaxxing with spare money from salary than being a cage slave for Mr. Rothstein and ZOG machine donors.

Trump is objectively the favorite right now though. At worst he's equal with DEI Harris in polls right now, but Biden only won by 40k votes across a few swing states in 2020, when he was leading almost all the polls by 5-7%. Trump is the likely winner, and only brainwashed plebbitors in their astroturfed fag subreddits thinks otherwise desu.

That said, always come out to vote. MAGA 2024.

>white man
>not villainmaxxing
NGMI

It has been our observation for many years now that white men have zero political representation. Neither party in the US supports white men, and both are pandering to just about every group except white men. Even in the UK, that Rwandan jogger stabbed a bunch of white children, and the political class there tried to appease Muslims. Our ancestors built the west, but every group except us is given preferential treatment. This attitude does not just exist in politics, with DEI policies at most companies, virtually no one is hiring white men, ESPECIALLY new grads trying to get started in their field. They keep down white men because historically we are effective at standing up to them.

White men, it’s bad but don’t give up, here are some actionable steps. We need to start villainmaxxing. They already treat us like villains just for existing, time to actually embrace being villains. No longer do we begrudgingly uphold a rigged social contract that has been hijacked by Jews with the intent of keeping white men down, fuck that. Every other group uses exploitation and trickery to get ahead, so we do the same. Time to outjew the jews at their own game. Upon seeing the laws and talking to others with this mindset, below is a list of possible ways to LEGALLY exploit the current order for our own gain. These tricks not only work to varying degrees for many people, but make jews and normies seethe for added bonus.

>Lie about your race on a college/job application meant for DEI hires
>Use LEGAL tax loopholes to pay the least amount of taxes or take advantage of the system
>Refuse to serve ZOG
>Debt free living to avoid enslavement to Jew bankers
>Off grid living to be independent of ZOG infrastructure
>Organizing assets like Hakimi so a divorce rape can’t take shit from you
>On a larger scale, white communities splitting off into their own jurisdictions

If you’ve got more lets hear it

the NHS is shit because its built/funded/staffer for 50mil britons, not nearly 70m britons + immigrants

the pharmacist and the nurse is brown because DEI and low wages have pushed the natives out of many professions.

nobody was complaining 30 years ago when immigration existed, but was relatively slow and primarily involved qualified, educated people coming over to work.
its MASS IMMIGRATION that people are complaining about.
especially since nowadays it involves millions of unskilled workers from 3rd world countries, a majority of them military aged males, with appalling cultural norms, and who have no desire to integrate.

it was bad enough when it was millions of eastern europeans, that was enough to cause irreparable economic harm to the lower and working class via wage suppression and increased housing costs. but at least the polandballs could fix a toilet, speak english, and they weren't going around knifing schoolgirls neither.
the recent waves, post brexit, are beyond horrible.

>Trump gave the worst acceptance speech in RNC history and the worst speech of his life. Before this speech even Van Jones on CNN said "The energy at this convention is so high it feels like Obama in 2008". Trump's speech wiped all that energy out.
>picking Vance. He's a charisma void with so much baggage that it's unreal. Any other VP pick would have been better. This pick + Trump's RNC speech destroyed all of his post-assassination momentum
>Joe Biden drops out and Trump was caught off guard. This is insane. The plan for Biden's dropout should have been discussed and executed by Trump and his team. It could have been "I BEAT BIDEN. HE'S RUNNING SCARED!" Instead we got "waaaah! we're gonna sue" and "waaaah we already spent money!"
>Letting Kamala be coronated. Another insane blunder. 2 days after Biden dropped it was 99.9999% Kamala's nomination. Instead of attacking her as a CA liberal (tent cities, open air drug use, open borders, etc) the attacks were "she's a DEI hire" and "she's Indian"
>Trump unfocused. Instead of attacking Kamala he's been attacking Kemp, screaming that Biden will retake the nomination at the DNC, and other idiocy

1. Wall/Border Lockdown/Deportations
2. Complete walk-back of the property and income tax programs.
3. Roll out of broad execution program for all violent criminals that specifically targets nonWhites/pedophiles.
4. Complete withdrawal from every international agreement that requires even $1 US dollar from America.
5. Dismantle the Federal Reserve.
6. Rolling summary trials and executions for every single person who has ever:
A) Taken a bribe
B) Fucked a child
C) Engaged in any form of blackmail
7. A physically enforceable code that purges all diversity/DEI mandates, practices, and philosophies.
8. Hard IQ, credential, AND service requirements for voters. No more of this everyone gets a vote bullshit. This should purge most of the females and nearly all of the blacks from voting.

Boeing is a scapegoat for the half-raceblind Boomers to bellyache about. Yes, it's a DEI-infested MBA shitshow, yes the MAX is a disaster, yes they've already killed hundreds with jeetcode and regulatory deception, but the majority of the blame for most of the recent aviation incidents lies squarely with the jabbed Zoomer-nigger maintenance crews working for the airlines (and potentially trained by Boeing).

Boeing isn't responsible for the spike in engine failures. Boeing isn't responsible for tires falling off of 747s which left the assembly plant fifteen years ago. Boeing isn't responsible for unintelligible nigger controllers arranging planes on a collision course in rap-tempo ebonics. The only reason this narrative has media traction is because the actual explanation, that none of this shit can reliably function without White men, is far more damaging to their anti-White agenda.

Wrong. You're getting fired and replaced by a DEI hire if you open your mouth about DEI hires fucking up and ruining everything. The banks and Blackrock say they want diversity (brown people), and since they own a lot of assets and control what does and doesn't get favorable financial treatment companies fall over themselves trying to meet the DEI / woke / equity demands. The same companies that want hire & fire practices, spy on their workers, treat them like shit and have used diversity in the past to disrupt and sabotage workers so that they don't team up to protest for better wages or benefits, as the management and leadership so greedily does without even having the positive results to back up such an increase in payout.

"Ladies and Gentlemen" is now prohibited Anonymous ID:DxXulqTt Fri 09 Aug 2024 11:26:58 No.477646349  Replies: 38 ViewReport
Quoted By: >>477651121
Over the last few years, Delta Air Lines has embraced the diversity, equity and inclusion agenda under the purview of a chief officer who believes that the phrase “ladies and gentlemen” isn’t inclusive.

Delta’s Chief Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Social Impact Officer Kyra Lynn Johnson has said publicly Delta is striving to “boldly pursue equity” which has impacted every level of the company, from its hiring practices to the language it uses in gate announcements.

“So we’re beginning to take a hard look at things like our gatehouse announcements. You know, we welcome ‘ladies and gentlemen.’ And we’ve asked ourselves, ‘Is that as gender inclusive as we want to be?’” Johnson said during a February 2021 panel with other DEI insiders. “You know, we’re looking at some legacy language that exists in some of our employee manuals. And getting to the root of the way some things are described and saying, ‘Does that actually send a message of inclusivity?’”

Delta released an inclusive language guide in December 2020 which advised employees and leaders against using terms that reinforce the notion that there are only two genders.

Boeing is symbolic of everything wrong with America, you've got a bunch of boomers who want to pay engineers $10 an hour because god forbid we pay what a service or good is worth, then you've got a bunch of fat HR ladies DEI-ing the fuck out of hiring so that nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. The entire airline industry is like this, I know I sound like an angry old man, but even just five years ago it wasn't normal for all the flights in the country to get grounded multiple times a month.

By the way, they now say that they're going to try to get their astronauts down "in early 2025." Hope those two have good life insurance policies.

Japan collapse, legit. They now have lower GDP per capita than Spain, Lithuania and others. All of that while still an insane work culture. Horribly inefficient, ripe to fail.

China collapse also, everything is fake when it comes to their numbers, at the same time men at 25 are considered "too old" for corp.world as they have tons of unemployed that will do it for cheaper and that is with their horrible demographics.
Do not worry, XI will go to war, but not against Taiwan (which he can not pull off) but taking back former chinese territories from Russia and some parts of the North where the ressources are. The most epic back-stab in history....

The Middle East will explode into a warzone with heavy US involvment, DEI military will bear heavy loses and while nobody cares about anyone there ... blocking the shipping route will throw the world into Chaos with Europe most affected.

Funny you should say that. Feds have run stings every 4-6 years on 4chan because the "anonymous" nature causes them to flood out of the woodwork. They're also highly politically motivated since the DEI degeneracy emboldens them to be outspoken, which is why they sting in tandem with election seasons.

I've already seen 4 rounds of pedos get sent to the slammer because they post increasingly graphic stuff because they think it's accepted here like it is on their discards. I know this because the flavor of degeneracy changes with each rounds of stings, coinciding with new people that fell to the dark side.

The hate on libertarians is overrated, I am a white nationalist and the "individual duty" of libertarianism I took 100% unto me. If you dont go overboard with libertarianism, with its monopolies and other jewish nonsense, then its actually a pretty good system.

My ideal system doesnt exist yet, I think I want nothing of the past. The future, if we ever make it there, seem a bigger decentralization, dismantling of all nation states. In favor of no borders/extreme borders (if you make your own city state, town etc. and declare borders). Yet at the same thought I dont think that nation states operate very well with the modern tech society. I think those borders may as well get demolish, in favor of what we would see as guilds, corporations, co-ops for farming, right wing, religious.

The biggest problems that we have had were always white men in this modern age, other white men, left wing men. I hate them more than most browns. They are terrible. So I dont want to have the same laws with them, I dont want to share jackshit with them.

And the internet, with its decentralized promises, its smart contracts...it can provide a better framework to keep an advanced society functioning than a traditional gov does. I think that at some level this non state economy that will come out of that, will be much better than our current system. Non state economies that span the globe, which have weird links to one another. Based on contracts, smart contracts and whatever else arises. It keeps happening that some corpo in the EU has better social contact with some brown nation, for resources or labor, than a gov to gov ever has had.

This would ensure SKILLED migration...if corpos are left to their own devices and they have no jew DEI/ESG breathing down their neck, thats when they actually only hire skilled workers. And such things would achieve national socialism to a fairly good degree as well.

Current influx of shitskins everywhere is an inoculation of western states. If their institutions are good, and locals are virile enough, they would survive an inoculation, shitskins would introduce a bit of their influence, like a virus, and eventually become less harmful, while most harmful shitskin breeds would disappear.

But weak states, with weak institutions, would not survive massive shitskin influx. Can a corporation 'digest' pajeets? is its culture strong enough to do that? When DEI hires started I immediately assumed that it's a way of companies to compete with each other - some can tolerate the poison, but others - can not at all. They lobbies institutionalisation of shitskin hires, to put a pressure on other players, now everyone has to drink shitskin DEI coolaid.

The question is - who is the main Mirthridates here?

DEI is why.

when you're training for war, and now with heightened expectation of war, the "chain is only as strong as its weakest link" aspect of teamwork is essential to war. when you see 20 years of women, niggers and now trannies in uniform, any remaining boyhood dreams of military glory quickly turn into imagining yourself dying in a Three Stooges slapstick tragedy.

even in times of peace, you have to live in cramped spaces with these types for weeks or months at a time during training. imagine the smell.

Nice trips, but Vance was right. Kamala hides from reporters because she's a stupid drunk and can't talk without a teleprompter or script. She has no charisma or charm, she is a DEI hire that sucked cock to get her career. She was a senator for 4 years, Vance was a senator for 2 years. They essentially have a 2 year difference in the length of their political careers. I won't count her disaster of a vice presidency, because she failed to do anything other than allow 20 million illegals flood the country and get gibs. Her poor performance detracts greatly from her credibility.

MrBeast is an engineered movement of White Androcentrism, young boys want to be him, he's an ally for trans-former men and for weird WHITE pdf files as we keep on seeing. I suspect the courts desperately want to stop jailing White men for getting caught liking little girls (news flash: they all fucking do, ding ding ding) because nowadays it's never been easier to catch men being sloppy with their phones and shit and on camera, because they are stupid as fuck, so the evidence is mounting. Families are being destroyed. So many church "leaders" and policemen etc. "their own guys" are getting locked up, essentially. MrBeast philanthropy may be where those guys inevitably get put to work in time. These women who are probably getting paid to promote distancing from MrBeast is just solidifying his male base by making him relatable. Soon he will be forming all-male competitions and rescuing White men from imprisonment and 'changing lives for the better' (as he does) which is exactly what They want. Meanwhile you have Harrison Butker of religious denomination telling young boys, "hey, it's okay to force women into the home and out of jobs <3" and a trad wife movement that is saying "yes, women, that is actually what you do want and you know deep down it's what you want" and it's all actually working lmao. Which, makes sense given how many jobs will be replaced by AI and machines, men are going to in fact need jobs. Then there's that looming reality of how close we are to the discovery of machines that make reproductive sex outdated and a woman unnecessary for men to have children. Who knows, maybe they already discovered that and that's why this is all happening. Women aren't going anywhere and I'm not saying I want them to, but I am thinking of the inevitable and clearly there's a male movement of taking back power. That is why DEI is shoved in your face, because White men are operating from a position of "see? we're the underdog". It makes rallying men easier.

He knew the rocket failed to start a dozen times.

In typical boomer fashion, he didn't care about unemployed young white engineers, he wanted a cheap ticket to achieving his goals.

With that being said, I approve and authorize anyone to take out any tax payer funded rescure ship. This guy needs to die in space. Only a privately funded rescure mission should be allowed to launch.

it is not a single entity. The clubs are decentralized cells. Impossible to combat. The Jews have a state aparatus that permits them to control finance through central control, like an invading army.
Frens must combat this through decentralized, ideologically motivated economic resistance.
Yeah, I know that sounds long winded, but my point is Frens must become an economic Viet Cong. Also, you can't go to jail for it, since it is not yet illegal to have a private understanding between Frens.

Legality is a weapon they use against us. It can serve as a bulwark against them.
Another element, is the amassing of houses outside of their asset book. The Ponzi shcheme of Black rock is to purchase everything and force everyone to rent it back for double or triple. Ideological resistance can forego money made on capital gains, and refocus it towards making our money from our own enterprise. Moreover, the threat of having funding and patronage cut off from other groups of Frens for disloyalty, can incentivize self enforcement. This is the same method used by Blackrock to force people to play ball. However, since there is no broad contract, no central organization or legally binding agreement, it becomes series of people making their own decisions, and becomes harder to combat with centralized force.

The solution to blackrock having monopoly control over houses is owning the thing they intend to rent back to you. The central shell game hinges on them controlling credit. Like in It's a Wonderful Life. We can become a movement of George Baily's while the central ownership is Mr Potter. It also works, because we want our freedom, while the Larry Finks are old and blinded by bitterness. We can outlast them, and their replacements are all DEI know nothings.
The decentralized economic resistance is a much more encouraging mode of resistance than the despair and revence fantasies that glowies and JIDF faggots try to hurt my Frens with.

As an /oldfag/who has lived through bush, Obama, Trump, I can say this.
Trump from 2016 is not Trump from 2020 or 2024.

Trump in 2020, openly gave niggers $500,000,000 in "economic zones", he took his White voters for granted. I bit my tongue and voted for him, but never again.
I won't vote GOP ever again, I am so sick of the BS, the lies, the never ending " vote for us to repeal Obama care, or X", then doing nothing for years.

Trump is doing the same shit in 24, he automatically thinks every White man is voting for him. He openly shills for niggers, kikes, Indians, beaners, but not me (a White man) I am told that I'll have to compete against pajeets, beaners, niggers (DEI is OK for Trump) and it's OK to fuck me, because I'm WHITE!

Trump, Camel cunt, RFK all are open Zionists, who want WW3 with Iran.
No candidate is pro White, none of them say they will help me or my family.

China will definitely be really hard for the west to beat. They alone have more people than all of USA and europe combined. They're not as skilled in battle, but they have a lot more meat shields to expend.
>They're also extremely patriotic, and rabidly hate westerners now, since Xi blamed all their problems on USA. USA DEI mutt troops are simply entitled, and only care about themselves. For a while there were lots of tiktok vids of zoomers, saying that they'd flee to mexico if the draft happened

China has beat USA for high tech weapons, since we regressed and stopped research. While china continued at full speed, knowing the war would eventually come
>But china's leaked military CCP 5yr plan says that conventional weapons won't even be the main part. It'll be cyberwarfare, hacking infrastructure, businesses, etc., to shut down the country. Even down to water treatment plants, the electrical grid, street lights, financial payment systems, etc. Let alone targeted genetic biowarfare. Both are fairly cheap to do, once setup

Along with targeted genetic bioweapons being the other main weapon. As china has the largest genome database on earth, I think something like 2 billion genomes, most illegally acquired. They're doing those kinds of weapons, just as israel has been working on them since before 1996. Israel has the 2nd largest genome database
>So, you won't even know that some things are warfare, vs just horrible events. Things like the next avian flu that becomes lethal in humans and highly infective. Or the next SARS type virus. Some will be used to kill off livestock, so that we don't have meat to eat. Others will just kill lots of people. China has hundreds of illegal biolabs in USA in Canada already, like the cali one that got busted

China is definitely coming out on top after WW3, it's only a question of who they share the global leader status with & if it's simply China on top and everyone lower down, not unlike how USA was top dog for years

I know this is fucked up but the only solution is to let white liberals bear the brunt of dealing with non-white immigrants. They want to virtue signal? Good, live with your pet subhumans.

I have zero pity for any of them or their kids if they get murdered, raped, assaulted, robbed, etc. by the very people they wanted to help.

The more I look at this shitshow, the more I realize we're in the 5th century AD that Rome faced. We're gonna be dealing with Asiatic hordes like the Huns (PRC and their semi-Mongoloid Russkie allies and maybe the North Koreans) that will destabilize and upset Europe and Asia with launching simultaneous attacks at South Korea, Taiwan, and eastern Europe. We can handle 1 or 2, but not all 3 fronts at the same time.

Meanwhile we've got the Germanic barbarian migrations (illegal immigrants from Mexico and the rest of Latin America). They're the ones serving in the US armed forces compared to any other ethnic group. So they're the foedarti. Will we have a Stilicho, Flavius Aetius, Majorian or Odoacer soon?

I've been around these parts for around 20 years at this point and I can tell you with all certainty that this is the most exciting time to be on /pol/ for the last several years.
It's less of a degradation you're seeing, and more that your perspective as anon is growing. Things go through ups and downs, but I remember a time when the shills and glowies were half-decent at their jobs. Now you can spot them (and thus insult them) from a mile away, because they're incompetent DEI hires.
Keep lurking.

It got worse. When I wanted to go home they literally left me in the waiting room and turned the lights off. I was having a massive argument with the patient transport dispatcher mong and she kept fobbing me off with 'oh, they're just leaving now, I'm tracking them now on the system.' I phoned them up again when the paramedics finally showed up and they gave me the same lie, so I yelled down the phone 'they're right here you fucking liar.' The paramedics thought it was funny. Apparently, they were sick of her shit too. DEI hires are a fucking menace.

anon, when the boomers go, TV and the MSM goes.
NOBODY under the age of 60 watches TV anymore, except the sportsball fans. and they aren't sticking around for the news afterwards.
and those of us raised on the internet have been repeatedly and thoroughly exposed to all sorts of shit regarding the jews, be it infographics re: how many positions in the press they occupy, compilations that show the predominantly jewish authorship of pro-immigration laws, or any number of other similar things.

im not exactly the most sociable sort, after all, i am posting here. but even so, my impression is that most people in my age cohort either don't give a fuck about israel, or are antisemitic to some extent.
and yes, the true extremist, the "gas the kikes" people are very rare. but still, i think 30 years from now, the idea that we should send $$$$ to israel to help defend them will seem ridiculous and will be FAR outside the overton window. nevermind putting boots on the ground and fighting for them.

best the jews can hope for is that the current support for multi-culti and wokeness/CRT/DEI and stuff continues (EXTREMELY unlikely, if it does, there will be civil wars everywhere within a couple decades) and they can maintain their status as a protected class in western democracies. but isreal? nobody will give a shit about it, and if they do its because they want it wiped out.

1. Homogeneous society - no Jew shit
2. High Trust Society - low crime, high convenience, well run, etc.
3. Socially conservative - while feminism is there, it is generally a minority opinion.
4. Great entertainment
5. Prostitution is legal

And if you already work a fuckton, Japanese society is the same.

Contrast that with the west:
1. DEI shit
2. Low Trust Society, everything tagged, borked, broke, or crumbling
3. Degenerate society
4. Shit entertainment
5. Prostitution is illegal

The only thing bad about Japan is firearms are illegal, which isn't a big deal because of the low crime rate. Obviously chuds forget about the racism shit there, but they tolerate whites way better than blacks.

Reminder that boomers love DEI because they hate having competent employees who will back sass them. Tyrants love putting women and dumb niggers in charge of things so they can run their companies like feudal lords. If Stockton Rush's company was full of smart White guys with MIT degrees they would have all called him a deranged lunatic.

If there is one thing boomers fucking hate it's White millenial and zoomer males telling them that they're wrong. It reminds them of their own impending morality. They see these vital young men and see their own bygone youth mirrored in them. They hate being reminded that they are moribund dinosaurs from the 20th century. So instead they surround themselves with the least competent people on earth to restore a shred of their diminished vitality.

DEI is part of a larger anti- competency movement where the 1% psychopaths at the top can consolidate even more power and money for themselves with zero pushback. These people are not money optimizers, they optimize for power and control.

>white man
>not villainmaxxing
NGMI

It has been our observation for many years now that white men have zero political representation. Neither party in the US supports white men, and both are pandering to just about every group except white men. Even in the UK, that Rwandan jogger stabbed a bunch of white children, and the political class there tried to appease Muslims. Our ancestors built the west, but every group except us is given preferential treatment. This attitude does not just exist in politics, with DEI policies at most companies, virtually no one is hiring white men, ESPECIALLY new grads trying to get started in their field. They keep down white men because historically we are effective at standing up to them.

White men, it’s bad but don’t give up, here are some actionable steps. We need to start villainmaxxing. They already treat us like villains just for existing, time to actually embrace being villains. No longer do we begrudgingly uphold a rigged social contract that has been hijacked by Jews with the intent of keeping white men down, fuck that. Every other group uses exploitation and trickery to get ahead, so we do the same. Time to outjew the jews at their own game. Upon seeing the laws and talking to others with this mindset, below is a list of possible ways to LEGALLY exploit the current order for our own gain. These tricks not only work to varying degrees for many people, but make jews and normies seethe for added bonus.

>Lie about your race on a college/job application meant for DEI hires
>Use LEGAL tax loopholes to pay the least amount of taxes or take advantage of the system
>Refuse to serve ZOG
>Debt free living to avoid enslavement to Jew bankers
>Off grid living to be independent of ZOG infrastructure
>Organizing assets like Hakimi so a divorce rape can’t take shit from you
>On a larger scale, white communities splitting off into their own jurisdictions

Because right after the assassination attempt happened Israel First sayan Trump and his jewed up shitlib family put on that absolutely obscene terrible show at the RNC, totally killing all of the positive energy. Fucking Indian witchcraft spell. Token niggers 4 Trump. Aliens invaders who can't speak English and should be deported 4 Trump. Onlyfans snowbunny nigger skank satanists with face tattoos 4 Trump. Vice President Palantir. Staple Green Cards to the diplomas of alien invaders. Time to finance another war for our greatest parasite, Israel.

We got the message loud and clear. Fuck White Christians, fuck White Men, we are the gay jewish DEI party now.

Trump is being sabotaged by his campaign who have convinced Trump to whore himself seeking the votes of everyone who will not be voting for him instead of increasing the intensity of his own voting base, which worked in 2016. At the same time, a lot has changed since 2016. Trump's base is much further to the right and politically aware than they were in 2016. Everyone is aware of the jewish problem. Trump shitting on Project 2025 made it clear that the next administration intends to accomplish nothing and Trump has capitulated.

I can't make this anymore clear. We don't give a fuck about Israel. The primary concern is demographic obliteration, economic pain, and not being slaves to the illegal unregistered foreign agent AIPAC that has hijacked our government.

Non-White people are not going to vote for Trump. Trump needs to focus on preserving and empowering his White male voting base.

Demonkike Mayorkas and his DEI hires nearly killed the president with criminal negligence. The IC is going to manipulate all of the polls and steal the next election. Instead of anticipating this problem and rallying his base to stand strong, Trump's campaign is burning their base of support.

You've shit the bed. What is there to meme? Fealty to Israel and "legally" flooding our country with aliens?

No, people are just easily distracted away from ever looking to policy solutions when even corporations point to lack of policy as the reason train derailment and power grid failures and wild fires happen. A company just has to say "we worked within the state's guidelines" and wash their hands of anything that happens because of corners they cut.

That want you to civil war because the civil war isn't over forcing government to have stronger regulations, to hold companies accountable, it's more likely to be about ESG, DEI, and jews because that's easier to understand and doesn't make you a socialist commie faggot.

Jeet labor, jeet code, jeet management, jeet accounting. What did you expect, niggers? I'm dubbing this right here and now: /pol/'s Law of Diminishing Return.

A company, like Boeing, exists because it was built by White men. All its great success over th decades was because of White men. Recently, however, the company replaced its management, its engineers, its low-level staffers, all with DEI hires and foreign labor. Why? Because they save money on expenses and thus their quarterly earnings look better to investors.

Here's the problem with that:
At some point, at any company, someone has to do some actual work. Boeing makes very highly engineered products requiring a lot of expertise. Expertise which the new workforce does not have. Thus their products fail. Thus they lose money, prestige, and their stock prices go down. Boeing went all in on DEI and jeet-staffing, and now their company is in collapse because the strength of the White men who actually did their jobs is now too little to force back the incorrigible weight of jeet-labor. Boeing will continue to collapse because they can't even fire the people destroying them from within, now. Therefore, in their lust for fractions of a percent on their stock price, they committed suicide as a company.

The idea that there are certain demographics that need multiple boxes to stand on to be at the same level as the people who need no boxes while saying for decades that everyone is equal and has the same amount of value is demeaning, not to mention that it's those who need no boxes that are expected to fund it.

Honest question, if you are black, or any sort of minority that is widely viewed as "lesser than" white people, how do you feel about DEI and other equity ideas? If I were black I would see it as demeaning and dehumanizing.

>They're people, like you and me.
No, they're a bunch of retards. I can rather simply explain what the problems are in plain language. And I'm a fucking carpenter. What I see in front of me is 50 years of nepotism and enforced DEI hiring chaperoned by the most greed driven caste, who have been allowed to buy and sell everything our country had for their own profit. And when they lost everything, we printed money and gave it back to them. Fuck them all. Let it burn to the ground.

Trump's only utility was making people mad, and I found that funny. Without solid people backing him up and creating solid policies, he never could achieve anything. Which is why he never did. I agree everything is theater, he never stopped being a reality tv star. Politics is just reality TV. That's why we argue about blacks and gays instead of talking about economic policy, the deficit, the national debt, trade deals, etc.

You're talking about "equity", the word hiding the the middle of DEI. Equity, or equality of outcome, is another way of saying that everyone will:

Live in the same style of tent
Eat the same bug gruel
Drive the same scooter (literally because there's just one for the whole village)
Make the same wage
etc etc

Did you think it meant everyone gets to be rich and have nice things? Get out of here.

>Nobody asked for it and nobody wants it
Only one person in the US truly wants it and is asking for it and his name is Larry Fink. Larry Fink is the spearhead of DEI, and he enforces DEI by using BlackRocks immense wealth and connections to get banks to refuse to give loans to companies they deem "politically incompatible". Large game developers pay their payroll with those loans because while they are developing video games they are making no money, it is only after the game releases for pre-order do they get any cash flow.

This is how DEI is enforced.

It's because of America. Because of dei and esg writers have decided that everytime they make some kind of media they're putting their own personal politics in there. Nobody asked for it and nobody wants it but they just do it anyway. They believe they're correcting people's behavior and influencing them. Here in the uk only weirdos talk about politics when there isn't a big election or referendum coming up. I only keep up with what's going on in politics cos Im involved with glowies from around the world. I wish people who wrote games, tv shows and films realised they can make original content full of gays and trannies and don't have to shoehorn it into everything they can. I think it's cause no body would watch an original TV shows about black lesbian trannies but if they shove them in the middle of star wars then the people will have to put up with it. I can't remember what is was but I was watching something and for no reason whatsoever there was a single line about "straight white males", no one fucking cares. Just make interesting shit again. Use good actors and write interesting shit.

Be suspicious of any archeological findings above 20,000 years, especially when they use animal remains to carbon date. The reason for this is that the decaying/radioactive isotope carbon 14, it only has a half life of 5,730 years. And, more importantly it's impossible to know at the time of death of the creature/person how much carbon 14 was in its body.

All of this butt triggers modern DEI lab workers, so they cite a tree ring study in order to get around it. And they use "approximate date ranges" to avoid their "study" being called guess work.

Reminder that boomer love DEI because they hate having competent employees who will back sass them. Tyrants love putting women and dumb niggers in charge in things so they can run their companies like feudal lords. If Stockton Rush's company was full of smart White guys with MIT degrees they would have all called him a deranged lunatic.

This but its not DEI. They can only hire bottom of the barrel workers because they wont pay enough for anyone except niggers and trailer trash to work for them. Manufacturing jobs in the US used to mean you were middle/upper middle class, now factory workers require government assistance and a two income household to even survive. Pay chink wages get chink results.

Listen you weak girlyman.
Im 10 years younger than you.
I own my home and land and purposefully moved to not pay taxes to child molesters.
I routinely disrupt DEI and drive people either to our side or out of my life.
I dont buy ad sponsored anything, dont use social media, dont stream, game, or give money to pedophile music/movie industry.
My sons are right wing and Christian and are behibd me 100% because I love them and spend time while instilling discipline and ethics while not being a psycho tyrant.
My wife is on my side because I didnt date or interact with shit left women who are sociopaths.
I own several firearms and thousands of rounds of ammo.
I vote hard right and get involved in local politics so faggot pedophike Foucalt acolytes get wrecjed trying to infiltrate.
Same with my church, whom I donate 10% to when not funding legal defenses of based men and pols I believe in.
I read and understand the lefts arguments and routinely destroy them publically and without fear.
And Im unafraid.
So cope more faggot. Sit on your ass and do nothing. But dont project yoyr weakness on others. You are reaponsible, either lead, standup behind the right, or die. Time to choose. Good luck.

It's really hard to express how big of a fuckup this is. I know zoomers are too young to remember, but back in 2019 and before it wasn't common for all the flights in the country to randomly go down two or three times a month, the DEI hiring of the Biden years is going to set back aeronautics and space by decades. Boeing uses $10 an hour engineers, the guy making your big mac has more training and resources put into him than Boeing's spacecraft design team.

It's all juda-ism in the end:

Lastly, President Kennedy began to end the Vatican's hoax known as "the Cold War," the American CIA and Russian KGB having secretly worked together since World War II. He also began to end that Jesuit Inquisition in Vietnam, as its future highpoint would be "Operation Phoenix," the CIA mass-murder of 60,000 Vietnamese, "in cold blood" according to its Opus Dei Director, William E. Colby.

The President interfering with Rome's Holy Office of the Inquisition could not be tolerated! Millions of "infidel" Buddhists were to be exterminated, the Pope's International Drug Trade would explode, American patriotism and liberty would further be destroyed and Vietnam would be reunited under Ho Chi Minh— another communist military dictator loyal to the Pope— like Stalin, like Chairman Mao, like Castro, like George H. W. Bush and son. Waged under the guise of opposing the communist empire's "domino effect," Cardinal Spellman championed America's most disastrous conflict known as "Spelly's War" overseen by Spelly's General, the Roman Catholic and CFR member, William C. Westmoreland. (Remember, according to Col. L. Fletcher Prouty in his JFK, the forced movement of over 660,000 Roman Catholics on U.S. Navy transport vessels from North Vietnam into South Vietnam was "one of the root causes of the Vietnam War." The arch-Catholic Secretary of the Navy responsible for implementing that Jesuit-agitation was the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Francis P. Matthews. Knight Matthew's Master was America's "Military Vicar," Francis Cardinal Spellman.

Later, Spellman made several visits to the war-front calling the American troops "the soldiers of Christ," fighting the Pope's Crusade against "godless Jew Communism!") The outcome was 58,000 dead, 130,000 post-war suicides and a 500 billion-dollar debt to the Jesuits' Federal Reserve Bank.

Management technology is as much technology as pottery, animal husbandry, or the calendar, and is more technology than giant death robots by virtue of being real (so far). Boeing's choice of management technology, for whatever various reasons, is obviously failing and failing hard.

I wonder what will happen when all the whites in Europe that simp for gross immigrants can’t get a job. I wonder what will happen when they say Taylor swift is Haram. I wonder what will happen when white women are routinely openly raped by gross pakis. I wonder what will happen when they realize European women can’t dress like whores anymore. I wonder what will happen when abortion is completely banned in Europe because Muslim men control women. I wonder what will happen when beating your wife is legal. I wonder then if I will shed a tear for my “race”. Prolly not, I hate white people just as much as all the gross lazy immigrants now, if not even more. You all are traitors, uncle Tommies to be exact, and I’m just excited to watch the joy of DEI turn to fear and regret. In the US all major cities are crumbing from blacks. ME Muslims are worse by leaps and bounds. My buddy in Afghanistan found a 9 year old raped so many times in a junkyard at night that their medic suggested shooting her in the head for mercy. Just another day as a 9 year old girl in the great ME! Good news is a lot of you incels will thrive under sharia law, you’ll get child brides and get to do whatever. If they object, you’ll simply knock their teeth out and fuck one of your many children wives! I wonder if then the lefties will admit they were wrong like the jab? Or are you just gonna stay quiet too once you know you’re wrong again? We’ll see, enjoy your diversity, the jab took 15 years off your life expectancy, DEI will take another 15.
