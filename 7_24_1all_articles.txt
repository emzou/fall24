Important info on Greg:
He most likely did covert ops before. Around the same time he “shot himself by accident” in 2019 undercover narcotics officers with the PA OAG engaged a suspect with gunfire, killed him, but were injured. Names of the officers not released to not blow cover. The attorney general back then was Josh Shapiro, the anti trump Dem governor of PA. Is there truly a connection between them? As governor he controls the state police. You need some local cooperation in glowops like this.
Earlier in the video, local cops count 5 shell casings. Then this glownigger shows up. After that they count 8. From audio analysis, shots 1, 2, and 3 were slow and steady. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are rushed. Then 9 is the final one which takes out crooks.
Working theory: FBI grooms patsy crooks. Some loner or loser, maybe he got in trouble for something, maybe they did the fake gf thing, parents are therapists. Either way, he was set up ahead of time, social media scrubbed before the shooting. If he had a libtard posting history a civil war could kick off. According to one senator or congressman at one recent hearing, he had heard that the family house was scrubbed clean like a lab. My thinking is that cooks was clearly set up. Let in somehow. Probably assigned the retard DEI D team but put people who knew about the plot in charge. Investigate people giving weird orders. Professional sniper somewhere else, perhaps as in pic rel. Maybe crooks was spotted too soon before getting into position that the pro had to hurry his shots. Cops arrested kids hours before they gave that fake statement to the media. ATF were the two grey suits. Gave out a number with a 215 area code. Look at the recent activities and location of any glowies nearby, especially Philly and Pittsburgh. May be significant that they tried in PA, where Biden’s circle has connections.

I'm all too familiar with street-shitters and their driving habits in Brapton.
I swear the 15 living in 3 bedroom house meme is obviously real because you can look at the 3 cars in the driveway and 4 more all parked in front of every house because they have their grandmother from India living in the garage. Brapton is the main cause of the terrible traffic in the GTA because every street-shitter drives a car to timmies then to their warehouse job at Amazon.

There must be a a dozen pajeet diversity hires in the banks and dealerships that are giving these uninsured dalits car loans and mortgages through DEI programs. Or because they pool their incomes the household net looks high and they get the preferential loans

While I had good memories at the start, not even 4 years later it turned into a DEI shitfest with everything banned, forced acknowledgement of country speeches for every powerpoint presentation, and immigrants killing the culture we once had. Plus, benefits are much worse now than 10 years ago.
Recruiting can't even meet half of 50% of their quota, which is why we now allow non-citizens to join.

You would think and certainly possible. But what if the DEI competency crisis has infected even these scumbags. Could be their “How to Assassinate the President” handbook is out of date since the 80s. Maybe there was some other fuckup. They really were eager to blow Trump’s head to mist in slow motion 4K on live TV to kill his legacy, humiliate his followers, and then Jan 6 style crackdown on everyone who engages in civil unrest. Maybe a coup like Erdogan where you use it to imprison all the regimes enemies. They might have been too eager for his blood and got launch fever. I actually think God might have intervened directly with how he turned his head at the last moment.

To be fair, many of the jeets are also low IQ retarded, but the Jews like them as golems and they are rapidly taking over by infiltrating major western companies through DEI recruitment.
Especially in a nation like Sweden, this is bound to happen, or has already been happening.
Even if the Somalis have no intention of doing so, the Jews and their leftists under their influence love the humiliation ritual of giving important positions to people they really believe are inferior.
I wonder why the Swedes don't feel threatened and believe that they will be left with some kind of white zone.

It's a terrible cope that the only reason people complain about immigration is because they're afraid of being cuckolded.
It is easy to imagine that people whose skin color is different from yours will be elevated to unjustly high social positions by the DEI, and will cronyistically recruit others of the same skin into their ranks, who will eventually seize power in society and start getting rid of you from important positions.
But you say, "I'm better off anyway because I get to have sex with women, unlike you incels", is that really okay?
Is it still okay because you can have sex while the city is being ravaged by more and more crime and public sector cronyism and corruption by the day?

Astroturfed, like you're seeing now with Kamala, except he's a more polished turd than Kamala is. And smartphones and social media were just coming on the scene, and Tik Tok wasn't around yet, which helped keep out some of the garbage we now get flooded with. The Smith-Mundt act wasn't amended either until about mid-Obama presidency, so that also kept out the propaganda for awhile under Obama. The economy imploded, but they hadn't quite started using the magic money printer to boost up DEI garbage. So as awful as it was, it was still better than what we'd have if Kamala's ass ends up behind the Resolute desk and better than what we have now. But it was the beginning stages of how many things are now.

>Kamala Harris's record as a prosecutor is marked by her unwavering dedication to justice and reform.
LOL. San Francisco is extremely unsafe and it has one of the highest amounts of human feces on the streets in the USA. Unsafe and disgusting. Doesn't even prosecute streetshitters.
>As District Attorney of San Francisco, she was a trailblazer in pioneering innovative programs that aimed to reduce recidivism and provide second chances, particularly for non-violent offenders.
That's an oxymoron and yes that's why it's unsafe, because she doesn't want to give criminals proper sentences.
>Harris’s approach included the establishment of the Back on Track program, which offered vocational training and education to help formerly incarcerated individuals reintegrate into society and break the cycle of crime.
There's still lots of crime in San Francisco so it didn't fucking work.
>In her role as California’s Attorney General, Harris took significant steps to address systemic issues within the criminal justice system. She championed policies to combat human trafficking,
But she doesn't care about illegal sales of fetal body parts
>secured substantial settlements against major corporations for consumer protection, and led efforts to reform practices that disproportionately impacted marginalized communities.
Niggers still commit the majority of crime there so her bullshit DEI reforms clearly didn't work.
>Harris’s tenure also saw her push for measures to increase transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies. Kamala Harris has consistently demonstrated a commitment to fairness, equity, and the pursuit of a justice system that serves all people.
Nothing fair and just about not prosecuting Planned Parenthood officials when they brag about selling fetal body parts

Its both. they're both malicious and incompetent. When you didn't do your homework in school what did you say? Some version of i forgot my homework at home. Pretending to incompetence is the most common way people hide their malice. It's why immediately following the shooting the media went on a full blitz to blame it on the incompetence of the secret service. If they're just incompetent then they're not culpable for conspiring to assassinate trump. Thats the cover up, and honestly i'm amazed that cheatle went up to congress and was so defensive instead of playing up her presumed incompetence. You can tell thts what some of the congressmen were there to do, help her frame the narrative that she's a dei hire who don't know no better. And thats the real kicker, the fact that she couldn't play act with them to convince the public that the secret service is just understaffed and not very good at their jobs proves that she and the other conspirators are actually incompetent. They did try to kill trump, but they fucked it up and fucked up the cover up and she was forced to resign the day after the hearing because of her incompetent performance in covering it up.

Go watch TIKhistory on youtube. He has the best analysis on political systems.
However in my view you base politics on if the sysgem is contrilled by Jews or not. For example Russian communism was really Jewish Fscism. But Stalin purged most Jews and Russian communis became gentile communism. Western capitalism is Jewish Fascism. But if gentiles take it over then capitalism is labled white supremacist Fascism. If socialism is Cojtrolled by Jews for Jews then it js Jewish Fascism but if Hitler does it its Racist Fascism. The difference in systems is nobody ever calls oit thr Jewish fascism because Jews hide it behind their social Justice gaslighting. for example, Jews use DEI to force whites out of their jobs but never Jews. DEI is just cover for Jewish Supremacist Fascism. See pic

The games made by teams full with straight, Asian males are still good. The issue is that the DEI has ruined the industry in so many ways.

A great example for that is CDPR. The team, which made The Witcher 3 was 99% straight, white, male and Polish. And they made a great game. Right now their dev team is more diverse than some Californian studios somehow. Females with no skills, but weird pronounces and bright hair colors are now the average workers there. And Cyberpunk 2077 represents this quite well. I am afraid for The Witcher remake and The Witcher 4. We will probably see a "black bvll" instead of Geralt. Or Ciri might become lame, gay and black. Who knows what those freaks would even do this time.

I refuse to purchase a game, that is not made by either a full straight, white male team or full straight, Asian male team. Diversity can die in a ditch.

The good news are, that the Koreans are starting to emulate Japan in yet another thing - two of the latest Korean games were basically a side grade of their Japanese counterparts (Stellar Blade and Nier), (Lies of P and Sekiro/BB).

Meanwhile the West continues to produce slop, starring George "Yasuke" Floyd - the strongest samurai to ever live and the ruler of Wakanda.

Nothing will be fixed until the DEI funding stops and the games start to be made by skilled, passionate white and/or Asian men.

Eh,no. I wouldn't say that. They are so advanced that now they are gimped by chinese mentality and chinese culture, not by any technological gap. Westerners are gimped by jewish culture (christianity and its many marxist offsprings) and jewish mentality (such as DEI) and will inevitably lose any advantage.


Just look at their new solid state lithium batteries. These will not only be a commercial success as they age slowly and are difficult to set on fire, they will also boost chink diesel sub performance and chink electric torpedoes. The west have nothing comparable.

This makes sense, like the rest of the Anglo world our economy is hyper financialized and there's no genuine interest in industrial development
Boomers just sort of forgot the foundations of the economy and are living off the equity created from international richfags pumping their money into our housing market
The problem is finance is not innately productive, its meant to provide capital for productive enterprise, not supplant that productivity for financial speculation
But you can make a lot of make-work jobs for DEI purposes in finance that wouldn't be possible in a productive industry like resource extraction or manufacturing, so it fits like a glove

It's gotten bad in the manufacturing sector as well. Everybody is saying it's the rank-and-file workers and DEI, but rank-and-file workers in the manufacturing industry have always been DEI.

It's DEI, immigration, and outsourcing.

They want to bring third worlders in to subvert the domestic labor market and depress wages. They also like "diversity" because it lowers in-group preference and reduces risk of unionizing.

The FBI has become so incompetent that real law enforcement will not play nice with these cunts. The FBI has lost its' credibility and should be disbanded.

The FBI is a political enforcement arm of the White House and is more concerned with hiring niggers, trannies, faggots and other assorted retards that have no skills except being mentally ill.

"The picture that emerges of the FBI is of an incompetent, arrogant, bloated bureaucracy that includes a new generation of DEI hires described as “completely worthless” and “the worst batch of people.”

The dei movement really has affected education. Chinese gun powder? Do you learn your history from television?
The greeks traded with ancient cathay, and one of the things they sent east was Greek Fire (the precursor to gunpowder). The Chinese took this civilization founding technology and turned it into pretty lights for 1000 years.
Whites went through a nadir on the civilization cycle, then we came back and found the east had kept the secrets of gunpowder and traded it back to us
We rapidly turned this childrens toy into world conquering weapons.

Over the majority of our evolution, women in real danger conflict always power down and stick their butts into the air to offer to he who remains after the deathmatch.

As a result, the person who, all else being equal, if superior to deciding what is best for tribe, is the male because at every stage of our evolution a male is selected for winning, wheras the women is selected for starting fights that lead to deathmatches, and picking the he who remains.

Being liberal, at its core, is ultimately about not having faith in yourself or those around you (i.e. your community). It's about a lack of faith in your family, your future, your efforts, your intelligence, your work ethic, your determination, your drive.

Being liberal is a state of arrested development; it's honestly sad seeing people sixty years old still shrieking like a hormone-laded teenager, cheering on a DEI-affirmative action worthless human being because she sort of, kind of, looks black. Close enough right? Like a tranny. Close enough.

Can you imagine being a sixty year old man and acting like a 15 year old girl who just discovered politics? Why are liberals so immature? Did something break in their brains? Is it the stress from living in cities and constantly pretending it's actually fun?

Being liberal is about removing the ability for people to act-- it's about preventing people from actualizing, so you don't feel bad about your own lack of actualization. It's about infantalization, it's about immaturity, it's about lack of responsibility; ultimately, it's about lack of faith.

Liberalism -- It's the hope someone else will do the hard work for you and you'll get credit too. Like all those school projects you leached off of. Just like that. Do you understand why they dislike you yet? Will you ever?

Everyone who is paying for AAA video games at this stage is goyim cattle.
The higher the budget, the greater the dependence on unlimited DEI money and the more and more shitty slop that will result from the intervention of the DEI political officers hired as a condition for this.
Also, the Jews realized that one live service slop hit would make more shkel than 10 solid kino's, so they're going to try to make it all live service, not caring if it fails and many development studios close.
Give it up already, capitalism has won.

> Kamala Devi Harris[a] was born in Oakland, California,[14] on October 20, 1964.[15] Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a Tamil Indian-American
> Kamala Harris's father, Donald J. Harris, is Jamaican American of Afro-Jamaican ancestry.
> Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan met at a college club for African-American students (which Shyamala was invited to join).

She's a pajeet-nigger. The ultimate mix to success in USA. She can cry racism whenever she wants, is from protected nigger class worshipped in jewish media and is a pajeet that amerimutts for some reason perceive as smart. No wonder she's DEI hire everywhere:

> She began her law career in the office of the district attorney (DA) of Alameda County, before being recruited to the San Francisco DA's Office and later the city attorney of San Francisco's office. In 2003, she was elected DA of San Francisco. She was elected attorney general of California in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. Harris served as the junior U.S. senator from California from 2017 to 2021

god I hope she wins and USA will turn into even bigger shit

> As a senator, Harris advocated for strict gun control laws, the DREAM Act, and federal legalisation of cannabis, as well as healthcare and taxation reform

It was a massive blunder to toss Biden. Harris could have been preserved as a CA Senator or representative for years to come. Maybe even a Governor. Now, she’ll be lucky to get her old job back.

People are going to point to Harris as DEI blowing up in the DNC’s face and that’s true but the real DEI failure is the current DNC Chair, Jaime Harrison (picrel), and his abundance of strategic missteps in leading his party this year.

I do feel that he was stuck with Vance, similar to Pence out of necessity to appeal to the poor Evangelical Christians of the interior and such. Have to ride the tide, like Biden selecting a DEI. This cycle, Trump needed the neocon, young face with a supposedly conservative yet 'modern' family values.

As for the attempt, I feel that it was outside of Trump completely, he perhaps knew of threats, from inside and outside. If Trump died, the GOP would have attributed it to Iran or the likes, and justify the spending and warmongering of the past. Perhaps Trump was looking for populist appeal and promises kept, however couldn't get past the Jewish lobby, and we will see him pander to the Jews and Israel even more, ie his scheduling to meet with Netanyahu. Between willingness to expose some of the deep state and undo a lot of their agenda, Trump brushed upon things too close for comfort to them.

Trump will likely be stuck having to abide by the rules, and I believe that January 6 put him in his place to (them) about riling up the populace about the corruption.

He knows that if he goes too far off the reservation that they will take care of him. His assassination would be much less risky and much easier to pull off for the flounder intelligence agencies.

These are the people who helped make 9/11 a reality. Clearly, DEI isn't doing them any favors.

Prove it nigger. If that were the case, AMTRAK would be a shining example, but it fucking sucks. There's no net benefit to tossing MORE money into a nigger burnpit. It would only make nigs get to baltimore faster to buy and sell drugs.

Take whoever's money you're stealing and put it into white schools having flight lessons and maybe some aircraft company that isn't owned by China or has DEI to design an affordable personal plane and renew a robust private flight system that we had before regulations out the ass. 16 year old kids were flying their dad's crop dusters in the 1930s.

The only time she was tried and tested was in the 2020 primaries that she failed miserably. Piggybacking on Biden's ticket as the DEI rep is not genuine support, she was a faceless carrot on a stick, and even that nearly failed if they didn't use covid to rig that election. She will get smoked by Trump in a debate and there's no data on how the public perceives her alone. I don't know how people are rationalizing it any other way. She is like a brown female Jeb.

I've been listening to Derek Slatton's Dead America stories on youtube and it's pretty comfy, some of the older stories are based, though the newer nes are more DEI, but he wrote hundreds. The good stories are "Car 37" New York Cops, "Red Eye" flight into small town, "The Motel" with illegals causing trouble, "Ground Zero" in Texas. The Dead Texas series, on one hand there is a red-haired Girl Boss -- but well, she is a police officer into boxing, and she's battle smart but not other kinds of smart, that goes to a black guy who is there briefly -- and one of the heroic character is a skinhead who got nazis tattoos in prison, but he's not racist or even politically incorrect. The DEI stories to avoid is "The Old Man", a boring story about a black old man..."The Hotel" has a heroic hispanic that I felt had a plot armour, but it's not too unbearable, and stuff he did made sense, it's not unrealistic that he could be observant smart. "Brooklyn Bodega" got another girl boss but she's fighting with a yung guy -- Dead America isn't the kind of series where the presence of a Girl Boss meant that the men around has to be useless and/or evil -- it feels very 1990s. The BEST Dead America stories are generally the ones that took place on Day Zero, like The Birthday Party or The Nurse.

We need to go back to that. They were super clever to outlaw segregation (and then later to force integration), because left to our own devices we would separate completely from the niggers and they would openly and obviously fail (as they have, always and everywhere, without affirmative action, DEI or other subsidies and support from jews) so there would be very little doubt who is superior. They can't have that, they must muddy the waters instead (pun intended).

But the tide is turning. And sadly there's really nothing they can do about fixing it at this point. These games are too dependent on dialogue to redo everything in time.

The DEI shit is a superficial problem. The real problem started in GTAV: Moralizing. Carl Johnson didn't run around pretending to be a good caring guy under his criminal mask like Michael, Trevor, and...whatever the fuck the black guy's name was. See that right there? That's the joke: I can remember Carl's name but it just took me the time from writing "Trevor" to this specific sentence to remember it was Franklin.

The characters are boring because they try to moralize them. That just grows DEI shit on top of itself, a symptom of the problem. Stop fucking preaching right and wrong to me. Go back to taking snipes at everyone and everything. Listen to VCPR on a fucking loop and try to realize that the older games written by far better authors took shots at every-fucking-body.

part 2
The reality is that minorities have it worse because they are by nature not compatible with hypermodern civilizations, they never built them, they cannot maintain them. Such incompatibility stems from genetics, a subject of reality leftists hate to even look at. This is one reason why equity is wrongly practiced in DEI.


>– Inclusion is respecting everyone’s voice and creating a culture where people from all backgrounds feel encouraged to express their ideas and perspectives.
A lot of "voices" are completely valueless or detrimental to civilization. Often because they don't have the faculties to understand what is valuable or not. It would be like respecting a child's opinion on the same level as an adult, just because "all should be included", but we obviously don't include children's "voices" when we make decisions that affect society or in general, because they are undeveloped humans with very limited understanding and knowledge.
Most people are average, with average knowledge and understanding. It is very unwise to treat everyone's opinion as if they have the same quality. A more extreme example would be pedophiles, should they be included as well? Do you yourself set a line for whos voice you can not respect? Very few people actually have something of value to say, opinions are not created equal, we should only listen to the best. In short, inclusion is bad because it promotes average minds and accepts terrible opinions as equal in worth to brilliant opinions.


>Please clarify for CNN what you meant by calling Kamala a DEI candidate
She has support not because of her merit, but because she is a black/Indian woman.
Also, from what I wrote in my posts, being a DEI candidate is not a good thing at all.

Your description is exactly what's wrong with DEI.
Exposure to different ideas is a good thing only if you can analyze those ideas and adopt them IF they're better.

DEI by its nature "embraces" and "respects" the difference for the sake of "fairness," regardless of utility. It just dilutes the government and therefore country with shitty stuff that we have to put up with, despite it being shitty, less we be labeled a bigot, and we have to deal with the economic or cultural costs.

Also packed with jeets (generally the rich second-gens so not as unbearable) and especially chinks. The school itself is big on the DEI and diversity shit, but besides that, the quality of education is top-notch, especially in engineering.

Oh, thanks for asking. DEI has nothing to do with any of your definitions. It has to do with driving white people out of positions of power and replacing them with "minority" candidates almost without respect to qualifications. Kamala is a DEI candidate because she failed to win even a single delegate in the 2020 election, was polling at roughly 2% support, had to suspend her campaign as a complete failure... and THEN... was catapulted all the way up to Biden's VP because she was a half-black woman. This is a quintessential example of DEI.

Meetings, email chain, "what's your availability for next Thursday look like for this task that would only take 2 minutes to complete" . I just toss the ball back into DEI's court and repeat. There are so many useless people (women, jeets, negros, spics) as project admins, product managers, external support, 3rd party devs. All worthless and barely productive.
So I stopped busting my ass too. I don't take on extra work. I don't begin infrastructure initiatives. It's a stupid waste of time.

Kamala isn't smart enough to figure it out. She's not smart enough to put together this astroturf internet campaign either.

They're really not. Yasuke isn't beloved in Japan or anything but there have been manga and anime about him already and it was no big deal. All the rage originated with a few right wing weebs who started treating Ubisoft's shitty franchise game like it was some medieval manuscript preserved for centuries until DEI came along and ruined it. Then some Japanese nationalists picked it up and ran with it.

Projects that have been started recently still need to be finished but new products will start to be more targeted to their original audiences. Don't be fooled though, they still hate you guts.

this i think is likely, but FAR from certain.
they get the DEI brownie points for the party and give her the incumbent advantage
the negative here is that it implies that they concede that biden is unfit, which makes them look bad for allowing him to stay on so long.

Credentialism is how they implement "meritocracy." Especially useful when your implicit goal is to expand the power of the bureaucracy, which as a bureaucrat, it always is. Firm handshake nepotism may have been ugly but at least it worked. Now existing credentialism has been flooded with credentials so the solution is to create a new level of meta-credentials, DEI. And I'm certain there will be another level added after that as capitalists are dethroned and the professional-managerial class continues to rise.

I have developed a foolproof method for sussing out whether a game is DEI infested, and it's very simple. Since a DEI game by definition must be boring, gray, bland, and inoffensive, they can't have anything we straight men would consider cool, badass, sexy, or edgy. So I have observed something all these DEI games do: They incorporate "liking food" into a personality trait.

So when trying to figure out "who" made the game, see if you can spot anything overtly food related. A good example: The one character in that nu-Saint's Row with a fucking waffle tattooed and his chest, and I believe there is a whole plot thread where he needs money to buy a waffle maker? (Not exactly sure, I of course didn't play that shit).

So this new game, Concord. It's not even out yet, but they've shown trailers. They've shown beta gameplay footage. They've showed cutscenes. Did we see any "LOL food! Does anyone else like food gaiz??? FOOD!" scenes at all? If the answer is yes, based on that fact alone, you can bet your bottom dollar it is DEI infested, made by xer autismos.

The game was going to fail anyway, most likely, but you'd have to be blind not to realize that the character design bears the DEI stamp of quality. I don't think there's a single person in the whole world who looks at those characters and thinks they're good for selling games.
And yes, characters matter. You want something with charisma and a high standard of quality, especially in high-cost projects.

Now, I know that AIPAC has a disproportionate amount of control over American politicians. They've basically bought and paid for half the Congress.

But what I don't get, is how far does this control really extend? Because you'd think that given the choice between Kamala and Trump, they would obviously spring for Trump because he might actually end the war going on and therefore potentially save Israel from getting squashed like a bug by the surrounding Arab states.

Meanwhile, if Kamala gets in, they would be facing an existential crisis. Like, the same level of incompetence that has led to where we are now, magnified by the fact that Joe Biden with dementia and brain worms is somehow still more intelligent and competent than a pajeet DEI hire.

Am I wrong? If so, could somebody please explain to me like I'm 5 years old how AIPAC could both be in charge of American politics and at the same time not be capable of preventing their own destruction.

Concord's failure has nothing to do with DEI. Concord is semi-competent game in a tired genre. No one is asking for another Overwatch clone when Overwatch is already fatiguing. At the very least, Sony should have drummed up hype with ANY marketing, but they half-assed payed some streamers to play it and then let it die. The game was doomed for mediocre response.

Only half of America votes, only a fifth is politically active.
From this point on Biden is going to be mauled for being unfit for office, they'll call for his resignation before his term ends just to insult him.

Kamila is a DEI hire who's toxic to a lot of Americans, Obama wasn't a DEI hire, but kamila is.

In contrast Trump just survived a bullet passing through his ear, many Americans are going to think they makes allegations Trump is an extremist less credible. That's just how people think. Trump is the man for extreme times and their attempts to imprison him add a lot to his credibility.

Much like France however, the risk isn't Trump willing, it's if the election is fucked up by seperatists. The sort who occupied the capitol hill building and tried to declare Trump as a dictator

Blackrock is the portfolio manager of the Federal Reserve. They are entrusted with investing the FEDbucks as they please, and the FEDbucks are printed non-stop. Blackrock started doing something called ESG investments. ESG investments put certain environmental, social, and governmental considerations before monetary gain (hence the name). Monetary gain is not an issue since infinite FEDbucks. While ESG has plenty of relatively benign and inconspicious, it incorporates DEI and other explicitly globalist, anti-white policies. The heigth of the ESG investments largely coincided with COVID during which thousands of enterprises small and big went bankrupt due to the various restrictions enacted -nominally- to combat the pandemic.

So TL;DR you have the Federal Reserve handing out free money through an intermediary to politically compliant enterprises in a time when every one of them was holding on for dear life. OFC the infinite money printing caused inflation, but everybody is paying for that, so in a sense the FED is also just an intermediary, and ESG investments are a mechanism to transfer wealth to companies that engage in globalist and anti-white social engineering. This also means that "get woke go broke" will never work, since the culprits kept in business not by their profits, but by wealth syphoned from everyone through inflation and given to them in the form of freshly printed ESG bucks.

They’re in full panic mode and are trying to hide their fear by projecting their doom and gloom to Trump supporters (“Haha! Trumpers are totally panicking right now!”). Biden got rekt in the debate so hard that he outright just quit, the dem campaign is currently in disarray and chaos, Kamala’s event in Milwaukee was absolutely lame and DEI-pandery compared to the powerhouse presentation of Vivek and Hulk Hogan in the RNC, and Trump is absolutely dominating in all polls except for the Ipsos one since he survived the assassination attempt, and even then that Ipsos poll was exposed to be heavily rigged to show a (barely) favorable result for Kamala. I think it’s safe to say that a Trump victory is certain, and I think those shills also see the writing on the wall deep inside, hence their mass hysteria.

Your understanding is too simple.

If you want to go the path of transferring the shares to the government, then simply add a stipulation that the shares will be sold back to the market over a certain period of time based on the market cap. Problem solved.

If you want to go the share destruction route, then there’s no problem to solve. Corporations already do this with their own cash. It’s called a share buyback program. Explain to me how enriching people who don’t have 8-figure bank accounts is a bad thing.

If I were the billionaire in question, I’d prefer to sell the shares at market and donate the money to my favorite charities. The wealth cap isn’t an income tax. You can earn and spend unlimited money within the year. You just can’t hold more than the cap into the next year.

I always knew there was some fuckery happening, it seemed as if most of these descisions being made are not fundamentally linked and anti-west, it was only since Kanye got cancelled that I started seeing how it all links back. I was thinking
>ok I see why they hated Andrew Tate, but why Kanye over Jews, who even cares that much about Jews nowadays….then seeing all of the companies, media etc pushing the bulshit are all Jewish owned or funded/dependant. DEI, wokeness, gay mixed race adverts everywhere. Also another thing was that I studied marketing and all of the shit they push objectively won’t help their sales but they still push it, and then seeing the WEF speech where they say
>well these values aren’t natural, they need to be FORCED

If DEI attracted the "best talent" then why aren't they talented?
If it was robust and effective, why wasn't it robust or effective?
If it reflects current society, then I guess current society is shit?
And if you only serve DEI society, are you saying you only serve minorities?

Dumping equities on the open market would lead to all American businesses being foreign-owned. Government retaining them would be de-facto nationalization. Destroying the equities would cause a massive wealth transfer to boomer pension funds that are foisting all the DEI/ESG crap on us.

Kamala is a poo-nigger. I'm being polite when I call her a "DEI hire". The reality is, Kamala is a poo-nigger.

>I promise to hire she-niggers for my VP and SCOTUS picks.
DEI hires
>Woah! What's with the fucking racism?
This is a prime example of what feminists accurately call "imposter syndrome." These sheboons were never qualified for any position of power where they must be intelligent, benevolent, and empathetic. Deep down they know they aren't worthy or competant, so whenever you point out that fact by bringing up the circumstances in which they were hired, they cry "racist!!!" It's all they know. They can't do anything but lean on that crutch. Facing the truth requires too much intellect, so they defensively express their insecurities through a means in which they couldn't control to begin with (their skin color) to make them feel better about their own shortcomings.
>They aint callin us DEI hires because Biden said we wuz, they is callin us DEI hires cuz we black and they is racist white crackas!
So stupid and cringe that they are still at it with this Al Sharpton tactic of victimhood. Imagine being ruled over by these low IQ despotic demons while they repeatedly call you their oppressor.

I've always been too busy or under prepared. These days it also means something much deeper about how society after actual feminism given the dei will function.

Lot of wine aunts to be sure is one thing. I presume I could make time as it is pertinent to the work of societal stability starting around after this election shit stabilizes. Maybe a month.

Then it would be appropriate to full bore into women's issues. Real examples would be better than not. But to me still. It would be more work than anything.

Agreed, having a CA AZ ticket would be political suicide.

The VP must be from the rust belt but:
>can't be jewish
no Shapiro or Pritzker
>can't be a woman
no Whitmer or Klobuchar

When you narrow it down, it looks like Bootyjuice might actually be their best pick, but he's gay and that's a big risk. Too much DEI on the ticket.

picrel is not true from the perspective of my personal timeline, anyone not up to scratch for the position they hold when there are better alternatives denied the opportunity because they are white, is included under the DEI umbrella.

it is also jews and their shills chiefly using `nigger' in the public sphere, the kikes have such a low opinion of black intellect they think they can continue to larp as disaffected white men but I've seen a growing number of black men waking up quickly to the reason their communities were destroyed.

woe unto employers defying subversive jewish dictates but I wouldn't want to be a white man who bent the knee to these parasites in the chaos to come.

it ain't that neither.

the woke left was simply the establishment doing a divide and conquer on the occupy wall street movement
after its success there, it continued as a way to rebrand leftism from being about class warfare, rich vs poor stuff, to being about literally anything else.

#metoo, BLM, DEI, tranny shit, all that stuff is bullshit made-to-order ideologies coming from the top down, all to ensure that the left never goes after rich people or income inequality again.

everything is about race, gender, sexuality, nothing is about labor's shave of the national income, nothing is about house prices, nothing is about wages, nothing is about tax rates being progressive *except* if you're making millions from dividends or capital gains. and don't even fucking think of mentioning that mass immigration suppresses wages and makes housing even less affordable. that's raciss.

while we're at it, climate change bullshit is similar too, but a far older psyop. if climate change was ACTUALLY a priority, we'd see nuclear power plants going up and aggressive tariffs on countries with lax environmental standards, like china and india.
instead, what we get is laws about plastic straws, carbon taxes, car emission standards that are pure protectionism and tax induced inflation.

So the Butler Plan is the best way for the white race to survive in America. For those not in the know it is a plan to move as many whites as possible to the Pacific Northwest and make a homeland for ourselves.
This seems like a great plan but the problem is that property prices are incredibly expensive in the PNW so I have a counter strategy. It will combine the Butler Plan with my on strategy Operation Settler.
A lot of white men are completely fucked over by the current economic system and are just straight up dropping out of society. I don't blame them. DEI job loss, divorce court, diminishing incentive to work due to inflation, etc. I think last I read 8 million men have dropped out of the work force and God only knows how many are searching for jobs they can't get because of the color of their skin. All of these disilussioned white guys are sitting around doing nothing.

Now here is the proposal. Get 5-10 white guys too pool your resources and buy homesteading land or farming property in eastern WA, Western MO, or eastern OR, and create self sufficient settlements. From there maintain and expand.

Obviously these won't be 100% self sufficient but if possible become food water and energy independent. Then try to legally pay as little tax as possible. Use every jewish trick in the book you can think of as long as it's legal.

While your at it by things that will help you maintain self sufficiency: seeds, tools, cnc mills, machine shop equipment, low maintenance vehicles (e.g. toyota hilux), solar panels, greenhouse equipment, 3d printers, ammo presses.

More and more racially aware white people will be waking up. Shit I was a bluepilled neocon cuck four years ago, now I've gone full natsoc. The paradigm is shifting. I hear people on my college campus openly name the jews and become more racist. If jeets are good for anything it's making white women racially aware.

You got hired by someone using whataboutism to discount every qualified person for the position in favor of you. Race, sex, creed. All the things we're not suppose to consider when choosing someone which was all seen as wrong to do in the past is suddenly okay to do now. Its clown world bullshit and they all know it

The worst part is how it probably makes a DEI hire feel deep down. To go through their day knowing they weren't the best person for the job, that they didn't really earn it. That they got the role as a consolation prize

I hope so! lol

I want to become a water management entry level person, it's a test and get a license... if I am permited to take it.

I have an extremely poor education, like bearly 9.5-11 years alltogether, depends if skipping is counted! If by some miracle idiots let me get anywhere near that test and license I plan on using all the DEI to get a municipal job somewhere and do shit all basics only!
I hope the idiots will hire me.

turns out it was DEI all along.
you can believe that the gov't conspired (or anyone) to have Trump assassinated.
they failed because of their own DEI policies.
if they had only hired the best people for the inside job instead of jew and pubic hair on head and female then they would have succeeded.
ok, now, remove any and all conspiracy from the equation. the SS failed to protect because of DEI policies of hiring people based on pubic hair on head and vagina having instead of merit.
so there you go, DEI is at fault either way.

Kamala being associated with DEI is the only possible explanation of her rise in politics, with no private or public sector success.

I do believe the same conditions that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union are starting to form in the US, just manifesting in US ways.

We have a much stronger and more stable oligarchy though, so infighting isn't likely to take it down the way the Soviet Union came down.

But DEI type policies have created a crisis of competency which is eating away our social underpinnings like termites. We won't realize it until it's truly too late though.

Boomers have decided to hoover up every bit of wealth they can, leverage it 100x, and die at the top of a gilded mountain after pulling up all the ladders.

Nobody trusts the government (and rightly so) because the government has been mismanaged into a playground for capital and actual literal psychopath ideologues.

The generation in the middle of their productive peak (Millennials) are still struggling and thus the largest source of manpower and motivation is giving up

The generations coming behind them are going to have it *even worse* and are going to implode as bad if not far worse. Gen Z is functionally retarded vs previous generations, and Boomers have fucking brain damage from lead so that says something.

Our biggest companies are treating the economy like a slush fund and labor as slaves, which is creating a dozen different crises at every level of daily society.

Faith in America is gone. There's no hope for housing. No hope for jobs. No hope for a future. We're all just holding on until next week. Then next week- Just gotta make it through the week.

It's even worse than the End of History. It's the Long Misery. The Nothing.

The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of this tumid river
Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men

What happened to the western animation industry? There are animations made in the early-mid 1900s that look better than all the soulless plastic 3d slop being made today. I'm confident if someone put some actual effort into making a good animation and didn't inject a bunch of DEI retardation, it would be a massive success

>Things have been slipping for a good while
There's a ridiculous permissiveness out there in the professional world. You've got thick boomers in charge, by the sole virtue of the people who used to be in charge being too old now and so it was the turn of the greedier boomers who wanted power as opposed to the hippie/slacker boomers that never took anything too seriously but will have a far more comfortable retirement than millennials or zoomers who worked twice as hard as them.
The problem is all these boomers want to be considered the good guy. So the permissiveness never ends. The way they bend over backwards to accommodate BAMEs that can barely speak English but know how to play the victim card!
These are the people who are prepared to pay real money to "DEI" jobs. And it's not just DEI jobs, nor is it just taxpayers' money. There's all manner of absolutely irrelevant email jobs given to idiots (always women or BAMEs). Even in the fucking private sector where we're supposed to actually be making money. And then when the normies see the obvious favouritism, they think "well SHE does NOTHING so I'm an idiot if I give a fuck about my job"... and yet that same lazy normie will have the union in and at your throat if they feel someone said something mean about their work ethic.
I'm not saying Day of the Pillow, but I am saying we need to pack ALL of these boomers off to their comfy holiday homes full time as soon as possible while there's anything left to salvage.
And yes, even the people who set out to poison everyone else are themselves being poisoned by it. Tards like Kuenssberg and Marianna have managed to maneuver themselves in to a position where some thick boomer who should be finding a smarter hatchetman doesn't want this girl to be upset with him. They fall so far short of the likes of William F Buckley, who did a great job of impersonating a reactionary despite being a commie that it's just depressing. But they get the job anyway!

All the job openings advertised are either for things they wouldn't let you get started towards or just positions that they want someone with more experience to take a pay cut for.

Aside from that they literally just don't pay a living wage.

Aside from that dei is commendable for a bit, but most of those women are going to quit and the men will just have no clue wtf to do with themselves.

Makes the military industrial complexes mouth water but that's a huge waste of an indebted countries remaining gas.

Part of preventing this is as another anon said to differentiate Judaism and the Jewish people.

How did one simple strategy obliterate Trump’s chances of winning after everything that happened? Trump spent his entire campaign so far focusing on Biden’s ability to do the job. Now Trump has to worry about someone decades younger than himself whom is also a prosecutor. So far the attack from Trump has been that Kamala is DEI and not her awful policies or history as California prosecutor. If Trump continues to attack a black queen the brothas will leave Trump for Kamala instead, you never attack a black queen. If Kamala gets in office the lawfare will reach another level and Trump will end up in prison for life.

It’s all or nothing for Trump. If he loses expect mass suicide.

Amazon expects a minimum of 9 hours a day and 6 days a week from its engineers, despite the fact that it is proven to murder creative productivity. They also want to built factory towns that are 15 minute cities de facto controlled by Amazon the same way Disney politically controlled Disney World, but with distopian 1984 alexa surveillance. In short they are building neo-fuedalism with every dollar you spend with them.

Their underlings @ CNN et al are reeing because they are deranged and unaware of their complicity in Don's reelection. The tech Jews are now openly aligning with Don and others are backstabbing the Dems by supporting this dumb bitch knowing she can't win, while also earning the social credit of supporting the DEI candidate.

yes, but i have further differentiation than most people. I was also a submarine combat vet. The submarine was an environment where everyone was scared af of the entire boat right. In that environment the personality type you are describing is INSANELY valuable and respected. OCD means that guy cares about us not dying to this deathtrap of a submarine we all have to go down in. Also there was no women. The critical nature of how i normally speak to people didn't land just like it always doesn't land but the environment was so machismo that it didn't matter. I could be openly rude to people if they didn't know their shit and dude wouldn't hold a grudge a week later he would just accept it as common culture. This was the only period in my life that was like this. Everything with civilians has been nails on chalk board and the DEI wokeness just made everything 10x worse.

The thing I'm trying to tell you is you only have to make the imaginary distraction last for 2 weeks to a month, depending on how weak a personality you are or aren't, if you can kick the chemical dependency part then the imagination/eye of the beholder part is cake. I can re-write that imagation part at will I just need to make sure there aren't negative stress factors coming into my life (other humans always).

The really big thing that freed me was a complete overwhelmingly self despair in my late 30s and i smoked a lot of weed and did some mushrooms and had revelations on the earyl life shit and came to terms with who i am. Once those chains were off everything became so much easier.... but the truth is... i don't operate on a morality like normal people anymore. My morality is more ancient now.

You underestimate how powerful the imagination part can be and I don't really know your distinctions between limbic and other I am not that medically inclined.

Why tho? It was an obvious fatal blow to Biden, but it probably created enough time for them to swap candidates.

Let's be real though, The Demoniac Obamacrats were always planning on Joe dying in office at some point. Kamala was always a possible option for them. Now they have to stick with their DEI hire after the Chief Dotard dies of a coof aneurysm.

Depends on the store, i live in what you would call a rural place in a small home'ly state.
We only had 1 DG up till about 5 years ago then they blew up. Our "city" is pretty big about 25,000 people, our county is pretty spread out and we have about 45,000 people in the entire county including the city. There are a few smaller "towns" in the county but none of them have more than about 1000 people. The county is mostly spread out with houses scattered.
They had 1 on the main road in town, built around 2002'ish i believe. It was the only one up to about 5-8 years ago maybe then they built one dead in the middle of town in the high traffic area with super high real-estate. Then in 2019-2020 others started popping up. Now we have 7 spread out across the central part of the county with the one out my way being the farthest from town.
The thing is, going into the other ones in town its an absolute train wreck. The one in the center of town is absolutely useless, nothing but DEI nigger hires, they dont stock the shelves they leave the stocking carts at the end of the isles and you basically get what you want off the stocking carts because the niggers wont put it on the shelves. Floors havent been mopped in years now, its filthy. Pretty much the same thing with 4 others. The very first one built stays "kinda" clean, its gotta bunch of old black ladies that work in it and they kinda care about it and keep it up. The one out my way is the only one that employs white people and they do care about it, sweep the floor every night, mop once a week, and actually spend all day stocking stuff on the shelves. Its how a store is supposed to be but we have a white manager, and she hires white girls to work the store. Totally different from one store to the next, in the same county, depending on who the manager is and whether or not they care

so the hunt was on for a black woman. and they landed on kamala bc it was easy since shed already been vetted while running for president and already had name recognition.

SK & China will eventually go the way of Japan. Honestly that's basically what SK is now, they're a Japan-lite from the 90s & 2000s. In that they have a lot of soft power through pop culture but not much else. China is built up as a threat, but everything about China fucking sucks or is a mirage at best. China has a shit military, a shit propped up economy (80s Japan was an actual threat because their superiority in 80s era tech was unplanned while china's is designed to fail since it's their sweatshops that's propping them up.)

Now Poos, they're actually using their population to just flood every nation on earth through sheer hordes of poos which causes those nations to conform with Indian culture & value which results in DEI, the troon shit (they have troon gods) & SJWism because it's often Indian leadership who push for all that crap. They're using the Chinese strategy of just turning everything chinese through population numbers except with Poos, it seems to be internationally sanctioned since the West is exporting them everywhere and even to Japan.

South Korea is a very minor problem in comparison because they're basically just New-rich Slanted eye White people who idealize Blacks. The USA already has a huge sect of Whites who do the same exact shit.

I think he is a well spoken streamer and often appears to have good insight, but in reality he just puts the wrapping and bow on group think points developed here and else where. A talent and skill in its own, but his base insights are never his own.

With his recent perspectives on the only WHITE man being picked for VP, and now whining about competent people filling positions, that the right has been mocking for DEI incompetent hires, its clear fuentes is just following the same path as Spencer.

Joggers do not have the intellectual capacity to calculate risk vs reward, that combined with zero impulse control means shoplifting and getting arrested. Villainmaxxing is about low risk high reward schemes that work for at least a decent percent of the people who try them, and yield great reward, like for example a high paying white collar job meant for a DEI candidate, where the only possible risk is HR thinking you might not be the race you said you are.

She is going to lose in the most historic landslide this country has ever seen. Every Democrat will turn against her and blame her for everything. It's hilarious, she is their scape goat of failure. It's literally all she's good as is to take a huge LOSS, she is the worst fucking dumbass candidate they could have.

Yes. JD Vance is clearly a finance class puppet, it's rarely this clear and unambiguous. He says some basic "conservative" bullshit like "I had diet mountain dew... I guess that's racist now" and it's impressive enough that he's somehow permissible. He represents private equity interests because dems and the left are more and more going after the specific "free market capitalism" they need to continue to profit. They're hoping you think it's all about ESG and DEI and being anti-white so they can continue to profit.

The latest example, their DEI policies and the effects on the secret service have been out in the open for months, no resignation until the republican candidate almost gets their head blown off on live TV. Same as Joe Biden being senile for a half decade, they act like it is all new information. Why? Is it to prevent drones from realizing they're hideous demonic liars fighting for niggers and their overlords? What is their endgame?

What is villainmaxxing? It’s simply white men getting ahead in life using deception and breaking rules instead of supplicating to the Jews in power. I’m NOT encouraging breaking laws, but sidestepping the social contract, aka rules that Jews rigged against us, and doing this makes Jews and normies seethe endlessly. Examples of villainmaxxing are listed below.

Why “villain”? Mainstream society already treats white men as if we are evil just for existing, and western women specifically seem to get off on exploiting “good men” so why not break these gay rules and embrace being a villain, a boogeyman status they’ll give us anyways?

Know about another scheme white men use that is against the current order’s rules and makes Jews and normies seethe? Lets hear it, that’s what villainmaxxing is about. All things listed are things that send the Jew media and normies into a seething frenzy.

Forget black pilling, NPNW, and all of these other unproductive internet subcultures, we are building a new subculture rooted in defiant action, something that Jews and normies will lament us for. Stop being a “good man” and be a villain

Why don’t politicians get this? How much people have to spend is 95%+ of their political concern. Most people don’t care about foreign wars or abortion or dei or who said what mean things. They only care about those things when it affects the price of stuff they buy.
We didn’t have ads joking about how fast food got too expensive, nor it wasn’t the center of every conversation when Trump was president. That’s now.

It is and it's also realizing that Japan isn't like the US and Western Europe. The Japanese have a proud history and they're not willing to back down on bullshit pseudo-history that wokeness is doing.

So this is a win-win for Japan. It paints Ubisoft as culturally misappropriating Japanese history and DEI is realizing that Japanese are wiling to push back. Though now the globalists are probably going to even double down even harder on them.

In fact, Japanese were sold and trafficked as slaves in the 16th century by the Portuguese. A fact that Hideyoshi, the Taiko (dictator) called them out on and was one of the prime reasons why his successor Ieyasu (Toranaga's historical basis for you Shogun fans) wanted to expel the Portuguese.

Japan has its history of atrocities pre-20th century like attacking Chinese and Koreans during their wako raids (there were even Koreans sold as slaves to the Europeans during the Imjin War period), but they didn't have anything to do with the African slave trade which Europeans on the Atlantic side and Muslims and Indians did on the Indian Ocean and Saharan side of things. But obviously these woketards haven't picked up a book or researched properly.

Because she was picked as a DEI vice president and the actual president got too old. It's the same reason that Henry Wallace was kicked out as FDR's VP, he was unsuitable. The establishment Dems just didn't have enough time this time, so they settled on Harris but they still expect to lose.

>So how does society recover?
A massive jobs&education program from the top down. I think it should be the space program. Invest everything we've got into science related to the space program, ranging from math, physics and engineering, all the way to stuff like psychology (what happens when people live in isolation for extended periods of time?) and political sciences (how do you effectively govern a colony on mars?)
get everyone working on this program, get high schools involved with projects, get college students involved through internships, etc, etc. also allow an option through the space force for people that didn't get their diploma.
all of this would require getting rid of DEI and woke shit and securing the country first, of course. but afterwards you'd get people educated and trained in actually useful fields with work experience, which would revitalize the economy

Expect more tech nightmares, Boeing planes, Hyperinflation etc etc because our best and brightest would unironically rather live in a goon cave playing video games and/or watching the world burn out of sheer spite.

Nonsense. Trump and Larry Fink speak to each other daily. Several articles have been written about it. It’s the reason the RNC turned into a diversity fest. Larry Fink basically invented corporate DEI. He wanted the RNC more inclusive to faggots, niggers, and jeets. So thats what we got.

If she is declared the candidate, she will pick a woman. Female bosses don’t like hiring men, because they fear others will defer to him. She will select a non-white woman. In fact she will pick the ugliest blackest woman she can find, because she wants to be prettiest. Somebody who will not outshine her in any way, but help her double-down on the DEI bully currency. She will pick Stacey Abrams. You can screenshot this.

They let those things happen so that more goyim can die. They also don't want to protect Trump because, even though he's a good goy, he's hard to control. Same reason why Biden mysteriously died of covid.

absolutely delusional. This country is now completely dependent on international trade to feed its population and to provide its manufacturing. At no point in time is it capable of waging total war against a forign power that actually fights back nor can it sustain itself in any kind of prolonged civil war. California alone, with supposedly 'one of the world's highest GDPs' can't even keep its forests from being set on fire each summer, and then BURNING for the ENTIRE summer due to a lack of resources. Imagine the absolute nightmare that 'forest fire season' would be during a civil war, randos taking pot shots at fire patrol vehicles, dissidents blowing up bridges and other vital infustructure that can not be rebuilt in a conflict zone, and so on. Half the state's dams need to be repaired and 80% of the roads are constantly due for some form of maintence. Nearly every bridge and tunnel in the usa was built in the 1910-1930s with an estimated 100 year lifespan, all of which are about to hit their expiration date and..... look at that, we gave all our steel mills to china. We shut down all our coal production and have no real domestic fabrication for large scale public works projects. But yeah sure, wage those world/civil wars, you retard.

Women taking over positions of power is just an extension of wokeness. Trump will win, most assuredly, but even the RNC is woke now, and the racists will be pacified with Trump as President. They will still push BBC spam just like they did when Trump was President with BLACKED. They've done it before and they will do it again to spawn a new generation of BBC-loving degenerates.

Trump is now at this point just a pawn in the game, he's not going to do anything to the political system but give people renewed confidence in the economic market. It will change nothing about DEI and wokeness.

White people fell hook, line and sinker for the meritocracy meme. No other culture on the planet practices it save for those from Europe or descended from Europeans. It's why we're getting a bunch of Indians in tech companies now and why Jews have historically done very well. If you're considered one of them it opens many doors. It's nepotism all the way down. I can't even get mad, because they're looking out for one another, and the only reason Whites are losing due to DEI and affirmative action is because we haven't played that game since the French Revolution.

Companies do this shit because of stock holders. It's just a game. They hire the DEI shitters and useless zooms so that they don't get the libs on their backs, and then that gives them a reason to fire them a year later to show how lean they are to their investors.

this is a bait and switch. they're replacing it with some sorta 'bridge initiative' from what i understand, which is at least equally as bad as DEI. they're basically hoping a silent rebrand will let them get away with it.

That's unironically why you are not hiring. High ladder men hate other men, they hire on DEI because is free money and hire immigrants because are cheaper and accept abuse. The man is the wolf of the man

Nothing special. Big businesses like Boeing start to go for DEI, they can afford to because they already cornered a big segment of the market, no innovation needed, just to keep the company on life support while pumping stocks so the investors can cash out quickly. Lower wages = more profit = better performing stocks

Cope. They have unlimited money from low interest rate loans just for checking DEI stuff. Being unable to get loans or bring costly prohibited means bankruptcy because your concurrent can aggressively lower the prices and invest more on research, cyclical crisis made by jews and government harassment sueing you to hell. Just look Germany gun companies post war trying to compete against unlimited money, paperclip technology stolen and traitors, the smallest mistake or unlucky means bankruptcy. In today day and age banks control everything

Evil kikes & evil friends blew up the towers, so shooting one dude dead and injuring two on the stands behind the podium for the sake of authenticity should not be that hard for evil kikes.
Thomas and Matthew are names of the apostles of Jesus, and they are not Crooks.

She’ll never be more popular than she is right now. It’s literally only down from here.

Right now, she’s the greatest candidate of all time. The greatest VP of all time. The best resume of all time. She’s the right color. And omg, have you heard, she’s a woman. She’s perfect! And especially compared to Trump! Oh man!

…that’s the narrative right now. She’s the shiny new toy.

But soon, she’ll open her mouth. She’ll give a speech. She’ll do something dumb. Somebody will leak a thing about some stuff.

And then the shine will dull, and people will remember why no one supported her campaign in 2020, why no one in her own party likes her, and why she’s been relegated to the sidelines these last 3 years as the DEI VP.

She is peaking right now (and in the days ahead). But shit man, it’s only July 22. And given the speed at which this political cycle is moving, that’s wayyyy too early to peak.

By September, I’d expect polls to normalize with Trump up by a comfortable 3-5 pts in the swing states.

Literally the only thing Trump can do to screw this up is agree to debate her.
