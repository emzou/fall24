Trump will be brought in to be the face of putting away the woke and dei in an attempt to get right wingers to buy back in to the country. So he'll have a lot of symbolic victories and accomplishments that won't really amount to much in reality.

NEET engineer that studied fabrication specifically the automation and machinery ultimately leading to my own semiconductor manufacturing facility, welding shop, and machine shop here

I will not work because of the 70% tax bracket id wind up in just to fund this communist dystopia. I stay at home, wake up whenever I fucking want, and physically have everything besides the "chip" facility. I could have easily built it, there's a few trade secrets and stuff I didn't have, but I'm sitting on designs for the main tools. I'm just not going to do work though. I'm not doing a fucking thing after the cops violated my rights

KILL COPS
KILL COPS
KILL COPS
KILL COPS
BLOW THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES UP
CUT THEIR KIDS FACE OFF, WEAR IT LIKE A MASK, AND TORTURE COPS TO DEATH OVER THE COURSE OF WEEKS

Also because DEI but my plan was to only hire whites and ignore all agencies that tried to force me to hire niggers.
Now, now I am the nigger.

If the orders are to shoot White men in the back I expect they'll enjoy those orders quite thoroughly and carry them out with gusto and with no perceptible hesitation.

>Enjoy getting raped by niggers lol
Cope. Coastal bug men and liberals will be fed into the grinder. No exceptions. Conservatives unlucky enough to be behind the lines in blue states will be pressed into the express cattle cars to suicide duty on the front.

>they realize this, right?
No. They fundamentally do not understand the problem, all they realize is that there is a problem. All of the foundations of modern society are there to make the average person into a slave (which isn't surprising when you realize how Jews view everyone who isn't Jewish). The people running this circus don't really care about the fact they've created a world that inherently lacks purpose because A. they hate you and want you to die. and B. removing purpose was part of the intention in order to brainwash humanity into becoming domestic cattle. The elites won't ever give you a wife or a home because you're asking the most greedy, nepotistic, and psychopathic individuals on the entire planet to somehow miraculously become charitable, empathetic, and repentant: they wouldn't even be doing the things they do if they were remotely capable of developing such traits.

Now that DEI is coming to an end with states outright banning it and the Biden admin's attempt to resurrect the Obongo era going up in smoke, what happens next? There are generations of White men who have been under/unemployed since Obama took office and will need significant incentives to even consider working an entry level job as an airplane maintainece worker and whatnot. As a NEET since 2015, I can't even fathom what would get me into the workforce since I've grown accustomed to an aristocratic style of living, eating healthy foods, getting as much sleep as I need, and most importantly never restricting my speech or aspects of my personality that would irk normoids since I only communicate with people on the internet, why would I even bother laboring? And no, negative reinforcement does not work since I've mentally prepared for the fact that I'd have to die at any moment my lifestyle would be endangered since homelessness and wagecucking are not viable alternatives and I do not see the value in life unless its enjoyable.

>Interesting perspectives.
When normal people are being shit on for who they are even though they did nothing wrong, and the media and pop culture heroes are criminal douchebags and degenerates, the public stop caring and want to be left alone.

Here's an interesting one. This subversion did not escape its creators. Even NGO, corporate, and government entities are having massive issues with espionage and leakage because of this. They cannot retain any institutional knowledge or keep anything secret anymore. People have no loyalty or pride in organizations that are not loyal to them or protect their in-group, especially if they're selected over incompetent and downright criminal niggers and degenerates. It's the equivalent of setting off a nuclear morale bomb every time it has to be mentioned in a brief, meeting, or celebration. They didn't deserve it, they can't run anything, and now everything is crashing with no survivors.

Recently there was a gigantic purge of security clearances in the US government space. It is the golden age of espionage when your own guys aren't loyal anymore. These purges got really bad during the Biden administration. The guys who hand out clearances select for people who like America (and aren't in debt), and the people who like America think that he is probably illegitimate and the directly works against their interests and the interests of the United States (not to mention the de facto halving of their income due to hyperinflation), so mutiny is absolutely rampant in the 2020 decade when security leakage was practically unheard of prior to Snowden. There's a lot of people going to jail for leaking stuff for pocket change, mostly to China.

People noticing this shit and calling it out is how you begin undermining their efforts and countering their influence. Look at what happened to Blackrock. It literally started with one post on /pol/ explaining what it was (pic related), more and more people reposted it, more and more people talked about it, and now its common knowledge OTI that there's this massive hedge fund using it's literally infinite money to push leftist propaganda in movies and video games. Now ESG investing is becoming a dirty word, investors are pulling their money, and the man behind it all, Larry Fink, is basically now a shorthand for rainbow capitalism and media control in the same way "Quisling" is shorthand for a traitor. Now it's happening to Sweet Baby Inc and all those other DEI commissar consulting firms.

The absolute best thing you can do is call this stuff out, keep noticing it, and keep encouraging others to do the same. Their methods rely on being able to act behind the scenes and avoid responsibility for their actions, and by putting them in the spotlight, you're both making them a target and inhibiting their ability to push their propaganda.

They know this. It's why every single DEI thread has shills running damage control around the clock running damage control and trying to inorganically convince anons that it's nothing and they should stop noticing things and stop calling them out, because they know their downfall starts with people noticing things.

Troll post but anyone lurking who thinks this way should ask themselves this:
"How can the problem with Gen Z men be that they aren't adjusting to reality, if Gen Z has always lived in a period of immense DEI programs?"
There are four logically valid answers to this statement
>1. Men are born with an inbuilt sense that they are or should be superior, regardless of their environment or upbringing
In which case, you should ask yourself why it's reasonable to believe that all men are born believing their are superior to women, but it's reasonable to believe all women could be born with similar emotional predispositions that affect how they make decisions.
>2. Gen Z men didn't really live in a period of immense DEI
In which case, you should be able to name the specific time or transition period between pre- and post-DEI, and why before was not DEI-based and after was DEI-based
>3. The problem with Gen Z men is that they are not adjusting to reality, but that new reality has nothing to do with equality
In which case, you should try to understand specifically what that new reality is and what events led to it coming about
>4. The problem with Gen Z men is something else
In which case, you should try to understand what that something else is, and what caused it.

Yeah, and the worst thing about them is how they jump on the "we're minorities" bandwagon because they're non-white. Even though they come from the most overpopulated country in the world. America and its anti-white, DEI religion can go fuck itself.

oh, that's how you counter misinformation. you prevaricate. huh. i would have thought that you made a good-faith assumption about your opponent's beliefs as you understand them and work from there to break through cognitive biases with undeniable facts, but I suppose it is a lot easier to go "um you're using the wrong word, sweetie, we're not a DIE firm, we're a consultancy firm"
a consultancy firm which benefits exclusively from DIE initiatives.
here you break in with "how would SBI remain profitable if DIE initiatives went away?" Frankly it seems like most of their revenue is a result of shakedowns based on the longer quote from belair that anon found, but it would be interesting to see how this guy tries to explain it.

>Anyway, despite this massive moral panic around it that doesn't really make much sense,
>that doesn't make much sense to me so it just doesn't make sense
cognitive bias, "im the smartest man alive mortyyyyy buuuuurrrrppp"

>DEI does have problems. A lot of the practices it employs -- various forms of implicit bias training -- don't work for a lot of people. They can reinforce biases, unfortunately.
so not only does it not work, it does the opposite of what it's supposed to do. is this one of those incorrect facts he was talking about earlier? this feels like an incorrect fact. definitely an instance of "pattern recognition bad". and lots of cognitive dissonance too. "It does the exact opposite of what we intend it to do, why are people freaking out about it?"
that hurts to write.

>But you have all this funding going into these things.
why?

>Because also, in the modern internet landscape, people are not incentivized to receive new information and say "Oh, I was wrong. I should reconsider and go educate myself."
this is actually true, but only as a result of the fact of cognitive biases. grugbrain don't want to waste time learning new facts and things when old way work good. especially when new information challenges entrenched beliefs. the "modern internet" bit is fluff, the same was true from the dawn of time.
>They're incentivized to say "What I believed before is definitely true. I'm gonna dig my heels in. This is part of a larger crusade against me, and I've got to fight back."
here is where you ask them "isn't that basically what transgender people do?" and watch their heads explode.
this is pure and total projection. they do not want to see it in themselves, so they project it onto everyone else around them. "YOU are the one clinging bitterly to a false belief in spite of all the evidence to the contrary! YOU ARE!"

"EXPLAIN!"
kek

>And there are all these other people saying "Yeah, you should fight back!" It's a real can of worms.
yeah, stitched up fleshworms hanging off a pooner's abdomen. ask how that's substantially different than how the trans community treats anyone who suggests that they might not be correct.

The left and right are both owned by corporate (jewish) interests at this point. Everything that goes on in Washington is political theater and nothing will get done because keeping the status quo is the most profitable action they can take. We live in a country where a cure for cancer would be suppressed because curing cancer would be less profitable than treating cancer.

It doesn't matter if the country is burning to the ground thanks to BLM/Antifa protests, if inflation is so rampant that money is worth more as paper than it is as currency, or that investment firms such as Blackrock are buying all the vacant homes they can so they can raise housing prices and rents, as long as the corporate elite can keep making their record-breaking profits then they don't care about the consequences of their actions. These giant investment firms are also the ones who have been pushing the recent DEI invitiates and are reason why censorship is so rampant - you're correct that it has to do with money in that regard.

If /pol/ makes you too upset you're always welcome to go to >>>/lgbt/ to find similarly-minded individuals.

Nathan: Yeah, it's worth billions of dollars! And that's the issue: Things like DEI -- which by the way, Sweet Baby isn't a DEI firm. DEI tends to center around hiring and personnel and other forms of equity and inclusion within the workplace, whereas Sweet Baby consults on projects and helps them tackle diverse subject matter, but they don't advise on hiring and things of that nature.

Anyway, despite this massive moral panic around it that doesn't really make much sense, DEI does have problems. A lot of the practices it employs -- various forms of implicit bias training -- don't work for a lot of people. They can reinforce biases, unfortunately. But you have all this funding going into these things. What is the point if they're not really working? So the goal of helping people create workplaces and spaces that are more equitable is good, but the ways these companies are going about it is not great -- and is pretty much always in service of capital, because they've realized that diverse workplaces are more profitable. So the incentive structure is also not good. It's a giant mess, but the reason people are so up in arms about it is not the reason it actually needs to be more critically examined.

Chris: Yeah, there's not nothing there, but it's not what they think is there. It's also like, conspiracies and conspiracy YouTube really always give me a headache. It's just like, go outside a little bit. But like you said, there's a there there. It's just not the there that you think it is.

Lord I'll just spoonfeed the whole thing if you're going to be so weird about it

Riley: This kind of thing is always hard to write about. You have all these threads, and as we've learned from our colleagues who cover misinformation, how do you talk about misinformation without spreading it?

Nathan: When I do a piece like this, there are a few things I think about, but one thing that's been stuck in my head ever since I learned it is: When it comes to misinformation -- when it comes to facts that are just straight up incorrect -- the problem with the way the human brain receives information is that repetition solidifies something in our minds. That can be true even when you've heard something incorrect, a rumor, or a falsehood several times, and one of those times was a debunking. The problem is, we slowly but surely forget the context in which we received information, and a year or two later, your brain might even process that debunking as reinforcing that misinformation -- as "Oh yeah, I heard that somewhere." That kind of a thing.

So it's really hard. It's still good to debunk stuff, but debunking in broad strokes does not work. Because also, in the modern internet landscape, people are not incentivized to receive new information and say "Oh, I was wrong. I should reconsider and go educate myself." They're incentivized to say "What I believed before is definitely true. I'm gonna dig my heels in. This is part of a larger crusade against me, and I've got to fight back." And there are all these other people saying "Yeah, you should fight back!" It's a real can of worms.

"whites" as the jews like us to say, do make some compelling arguments for their hate. there does seem to be evidence of a concerted effort to disenfranchise, disempower and replace whites in particular. foundational european, western-world societies. what exactly is globohomo doing to you, except giving you a ticket out of your owh shithole? giving you DEI benefits left and right, giving you incentives and subsidies to run from your origins into the places what "whites" established as prosperous without your help

They do

DEI hiring is high in the oilfield and they promote the ladies to sales or HR (they’re almost always a mistress to a higher up) and the tokens get token positions

Spics are the majority of the hands outside the Bakken or DJ

They’re lousy as well but cheaper and too busy whining about their race, being gay, or trying to inspire little girls by being a massive whore to a rich oilman and pretending to work.

I think writing and knowing what "good" code is is very much a trade skill that only comes from experience working on large projects. Most software engineering isn't trying to hyper-optimize some algorithm or try some novel technique like academic coding usually is. It's concerned with breaking down a system into parts that can be easily understood and modified by other humans. It's primarily a UX problem, not a math problem, but still requires good math talent to understand the nature of systems, which most DEI hires (and frankly most people in this profession) don't have.

The problem there is that your narrative was always fucking retarded. DEI departments are do-nothing PR smokescreens. Diversity consultants have no real control over anything, they just point out when something in the research is mistaken.
All of this is another attempt at hooking dumb disaffected young boys into the nu right wing by pretending the problem with (thing isolated boys like) is women and gays and black people.
It's an old play at this point.

>when you go to a job interview and they see your white skin color, you're already at a -10 points.
I have some friends who work for the government and the stories they tell of hiring and working with DEI quotas are hellish.
They say they have to make it a point to always record the interviews they have with African-Americans, cause without a doubt if they have a few come in to interview for a position, at least one of them will reach out to HR and complain.
Whether it be racism, or sexism, or ableism, he says there will ALWAYS be one trying to get their foot in the door by threatening to sue. They make it a point to record it so they can just hand it to HR and tell them to fuck off, they're hiring one of the other people.
Worst is how they have truly incompetent niggers, but firing them is such a pain, it's easier to just promote them out of the office and let some other place deal with them.
Whenever they mention the competency crisis, just remember govies promote niggers to higher positions just so they don't have to deal with their retardation.

I don't fly anywhere anymore with a Boeing plane, and I always double check the pilots are white. I mainly fly SAS and KLM for that reason, I will also fly with Korea Air and Emirates since the former is high functioning aryan adjacent and the latter is usually hiring white pilots or high caste arabs. They haven't falled to DEI yet but SAS and KLM are on track though.

This. Everyone in this thread needs to go pick up a book on learning rhetoric. It will literally save your life and allow you to beat the jew at its own game as it tries to disenfranchise and discriminate against you (e.g. Larry "Rat" Fink and his discriminatory DEI bullshit).

They're not as smart as they think they are. Pay attention to their tactics and then turn around and use them right back on them. Their tactics do not change.

And this is what puzzles me to no extent. I have been closely studying their propaganda since Nigger Jesus and his cult of personality in 2008.

It baffles me why they haven't changed or updated their tactics.

Or perhaps this is it? There's really nothing more the anti-American globohomo adherents in power can do outside of taking off the already-slipping mask and going full fucking dictatorship on this country.

Also, you are not "White" due to the ongoing "Cold War" against white people and the white genocide and ethnocide occurring in this country.

Instead, you are "slavic".

Pick a country....such as Czech Republic and if the interviewer asks you, tell them that your family come to American to escape the big bad evil natzis.

This way, you use all the right buzzwords they want to hear. Also, don't say "my wife" or "my girlfriend", instead say "my partner" so it's ambiguous.

If you haven't noticed, there is a Cold War being waged on white men by the anti-American globohomo uni-party cabal that rules over Washington D.C. And anti-American kikes like Larry Fink who push the "DEI" racist bullshit are waging war on white people as well.

Therefore, you need to learn how to lie and beat them at their own racist and discriminatory game.

Their bigoted and backwards racism has gotten the corporate free ride for 10-15 years
That's not a 'conspiracy theory'
It's a well-grounded in reality fact

Standing up to what? Reality? Good luck

The silence is deafening because guess what faggots
No one wants your woke games
Everyone knows that down deep
They know they haven't been giving gamers what they want
Corporate DEI policies have been funded with 0% wall street funny money
That's over

Now somewhere down deep they have to reconcile with the fact that if after all this time no one STILL wants their games, they are going to go under
The mechanism to infect games is under the spotlight
Because it's not just woke employees, it's woke consultants on top of woke employees doing the damage.

These corporations are paying people to make their games even more unplayable.
Paying people to lose more money.

Oh noes, someones found it out and is giving power to gamers to see who these consultants are infecting, thus can vote with their wallet EVEN more.

They know they are in trouble, that their grift is causing game companies to go under, and are SCARED that this will amp it up even more.
These people want blanket authority to subtly propagandize you in their games, if not outright blast you.

The sad thing is they actually think they 'won' gamergate. They didn't. Their hypocrisy, degeneracy, and movement was shown to indeed exist.

They can't handle that people are pointing out their propaganda, which strickens the game with the Gay Scarlett Letter, a big G.
You're not supposed to know
You're just supposed to ingest, accept, and conform

Their racism is supposed to be virtuous.
Their degeneracy is supposed to be the standard.
You and the companies are supposed to fund all of them.
But you hate it and the corporations can't afford it.
This tool will steer you to comfy games and warn you of the propaganda.

D = diversity. We must have lots of shitskins, roasties, and faggots.
E= equity. This is extremely radical Marxist idea. Equality was bad enough (breaking our right of association), but equality just means equal opportunities for all. Equity means equal OUTCOMES for all. If outcomes of men vs women, or whites vs spics vs niggers aren't identical then in their deranged minds it is because of systemic -isms. It's the polar opposite of meritocracy.
I = inclusiveness. What it really means is you must be Fake Nice to everyone at all times or people get butthurt and cry. It also means you must accept the DEI load of shit with a happy smile.

If you wonder why it feels like everything is simultaneously getting shittier, it is due to DEI. The functional reality of it is to punish white men for the crime of being white men.

I was just in an internal q/a with the CEO. (Streamed to all employees and contractors you niggers, I’m not claiming to be a big shot). The man is buying out suppliers, (such as Spirit), and doing everything OTHER than dealing with the DEI crap to try to get things in line. He knows what the problem is though. He had to bite back a scowl when thanking his diversity compliance handler for her work, and wouldn’t reiterate the company’s commitment to DEI himself. He gave that job to some other woman who had to explain that despite the drop in quality, Boeing is still committed to DEI hiring. I think if you asked the CEO behind closed doors what he thought of DEI, he would say things that make /pol/ blush, but his hands are tied. Fink has his semitic nails in deep. China is going to win the war in aerospace manufacturing because Boeing is being forced into suicide.
Not sure why kikes are forcing the west into ruin when China is still out there as a powerful, competent world power. You would think keeping their golem strong would be important to them.

basically, Jews who pull the strings have been pushing big businesses to hire blacks, coloreds, and handicaps rather than whites. Its been pushed HARD the last 3 years and the Kikes in Kontrol have been giving brownie points and favors to business who push DEI in their hiring strategy. This forced acceptance of those people of color over more qualified whites has lead to a massive reduction in safety and security in industries like airlines and a massive decline in competency and profits for big businesses.

Most of their power comes from being able to determine loans and investment from the magic money printer, based on bullshit like DEI and muh social impact. I hate the money printing. But if it's going to exist, it needs to be getting invested based on financial fundamentals, not being used to social engineer.

And so what? An autistic deep dive into this accomplishes nothing. Bitching about Kotoku does nothing because they do not have an audience.

This isn't exclusive to gaming, it's happening in every sector of every market. You'd be better off making lists of every single game that had DEI consultants and posting it on Steam or putting stickers on physical merchandise than making the average person read through 100 pages of drama. That's why GamerGate 1 accomplished nothing and that's why this will subsequently accomplish nothing.

the big reason why gamergate is really important is because it leads into pizzagate that broke just a few days later or so, because of the investigations into the media owners, organizers and editors cracking down on gamers. lazy fucking nerds only noticed when it effected you personally? typical, but not unwelcome. anyway, a lot of the same orgs in the gaming industry try to snipe kids, and it's the same people. thanks for nooooticing.

part of the DEI shit they got going on early in gaming was the forced 50% winrate algo used in some games. you win too much, and suddenly your accuracy and stuff gets fucked with, you get put with really bad team mates purposely, and other sorts of things to hamstring you.

Remember the Harry Potter game release last year? I do. Trannies trolled the fuck out of the entire gaming industry until it fizzled out. That's why these companies are willing to pay protection money to DEI narrative destroyers. They are more afraid of the truly insane leftists on social media than they are of losing money.

Not the best take but I think it factors into the equation. I saw a streamer with millions of followers stop playing that game abruptly because of the wall of death threats in chat and getting reported to Twitch for hate. He didn't say anything out of the way and the game is already gay as fuck so how is it not inclusive?

I can see how someone could be coerced to pay to keep the tranny horde from breaking their knees.

It's gg2 because people are presuming integrity where none existed. Nobody trusted gaming journalism as a whole before gamergate, when the whole thing came out, normies shrugged and basically went "yeah... the fuck did you expect". The issue was that gamergatefags kept talking about it, bringing it up, and injecting an increasing political angle to it; then made themselves enemies of the mainstream which originally was moreso confused by the whole affair. Normies don't empathize with million dollar consultancy firms because anyone that has worked an office job knows their scheme. Normies aren't surprised by the existence of DEI consultants and their talent for fucking shit up beyond all belief. But all these people who haven't realized that come along and think they have discovered something incredible.
>Holy shit, these DEI consultants are sabotaging these companies, even blackmailing them!
If they worked an office job, they would already know this. And now they are using the issue to posture politically, which is just going to turn off normies from the whole thing. They are just going to associate Sweet Baby Inc stuff with QAnon and other shit. But when Sweet Baby Inc shuts down, the gg2 fags are all going to do a victory lap. Meanwhile DEI consultants are still going to be fucking shit up.

Because it's optional and you have to explicitly go for that route. Nobody cares if it's done like this, I even welcome it.
The problem with DEI is that they want you to watch (to get this socially accepted), it shouldn't be optional in their minds.
Their whole agenda is about "impact" on society, long term.

That's the thing, again, you people charge at windmills and then take credit for changing the world. People have always been suspicious of the MSM. It has always been the case that people preferred news that agreed with them over news that didn't. It has always been the case that conservatives were suspicious of what they perceived to be a left wing media complex, and that progressives were suspicious of what they perceived to be a right wing media complex. And at the end of the day, all the anti-MSM shit didn't really achieve anything. Domination of television news coverage died at the hands of the internet, a natural shift in the market, not an ideological victory. If the DEI vidya consultancy industry fails, it will fail because the broader vidya industry failed, and the DEI consultants no longer have something to parasitize. Not because some goobers on steam raided /v/ a bunch.

You aren't wrong. Companies get worked over all the time. DEI consultants aren't even the worst example. Consultancy firms will literally gut companies from the inside out, fill it out with their own muscle (often acquired from OTHER FUCKING CONSULTANCY FIRMS), and basically puppeteer the corpse of these companies like a fucking wasp. Shady consultants are soulless creatures. The only hope you have is for a competent, good CEO that genuinely cares about the long-term health of the company and prioritizes building in-house muscle over short-term gain. But investors tend to prefer the guy that cheaps out and goes for the consultants (often because these consultancy firms will convince the investors of this, again, it is a seriously fucked industry and resembles a mafia more than a business)

Investors are short sighted, tending to look at mid-term gain over very, very long-term health of the company. When a DEI consultancy firm walks in, says they should gut their companies staff and replace them with cheap, fresh out of college niggers because cheaping out on labor can make them money now; cartoon cash register noises ring inside their heads. In fact, it tends to be detached investors that favor consultancy firms.

You could stack that number into space. Listen, there are fucking DEI consultants working for fucking lumber companies and ice cream chains. It's a grift, and a grift that is absurdly easy to pull off. Companies want to tap into a larger market, DEI consultants convince these companies of their "expertise", then they leave behind a burning pile of wreckage. Sometimes they engage in borderline blackmail, encouraging companies to gut themselves so they become perpetually reliant on these consultants. There's too much money in the grift for these consultants to stop, and dumbfuck corporations like Sony aren't going to suddenly stop wanting to tap into the "minority" demographic.

Even the guys that were good at their job existed in an industry with remarkably low accountability and almost no integrity. Like I said, nobody with a brain trusted gaming journalists to begin with. At most, they might find the guy they considered the most honest; but that honest guy could just as easily be paid off as anyone else. It was a shitshow before Gamergate, it was a shitshow after. Gamergate goobers shouldn't take credit for "restoring integrity to gaming journalism" or whatever the fuck, because that was never a goddamn thing.

Likewise, consultancy firms are not a new thing. Consultancy firms shaking down companies, even fucking downright blackmailing them, is not a new thing. Diversity consultants, also not a new thing, and it sure as hell doesn't exist because of the evil wokies. Or rather, the supply side couldn't give too shits about "wokeness", for the consultancy firm, it's an easy shakedown. Find some dumbfuck CEO, convince him that your DEI consulting will somehow help the company (sometimes with a bit of coercive language), shake him the fuck down. Money has no smell and the only color these consultants acknowledge is green. If you had ever dealt with a shady consultancy firm or paid attention to the consultancy industry prior to Sweet Baby Inc, you would know this. But people only suddenly care about the consultancy industry, curiously whenever it allows them to insert their politics into it, it's almost as though the entire thing is just a pretense to whine about niggers on a video game board.

They weren't just hobbyist blogs, the guys who worked at 1up were genuinely good at their job but you can see the cultural split even within a show like GFW radio, shawn elliott would go on to work at irrational and arkane and would call out the some of the game journalists for being vapid virtue signallers, then you have jeff green who was cool but would go on to work for one of these consultancy firms that advocate for DEI.

Consulting has always existed but the shift in the video journalist space in California was drastic, people who were relatively normal transformed into cult members over the course of a few years and re-wrote their entire lifes purpose to be about pushing far left politics. These people created a new kind of consultant that was about politics instead of the relatively innocent pre-review analysis it used to be.

One of the things I enjoyed the most about the original Gamergate was how many progtards and paid shills went mask-off, even here. The more they tried to control the narrative the clearer it became what they were doing.
Here’s a tip, the only way a thread like this would annoy a cunt like you is because you’re on the side, politically or culturally, of the DEI dipshits busy trying to use gaming as a subversion and indoctrination tool. And so in here you come, spewing your ‘election tourist’ catchphrase like a good little leftist online footsoldier, determined to strike a blow against the big bully gamers who are victimising the poor little multimillion dollar companies by not buying their games.

How about this? How about if you don’t like this discussion, you simply avoid it, the way more and more gamers are avoiding wokeshit made by anti white racists?

founding group builds an IP of value
group gets big enough to be scrutinized
they inevitably dont have enough women
they add women but suddenly there's personality conflicts that didnt exist before
women are in by fiat to you either take the women's side or you have to go
drain on creative personality types, the kind who constantly talk about their balls and fart extra loud or will proudly announce they had diarrhea. The guys actually coming up with the ideas.
bereft of ideas they turn to snake oil salesmen who are selling 100% DEI compliance as their first priority.
>and here it is
A consulting agency gets money from corporations on a 0 labor job that cannot be financially quantified. In other words, the kind of people who live fucked up life styles desire these jobs so they can rape kids and do drugs in fancy hotel rooms instead of shitty ones.

i don’t need a long spun argument. i hate jews, they’re phenotypic expression is disgusting.Parts of their religion suck infant cock, and they’re naturally arrogant by disposition. This is reflected in Israel considering the USS Liberty, and the fact that Israel has never fought alongside the US in any of our interests,we only fight alongside them in their interests (i.e Desert Storm, Iran).

I work in law and have witnessed kikery in action firsthand via the public defenders office worshipping niggers, pressing insanely hard for dei hires, and wasting space in private offices i’ve had the displeasure of working in. it’s important to understand how the jew mind works, it takes the “higher” and defines it as the “lower”, Freud , jew, defined consciousness as sex, Marx, Jew, defined history as economy. You'll find many more. Use this to cleanse yourself of jew think, or honestly kill yourself boomer kike dick-sucking faggot.

This is the kind of assumption they're banking on that completely and utterly ignores the literally dozens of negative opinions being given by people who would have been happy to support if they'd just put a White guy there postinf before you. This shit is designed to be antagonistic when every single White guy is a faggot, evil, or incompetent. No black guys are ever painted in a bad light, and don't get called out for ridiculous shit like "do black girl magic" like they deserve. The show will likely tank because they're going to go for fantagonism against their core fan base. It's failed for at least a decade but the DEI requirements have created a formula no one knows how to stop any more.

The woke hustle is just the easy part of this shit. They are trying to commodify EVERYTHING and take ownership of things that belong to everyone.
Only reason woke shit is in the equation is for a company like Apple using slave labor in China to balance out their ESG score.
And the best part is they are going to charge YOU for the imaginary do good stakes in made up markets.

If normies cared, sure, but I think you're overestimating the power of /pol/ in videogame and movie sales. Why does Disney keep pumping the movies that they do despite all the critic and fan backlash these past few years? They doubled down even. Bud Light overestimated how replaceable as a beer they were. Media is different. Each product is unique. How will you replace the fact that you're now bored? Will you take up other hobbies? Will you try to find other games that are made by lesser devs and lesser budgets that provide you with a DEI free experience but clearly an inferior visual or gameplay experience?

This is a good, main point that I have no issue with. And it's clearly true - DEI games score horrendously when it comes to user reviews and are constantly shit on by indie studios, yet they show no signs of stopping.
Whether or not the games are turning a profit, Fink doesn't give a shit. They can easily spend 5 million of a 10 million dollar budget on marketing and manage to make the 150k sales needed to make a profit off of a super bowl ad and birthday/christmas gifts to children.
It may not be insane success, but it's some amount of profit and that's good enough when your hands are in enough cookie jars. CEOs get bonuses, a few game developers commit suicide and the portfolio goes up 2%. Everybody who matters wins.
Even if they don't profit - it doesn't matter to anyone other than the game studio. Losses on investments are expected in finance, and when your cousin runs the money printer... oh well. Money well spent to push your "Greater ideal" aka ideology.

Just sounds like a conspiracy theory that excuses you from realizing what's going on in the sociopolitical space that also enables DEI to propogate. You want to conflate ESG and Blackrock because, but it's not just that, and I find many oil execs hate Larry Fink because of his push for green energy so they try to subvert every cultural issue of DEI in that direction of ESG. But really we're fed up with the constant force feeding of "diversity" and emasculation of men in general.

Maybe DEI is more popular with their investors, maybe the sales are good enough to meet revenue targets. All it means is no one on /pol/ boycotting those games is going to change shit, right?

Sweetbaby is a pointless DEI group that exists solely to pozz games and make money off of retarded devs who want brownie points.
Some Brazilian made a Steam group a few months back that simply read, "here's a list of games these guys worked on" and nothing else. Recently, the head of SB found out about this and sperged out, demanding her followers to get the group and his account banned off Steam, but this just led to the group getting 200,000+ members in span of a week and bringing a fuckload of attention to Sweetbaby and other similar groups. Very similar to GG, but only time will tell if it spirals into a shitshow of that magnitude.

But at some point they have to make revenues to justify most investors they are worth their price. Investors like Blackrock aren't charities and only care about making money.

The entire reason for DEI is for DEI investor money. It's not "Sales" they care about - it's money. Easy to get the two confused.
They know the consumers hate it, but they can trade a certain amount of commercial success for some crumbs off of Larry Fink's plate.
It's obvious that any game with a budget of over a couple million will be loaded with DEI. It's how they get the budget in the first place.
It's also the reason why smaller studies with much less money are consistently blowing AAA studios out of the water in game quality and user reviews.
Simply put, it's jewish tricks.

The only thing that game publishers care about is sales. You will still probably buy the next DEI game that subversively tricks you into supporting DEI and there are no game reviewers out there who will have access to games before sales if they don't support DEI so you'll have to wait for user reviews. And do international audiences have the cultural awareness of what they're being force fed? For all the outrage out there about DEI in media, especially movies, there doesn't seem to be enough backlash on sales for then to stop.

nobody seems to be talking about the most sickening aspect of this. it's called SWEET BABY because they focus on shoving DEI shit into games that they KNOW children will play. they're literally trying to make your baby "sweet" (i.e. not racist not homobhopic not antisemitic etc). a great example of this is the new spidercuck game. I have NEVER met ANYONE who even considered buying this game. but I do know someone who's friends with a marveldad who bought it for their fucking 5 year old son

Can someone explain how this is not a racket?

-DEI consultant agency provides their services to be more inclusive.

-This same DEI company uses subversive methods like bots, DDOS, and probably even false flags to pressure companies to use their services

-They create faux outrage online and then use that fake outrage to try and bully these companies into employing their services

-They also have assets at media companies carrying water for them and covering up how damaging they have been to vidya.

The best response to the leftist pilpul on this subject is just to point out that none of the best games or films throughout history ever needed consultancy firms or any sort of DEI bureaucracy. That forces them in to a corner where they have to concede that these things aren’t actually necessary, and they’re then forced to argue their merits on entirely ideologically charged grounds.

You are wrong. They are being forced; you're just ignoring how they're being forced. Sweet Baby isn't the one pulling the levers; the investors are. If they don't play ball their ESG score tanks and they're shut out of the easiest, most lucrative investments available to them. They hire these consulting firms to signal to DEI-laced investors that they're good subservient goyim and they need money. They promise to make all of the correct propaganda in exchange for a paycheck.

So they are in fact pressured to hire these consulting companies, and listen to every suggestion made. It's called coercion.

If appeasing some fucking guy's opinion becomes more important than creating good products for customers, then EVERYTHING will die, not just gaming.

[18][19] Further news about coffee reached Italy through Prospero Alpino in 1592. In 1645 Venice, Oxford in 1650 and London in 1652 had coffee houses. In France, such institutions were established in Marseille around 1659. In 1672, an Armenian opened a coffee shop in St. Germain. The first Parisian café is Café Procope, which was opened around 1689 by the Sicilian Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli.

(or any marginalized person, for that matter) can only offer up content that is based on their identity is incredibly frustrating for the team—and for marginalized industry members at large. ”People can’t imagine that we might do anything else but DEI,” Belair says. “They can’t imagine that we’re just talented writers, that we’re talented narrative designers and that people are hiring us because we tell good stories, because we collaborate well, and because we write video games. They have to diminish our accomplishments to our identities. They can’t imagine that the work I did on Spider-Man was story work versus adding pride flags, you know?”
They can’t imagine that the work I did on Spider-Man was story work versus adding pride flags. — Kim Belair, Sweet Baby Inc.

>Despite the intensity of the backlash over the past few weeks, it’s business as usual for Sweet Baby Inc. The companies they work with haven’t been scared off—they’ve actually offered advice and best practices for how to move forward, practices they have developed after facing harassment of their own, Belair tells me. With that kind of support in their corner, and a shared love for writing good stories, the team at Sweet Baby Inc. is determined to forge on and keep working on a litany of games—both announced and under wraps.

OH NO NO NO NO

/v/ was wrong again.

>Sweet Baby Inc. is not the largest narrative design company in the games industry. Nor is it solely responsible for the characters and stories in recent high-profile releases like Alan Wake 2, God of War Ragnarok, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. But good luck telling some gamers that.

>Though these kinds of social media posts argue that companies like Sweet Baby Inc. somehow “force” game studios to include diverse characters and storylines, the reality is vastly different. Sweet Baby Inc. is a narrative design company, meaning most of its work is focused on writing stories and dialogue—they are not a DEI consultancy firm. That means they ensure a game’s plot points make logical sense and are satisfying to players, and that characters speak and behave in consistent ways. Narrative designers may also provide a final round of polish, like a Hollywood “script doctor.” For example, the team worked on Suicide Squad long after the story was written—and even then they joined just to write in-game ads, audio logs, and NPC “barks,” CEO Kim Belair tells me over video call.

They win because they are out strategizing you. That's a bitter pill isn't it? You play games which should make you a better strategic thinker.
You have to play their game against them.
One counter strategy is acceleration.
Make media accounts, accuse them of NOT doing enough to DEI over games. Copy paste some of their ridiculous left wing cringe rants you see and apply it to games. Make game publishers the equal of the Disney Star Wars franchise. Make games so fucking insufferable that the companies collapse fast. That will get rid of these fucks. Then play old games until some decent arises from the ashes.

For a good laugh watch the Critical Drinker talk about this shit.

They have been around since before goongate as Digra with their circle of "peer review" studies all done in an incestuous relationship with each other. One of their early projects for mass manipulation was EVE online. They proto typed the whole gamers are dead shut it down narrative there years before.

SA goons were big in the game and from SA forums weird twitter pushed the whole thing and stoked the flames. They also unleashed the tranny menace at the same time. It's all a funny coincidence or perhaps inevitable given EVE was the most sociopath centric place they could start out from which explains their tactics.

I would invite people to stop actually being outraged and see the silver lining. Everything they touch should rightly fail. Everything inspired by DEI is having a horrible time. The second gaming crash is upon us at the same time AI is going to relieve even more dead weight from the picture. So from a gaming standpoint nature is healing. All the going under and negativity is normie repellent but the autist know that new tech and adversity will usher in a better age of gaming.

All you have to do is watch and laugh.

this post does NOT do justice to the horrors that Arenanet has done. honestly the best and quickest way to summarize it for anyone not familiar with guildwars

Guildwars 1 team was not the same team who created Guildwars 2. additionally, guildwars 2 bears little if ANY resemblance to the spirit and gameplay of guildwars 1. the only thing they share is the setting.

it's a god damn shame. i fucking LOVED guildwars 1, put in thousands of hours. guildwars 2 genuinely pissed me off so much, ive never ever in my entire life been so angry at a company, product, or people i dont even know. guildwars 2 literally made me feel like an overreacting autist. just seeing images and memes about it gets my blood to rise.

and its not even the DEI that made it a horrible game, it's literally the game itself. fuck arenanet and all of the people responsible for guildwars2 i hope they all stub their toes really hard and split their toenail.

hi /v/eddit I just wanted to say that if you want to attack the source of this as in not just pointless memes and green frogs but actually strike where it hurts the most, you must turn against the US government and make this about destroying the cultural imperialism of the state department. This is not about just a random company or two, or some trannies organizing a tranny mafia to extort DEI policies out of businesses, this is actually the central state and DARPA trying to recreate the "torches of freedom" bullshit of the 20th century that eventually metastasized into the Democracy LARP, and they're trying to spin up the same freedom that would target the same dividing lines of human sexuality that would predictably turn into the same geopolitical cultural imperialism that would be wielded by the envisioned future America that would invade countries for these "freedoms". If you want to hurt them for real, target the cultural imperialism in advance. The last GG targeted just gaming companies and journalists, and it lost, because your enemies resorted to institutional support up to the UN and encircled you. At the end of the day you (we) were just a bunch of useless teenagers stuck on some online imageboard. If you want to win, you need to elevate to the ideological and geopolitical level and encircle them first.

This is the conclusion that you will reach after more than a decade of lurking /pol/ and /new/ so let me save you the trouble and spoonfeed you directly. You need an ideology and you need a geopolitical stance. Or you will lose.

But it won't sell more in the west because of this, FF people don't care, and the people who do don't actually play FF.

Also, what did they "comb over"?
Cloud is white, aerith is white, tifa is white, sepiroth white, hojo white, Rude white, Reno white, Rufus white, Leslie white, Corneo white, Kyrie/Yuffie white, Elmyra white, Madam M white, Julian white, Jessie Biggs and Wedge all white, Zack white, Red is red, Cait is big and white, Barret is black like in OG, and like in OG kinda stereotyped as he remains modelled on mister T. Some of the uninteractable NPCs are black, that's oretty much it.

If this is the result of DEI consulting I am not sure what exactly they did, the game is pretty white qnd follows the OG pretty closely in its casting.

The entire point of these companies is to put out games that make them attractive to American dei/esg. A company that loses 10 million on a game that panders to the banks is better off than a company that makes 10 million and doesn't pander.

I think it'll be a disappointment, whoever he picks. He should pick Vivek or JD Vance, someone younger who knows what time it is and is on the same page with him. No blacks, no women, I make special exception for Vivek to the "no jeets" rule only because he is based enough to warrant it.

He should be picking someone who can keep moving the ball, not a Jeb! in DEI-approved clothing.

Cool proxy, but Sweet Baby is a symptom of the problem, not the cause. They are a small consulting firm that genuinely believe in what they are doing, and they do contribute to the decline of the industry, but it's these AAA developers that are the ones seeking them out and paying them to do this shit in order to receive investments from trillion dollar companies like Black Rock and Vanguard. The video game industry is just one front in the efforts going on in the background to push DEI, ESG (since rebranded into multiple different acronyms to make it harder to follow), and other similar programs into the corporate and cultural sphere.

And yes, the backlash against ESG for the last few years has cost these companies billions. But when you have trillions of dollars worth of assets at your disposal like Larry Fink does there comes a point when losing incomprehensible amounts of money for the average person is completely meaningless. The real question is what do Blackrock and Vanguard get out of this?

Hollywood like the video game industry is fake and gay. Both are being controlled by Blackrock funding their ESG/DEI bullshit to both in order to attack and remove white people through guilt or silencing them on social media.

Remember when the credit rating agencies where deeply involved in the 2008 financial crisis? Seems this shit is new iteration of the kikes' blackmail bullshit. Apparently the "trick" is a mob-style bullying where refusing to get rated amounts to getting your company fucked seven ways to sunday. They did the same with ESG where your funding depended on giving cunts like Robin DiAngelo her speaking fees and allowing DEI infiltration of your enterprise to stay on the good side of BlackRock et al.
Got to be the same strongarming here. Games need cash in advance to get developed, so there's obviously plenty of leverage for kikes to demand certain conditions to greenlight your project.

They're separate, you're just used to speaking broadly about them so you can make the issue seem bigger. On one hand, a company is free to make the mistake of having a group of professional wokies make their game less "problematic", on the other DEI hiring is a practice that hurts job opportunities for white people. The same logic that goes into hiring Sweet Baby is the same that goes into hiring ethnic Europeans for consulting on their culture issues too when you want to make something Norse with cool Norse runes. Someone needs to tell you vikings didn't wear horned helmets.

a feminist tranny faggot slept with a bunch of game journalists and developers in the industry for favors and all game reviews are rigged and paid for. DEI is mandated by publishers trying to capture and grow their share of the market. Some developers are complicit but all sponsored studios are under the control of their publishers pushing bullshit and kike invaders.

One femanon had a developer or two kill themselves on false rumors and another one with a god complex infiltrated the US government and made a failed bid for a seat in congress.

All of this came to light and the gross response was for the industry to officially proclaim 'gamers are dead' and also incels, because they were found out.

Now it happens again but this time with a DEI think tank in bed with AAA games publishers.

It's a company that provides a Kosher stamp for game developers. This company is the intermediary between developers and the dei Jewish criminal racket.

The developer sends their product to sweet baby games so that the Jewish Marxist troons can retool it to fit their political agenda before it goes to mass market. If they don't, then the game gets no exposure and no market.

so corporations sell out to them, because there's these other kikes who own the banks of the countries. banks are privately owned.
and then there's these other kikes who are politicians of the countries as well

it's all propped up by freemasons who are basically a brotherhood of cops

I mean c'mon, he worked directly under George Soros on an UN committee for sustainable economic and ecological development; his goal was to eliminate the rise of the political right, and yes, he seems to have, very fortunately, decisively failed. His goal was to subvert and ultimately destroy the rise of identitarianism in Europe. And allow for replacement migration to utterly erode the peoples, cultures, and values of Western civilization. But I digress. The most pressing question is: What's the deal with Elon?

As of 2024, Elon has:

>Opposed DEI policies
>Opposed anti-white sentiments
>Opposed Immigration
>Opposed Soros

It feels organic, but hey, that's how Jordan Peterson was perceived. The anti-semitic thought that has been endorsed is odious to me in particular, but I'm not certain. The media has vigorously clashed with Musk, while Jordan Peterson was elevated. Again, we know how this works; they cultivate a loyal base of disciples who believe their leader to be a prophet, but of course, as it unravels to the astute eye, all is revealed. They subvert the beliefs of their followers, and, therefore, well, they subvert! They shift the overton window; if I were you, I'd look closely at his tweets, as these things are often shifty if you're astute. We could be subject to next-level subversion.

(And yes, I know that he wants to put chips in our heads, but it's not relevant to the discussion)

Discuss.

Government "guidance", rather than law. It's like saying "we're not telling you to do this but we strongly recommend you do it or else" or like a gang demanding protection money saying "nice place. it would be shame if something happened to it".
Maybe DEI training isn't enforced by law, but if someone reports the company then the government will sue them or punish them somehow.

they're looking for a scapegoat as to why no one wants to join the military.
it CAN'T be dei/diversity/affirmative action,
so what is it?
obviously, it being unmarried.
being unmarried is why no one wants to join the military.
and, now there's a paper that says so.

>>Europe starts war machine to wean itself off US weapons
Good. Though I think US would probably go to war against us for this reason alone. They've been committing terrorist acts to thwart Europe from becoming a competitor.
>>The European Commission presented a far-reaching defense industrial strategy and a €1.5B subsidy program.
Okay..... does it include DEI and a mandatory employment quota of 90% pajeets shittng lubricating every wheel of the machinery?
>>BRUSSELS — The European Union is no longer just a peace project.
Never has been. It was always a consolidation of power at the detriment of the commoner, and reducing the possibility of popular revolt.
>>On Tuesday, the European Commission presented a European Defence Industrial Strategy alongside a subsidy cash pot of at least €1.5 billion called the European Defence Investment Programme.
Okay. Under what command and under what regulations and restrictions?
>>Thierry Breton, the industry commissioner, underlined during the presentation of the strategy that Europe is facing an "existential threat," while foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned: “In response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the EU must bolster its defense capabilities.”
What threat? The one we were complicit in causing? Do nation states have a article-5 equivalent or sorts? If one actor walks into a cave with a sleeping bear, fucks the bear in the ass, and whispers in its ear "this cave is big enough for both of us", yet gets mauled to death. Are we required to invade the cave and kill the bear?
>>If member countries agree, it will mark the end of the post-Cold War peace dividend that
saw military spending shrivel.

What entity would hold ultimate command of this army? God? Or the degenerate trannies currently screeching about lgbtq rights in the muslim world?

>isn't RISC basically assembly?
No. RISC is an open and simplified version of shit like x86_64 and ARM that doesn't charge you out the ass to use the architecture and sell chips implementing it. The only downside is that using it means you have to recompile /everything/ since existing x86_64 binaries won't work but in practice that means you only need to write some gcc compiler extensions (which has already been done) and mod whatever specific project to patch architecture-specific code
>also, which is the least glownigger programming language?
Probably assembly, but if you're talking higher level it's the one you write yourself. That said, C/C++ is the best that has widespread use or a LISP if you want to go old school

Black criminals are completely out of control. The LGBT+ movement has jumped the shark and has become detrimental to society in the slippery slope way conservatives warned about during the gay marriage debate. Women using birth control, having abortions, sleeping around, filing for casual divorce, normalizing sex work and pornography are crushing the family, the institution of marriage, and the birth rate. The jews are quarterbacking the entire agenda for all parties. The jewish-black-gay-suburban women coalition agenda produces the rot we see in all major cities and specifically the tent cities in California, Oregon, and Washington. Your ideology is a failure. Communism has always also been a failure. DEI fails vs meritocracy. Queers are and always have been mentally ill. Their acceptance stems from the amount their illness affects others and society. We're at the point where they are a net negative when we see the trans and pedophile normalization. Conservatives are correct to speak I'll of each group in the coalition and desire to effect changes required for a properly functioning society up to and including the wholesale sacking of our federal and many state bureaucracies, and the expelling of certain individuals who aren't compatible or capable of working and playing well with others under the social contract that protects individual freedom but celebrates and supports the family, small business, and the local schools, faiths, and communities first in support of the families and productive individuals.

DEI is a luxury belief system, and we are not in times of luxury.
However, the ideas behind DEI are baked into every academic field right down to the pedagogy, so don't expect it to disappear.
In fact, expect it to become a stand alone system not requiring codification or enforcement. Women have been the majority of graduates for a while now, and they will continue to run the longhouse.

I was opening up a new investment account here in the UK. Didn't realise until a month later that despite it not being advertised whatsoever in the fund I picked that it had automatically allocated about 30% of the fund into ESG and DEI shit. This was moneybox for any bong bros. I picked them because they offer a LISA with the lowest fees. You can manually select funds as well so it's worth noting that if you open an account with them to check and see if they're trying to fuck you over because political or not, you'll make less money from ESG funds and this could fuck with saving for a deposit, retirement, etc.

Herbert's original vision might be a contemplation on the bullshit messiah delusion christianity visited upon us, where Paul struggles between wanting to free the people of this "someone will come and save us"-idiocy and the realization that you might as well be better off if you exploit the narrative.
The movie turns that into a jewish messiah story that doesn't even try to cater to anyone else except with the superficial DEI crap. Now you got atheist jew (Chani/Zendaya) vs. messianic jew (Paul), so this is basically kikes debating among themselves in metaphor how beneficial the whole third temple superstition is.
To drive the point home that the movie isn't for you, Paul realizes that he's a white during the movie (i.e. he's Harkonnen, who are portrayed entirely alien in their whiteness). Realizing that, he embraces his heritage (jewishness, ofc) instead and kills the white champion to take the throne of all thrones to become emperor.
It's a shit movie, not made for you or me, and a waste of time to watch unless you have some professional excuse to. They even cut a lot of the interesting fiction that used to whisk you away into a different world with different mechanics to just center on the whole messianic prophecy that's obviously more relevant to kikes.

I remember having a five minute conversation with a troon once cause they got pissed I used the word "dude" with a coworker and they hated the gendered language in the workplace. More than a few of my coworkers jumped ship too cause they got so fed up with LGBT crap infesting every part of the studio.
I'm now working IT at a boring ass medical company and somehow enjoying it more, cause people just do their job and I'm not plagued by ten emails a week about DEI or faggot shit.

I suffered together with some other bros that had shit dating prospects as well. We had fun every weekend while being under employed in our careers. Eventually towards our late 20's/early 30's, guys in my circle of friends started peeling off and dating more as we became more established and successful. It was demoralizing at times, because you think you'll be a poor loser forever, but most of us eventually started climbing the social ladder as we became more "marketable." There was no light switch approach for me. That said, DEI wasn't as big then as it is now. So when it comes to establishing yourself, you'll probably have a harder time in a corporate environment than being a self-starter tradie or some other role.

Good point. As a manager your options are:

>b.) Be fair and make the woman do actual work. She'll sue you for discrimination, you'll get fired, and your wife will divorce you because you no longer have an income.

Yes. It works today in a handful of usecases - and we're at the early days still.

That is the room for improvement we're going though with vertical farming just now.

Great for individuals, not efficient for industrial production.

Oh no! Only 4 harvests left, right? Just like we've herd from you idiots since the 60s. Soil does get degraded for sure, but it's not in danger of becoming useless for the vast majority of the agricultural land. It simply means we need to rotate crops and improve other practices to be more sustainable (and I mean that in the technical way, not DEI way).

>What happens if this thing that won't happen, happens?
Every time I see someone parrot the "AI" marketing bullshit, it's painfully obvious that they've never actually tried using any of this trash in a productive sense.

Current gen "AI" and arguably, the model they're using period, is dangerously close to the limits of what can be done. They point at the sudden advances, and infer that there will be equivalent advances, but that's unlikely. The technology relies on vast swathes of data for it to gobble up, unique data, and most importantly, data that hasn't been intentionally salted with poison, or otherwise gated behind shit meant to make harvesting it difficult.

All of the free lunch is mostly gone, if they want to advance at this point, they'll need to contend with people poisoning data that they could otherwise steal for free. And current gen spits out slop that looks like it might work, only to find out that it doesn't even compile. Then you spend time fixing it so it at least compiles, only to find out that it's given you something that doesn't even solve the problem you wanted solved, so you have to sift through the pajeet tier trash (because it's just given you an amalgamation of what it hoovered up from stack overflower, which is mostly pajeet garbage) to MAYBE salvage what it gave you.

OR, you just code the shit yourself, in less time, and you know there isn't some weird security flaw in one of the hundreds of lines of code you took from the "AI". Pajeets will probably lose their jobs, entry level positions will become harder to get, and a lot of the mid level "tech" jobs that mostly went to DEI hires and women, will probably go away too. But the people who actually produce in tech, will still have jobs.

You cannot name a single thing in this world more evil and demonic than abortion. Abortion murders babies, damages mothers and creates a culture that views ALL human life as disposable. It's because our culture tolerates abortion that we tolerate mass murder, shootings, allowing needy people to die, abuse of the vulnerable and many other horrible things. Abortion has cemented Neo-Malthusian thinking and eugenics in our culture as every abortion is a eugenic abortion.

Over 66 MILLION preborn babies have been aborted in America alone since 1973 which is more dead Americans than in every war America has been involved in COMBINED. No war, famine or even genocide has killed that many in such a short amount of time.

You cannot tell me there's anything more evil than the murder of the most innocent of all people.

There wouldn't be any incentive for shitskins to enter your country without poor border/migration restrictions enacted by your government, and without DEI initiatives. Corporations are forced, under a violation of the right to freedom of association, to hire people who are incompetent or downright malicious. The retards in charge have no perspective on what a free market is.
The US constitution specifies the right to "freedom of association," which means that you are free to associate or not associate with anyone you want. If you do not want to hire niggers, you are free to not hire niggers. If you run a club, you are free to exclude anyone from your club for any reason. This is freedom. What our governments have done is violated their own contract with their own people.

The laughter and lyrics of "Feel Good Inc." create an ironic atmosphere that resonates with the unethical actions of Judge Borrello. The juxtaposition of feeling good and the dystopian reality highlights the facade of justice, while the lyrics metaphorically describe the breakdown of a system under the weight of corruption and discrimination. Judge Borrello's involvement in a DEI Committee further underscores the importance of genuine commitment to ethical principles, beyond mere appearances.

While Borrello hides within the shady recesses of his judicial office, avoiding accountability, the windmill portions emphasize the importance of transparency and openness. The windmill's blades gracefully turn, capturing the essence of an individual earnestly striving for a fair and just experience. It symbolizes the innocence and purity of intentions that the intern brought to the judicial environment. The intern's experiences, marked by discrimination and the quest for justice, become a spiritual odyssey, echoing the mystic's call to turn inward and seek a direct, experiential connection with the divine or transcendent reality.

The description of a "new horizon" with an "ephemeral style" and a "melancholy town where we never smile" resonates with the thematic elements of the dystopian reality Judge Borrello contributes to. The pursuit of personal gain and discrimination create a town devoid of justice and fairness, characterized by a lack of genuine smiles and ethical conduct.

Judge Borrello's prior involvement in a DEI Committee, aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, adds an ironic layer. The disconnect between his participation in such a committee and his discriminatory actions underscores the superficiality of some diversity efforts and the importance of genuine commitment to the principles they advocate.

The lyrics hint at an "ephemeral style" and a "melancholy town where we never smile," reflecting the ethical deterioration and lack of joy resulting from Judge Borrello's actions. The impact on the innocent intern and the erosion of trust in the legal system contribute to the metaphorical town where genuine smiles are absent.

“Such an international state will not be established merely by the framing and acceptance of a federal constitution designed to accomplish these objects. It must prove its reality and efficacy to itself and the world. But if such a commonwealth were established and survived for some generations, the spirit which gave it reality would grow, as the spirit which now makes the United States the strongest national commonwealth in the world has grown. The transference of American loyalty from the state to the Union was a gradual process. Having adopted the constitution, they elected their president and members to Congress, they obeyed its laws and paid its taxes. All unconsciously as years went by they came to think of the Union rather than the State as the unit for which they were called on to live and to die. They awoke to the fact that the larger loyalty had raised their life to a higher plane, which was not consistent with slavery in their midst. In the end the great majority were found willing to devote their property and their lives to destroying slavery for the sake of the Union. - Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God by Lionel George Curtis, Page 917

“And so it will be with the first international commonwealth which survives for one or two generations. It will silently draw to itself the devotion of the peoples who agree to form it. They will recognize in time, and the world outside them will recognise, that their national life has not been impaired by the transfer of sovereignty to a larger unit, but has, in fact, been raised to a higher plane. The possibility of an international state composed of nations separated by oceans will have been demonstrated to the world. The gulf which at present exists in men’s minds will have been bridged.” - Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God by Lionel George Curtis, Page 917-918

>>460621013
“By these and other provisions of the Covenant functions were imposed on the League of Nations which were those of a world government. Its opening words clearly implied that international law was henceforward established as the paramount law of mankind. It remained for experience to prove whether the League was endowed with the powers necessary to discharge the functions imposed upon it; whether, in fact, the powers required by a world government could be based on a covenant made between sovereign states.” - Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God by Lionel George Curtis, Page 674-675

“I believe that, unless conscious and effective steps are taken towards that goal, the level of civilisation we have now reached cannot be maintained. It is even in danger of falling in ruins, as it fell in the Dark Ages. But the project of a world government is not in sight till two or more commonwealths, more advanced than the rest, have recognised these truths, and by some immense spiritual effort have consciously merged their sovereignties in one international commonwealth. In order to do this they must create one government more competent 'than their separate governments to control the relations of the people it represents to the rest of mankind. That government must handle the issues of peace and war, and must have the forces necessary for that purpose. It must, therefore, have power to tax not the national states which compose it, but the citizens of those states. It must draw its authority to levy these taxes from the citizens themselves and not from their national governments.” Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God by Lionel George Curtis, Page 916-917

Lionel George Curtis was one of the founders of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatahm House), the British Roundtable Group. In 1919 Curtis led a delegation of British and American experts to organize the Royal Institute of International Affairs, originally the British Institute of International Affairs, during the Peace Conference of Paris. During the Second Boar War, served as a secretary to Lord Alfred Milner. After Milner’s death, he became the second leader of Milner's Kindergarten, making him a leading figure in the administration of the Roundtable Group network.

He was lecturer in colonial history at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of All Souls College. For reference, All Souls College was a base of operations for the Roundtable Group network.

Lionel George Curtis was an active proponent for a Federal World Government. He also founded the quarterly The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs journal, specializing on Commonwealth of Nations Affairs.

Lionel George Curtis wrote a book titled Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God, arguing that America must be reintegrated into the British commonwealth and then the Commonwealth must evolve into a world government.

Let us, as acolytes of esoteric wisdom recognize that the true journey into the sacred "light" requires not only intellectual pursuit but a surrender to the religious impulse that dwells within the sanctum of our being—a journey that transcends the written and spoken word, leading us into the luminous realms of profound spiritual illumination. Turn your attention to another passage gracing Page 254, where General Hitchcock unveils the profound aspirations of the Alchemists in their quest for the New Birth.

>"The Alchemists, as I have said, were earnestly employed about the New Birth, and though they called it Donum Dei, they inquired into it as a work of nature within nature; for with them, it was a maxim that nature dissolves nature, nature joins nature, nature loves nature, nature amends nature, nature perfects and is perfected by nature. Therefore, I have said that Alchemy was religious philosophy, or was so intended by the Alchemists, right or wrong, and that they were not in pursuit of gold."

The sacred devotion to the concept of the New Birth - the Alchemists, in their earnest pursuit, christened it "Donum Dei," the Gift of God - is approached as a work of nature, and so is natural function governed by nature's laws. The maxim embraced by the Alchemists resonates with the rhythm of the universe—nature dissolving and joining itself, nature's love mending and perfecting, a seamless symphony where the alchemy of existence unfolds. Here, within the sacred precincts of their contemplation, Alchemy emerges not as a mere pursuit of material wealth but as a profound religious philosophy—a transformative quest intended to illuminate the path toward the New Birth.

LASAGNE ALLA BOLOGNESE
Le lasagne alla bolognese sono un classico primo piatto della cucina emiliana, nello specifico della città di Bologna. Conosciute ormai in tutto il mondo, non senza rivisitazioni e ingredienti diversi, sono diventate uno dei simboli e dei capisaldi della cucina italiana.

Perfette per la tavola delle feste, si preparano alternando in teglia strati di sfoglie all’uovo con ragù alla bolognese, besciamella e parmigiano.
Una regola fondamentale per una perfetta riuscita è la scelta della carne: deve essere rigorosamente mista, maiale e manzo, per conferire maggiore sapore e la giusta quantità di grassi. Inoltre deve essere cotta per almeno due ore a fuoco lento.

Il tocco in più nel ragù è dato innanzitutto dal soffritto iniziale a base di carota, cipolla e sedano e in seguito dall'aggiunta di un bicchiere di latte: perfetto per rendere il sugo più cremoso.

Si possono utilizzare poi sia le sfoglie fresche che secche, o eventualmente prepararle in casa con la ricetta inserita nei consigli. Un'ottima variante è anche quella con le sfoglie verdi all'uovo.

Una volta assemblate, le lasagne vengono cotte in forno, per circa 30 minuti, fino a quando si forma in superficie una deliziosa crosticina.

Perfette per le domeniche in famiglia, come piatto unico durante una cena romantica o come prima portata durante il pranzo del 25 dicembre.

Ecco la ricetta passo passo per preparare le lasagne alla bolognese!

What right does the US have to control Taiwan? If they make chips we need, we should just trade for them or just buy them. Our government tried to bring chip manufacturing home but their core anti-White ideology is a poison pill that sabotages what would otherwise be a good nationalistic policy. DEI was built into the chips act as if niggers and trannies could do such a job. Jews want to dominate globally but destroy Whites domestically. You can't have both but that wont stop them from trying. Our system is anti-meritocratic and it turns out this jewish plutocracy won't be able to compete globally, let alone survive another 50 years.

DEI it the literal solution - sue the living shit out of every Jew controlled organization for being racist and keeping blacks out of management.

i've heard that explanation before but it doesn't make as much sense beyond first blush: yes, a bunch of office space became useless and a complete liability, but instituting policies to use them doesn't decrease the liability, it just makes the company feel it is offset by some saving from use that makes it more comfortable to justify
that is still in the realm of possibility (that's not the first time such retarded logic has resulted in policy) but i'm more looking at the meta reason which was SARS hype and dehype. this was what drove WFH and its withdrawal. SARS hype was pushed as an intersection of primarily left interests (see the sudden tone shift around "hug a chink" followed by "lock down everything and nationalize all industry and gib gibs" in just a couple weeks). SARS was dehyped from leftliberal interest in making the new democrat government look like the stabilizing adults in charge, to emphasize agitation about it as the result of unhinged schizo larpboomers on horse paste, and the reintroduction of longhouse workplace institutions (like HR and DEI inititiatives) that are more justified by physical presence. the negatives were then blamed on "capitalism" as a boogeyman even when they were personally involved in these decisions

Following the crash, it was revealed that the pilot, a Black man, had failed several training sessions but managed to withhold this information from his employer, Atlas Air. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation determined that the Federal Aviation Administration must devise a better system of logging airline pilot records.

the pilot received the job despite “his obvious inability to fly an airplane,” ignoring the fact that the pilot intentionally lied about his credentials.

“All of the airlines are doing their best to hire and train pilots on the basis of irrelevant criteria like their appearance. And your appearance ... has nothing to do with your ability to fly an airplane, or perform heart surgery or do anything. It’s immaterial. But on their websites, both Amazon and Atlas Air explain that diversity is paramount in everything they do.”

“The airlines are in a mad scramble to meet equity targets, meaning they are pushing safety aside in favor of ideology. People will die. People have died.”

Well the thing with DEI is that the racist 36 year old janitor has reason to think it's possible that any non-White or woman only got the job because of DEI. He doesn't get to review every single curriculum vitae when he sees a pilot get in the cabin, but he can see the race, and the explicit DEI rule is that you don't have to totally earn the spot if you're diverse.

It's society that's in for the rude awakening, and we're in it right now. These people don't just die, disappear, or even change their minds because their degrees are "useless". Their ideas and resentments permeate society until the manifest in the form of riots like BLM, or entire new industries are invented to keep propagating their ideas (e.g. DEI). This happened before in Soviet Russia with Lysenkoism and in Maoist China with the Cultural Revolution. In 60's-70's China specifically, nobody could reign in the tweens and young adults that had been educated in nothing but Mao Zedong Thought their entire lives, until eventually teenage girls were running hospitals because ("the old doctors were reactionaries"). If you think the "competency crisis" and zoomers/alphas being poorly educated is a problem now, just wait a few more years.

yeah jew/jewish is more accurate. most jews are zionists. but even the ones who arent (leftists who push race communism DEI , ultra orthodox kikes who hate the goyim and steal and rob and rape) also hate white people. they all hate white people. zionist jews and non zionist jews. they resent white people. they think killing all white people and destroying the white race , will benefit them

This. “Diversity” in practice means silencing, displacing, and eventually murdering Europeans. Let’s not kid ourselves, they hate Whites because we are the most organized group of gentiles and are capable of challenging the genocidal Zionist regime in Israel and DC. Anyone pushing the DEI agenda is a participant in Zionist terrorism.

What is it with all the UN propaganda here lately? Do they think we don't read UN documents & understand the games they're playing? Restructuring global demographics & economies via mass migration (via UNHCR & UN IOM) under the guise of DEI altruism? Think we don't notice that all western nations are sacrificing national interests in order to enact the UN 2030 agenda?

OP doesn't mention India's remittances. They also don't mention how important remittances are to the UN/World Bank 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Because how the heck else do you create global "economic equity" if not by sending the 3rd world to the west to siphon off money to send back home? How else are you going to achieve global "equity" by 2030?

India is #1 in the world for remittances. Both the World Bank and UN consider remittances an official development strategy, recommending that poor countries make remittances an official part of their development strategy & policy. Remittances are considered more important for reducing poverty than development funds + foreign aid combined.

And for those of you that don't know what "remittances" are, it's the word for when Indian migrants, refugees, expats, etc. send money (from the western nations they're currently in) back home to India, thereby boosting increasing India's GDP and "reducing poverty" in India.

Go fluff the UN somewhere else, OP. We know your game here.

northern american largest investment firms that decided one day that dei Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and ESG score is profitable and should score companies on it and promote it.
they are wrong, it is a temporary misstep in investing.

An ESG score is a way to assign a quantitative metric, such as a numerical score or letter rating, to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts undertaken by a specific organization.

DEI/ESG is a kind of totalitarian dictator shadow government.
Normal laws are passed by elected legislators for government and corporate boards.
But DEI/ESG laws are set by a small number, perhaps even a single, individual that wasn't elected and we probably don't know who it is.
It's the same thing as with communism except in communist countries everyone knows it's going on and here they try to keep it secret.
DEI/ESG officers are just commissars of the unelected and unregulated shadow government.

The problem for society is that the sustained discrimination against whites and other productive social groups over the last 30 years could become fully culturally codified as an implicit social bias, the same way that the caste system in India codifies discrimination against various skin tones despite the fact that they're all shitskns or how Asian cultures discriminate against blood types with zero scientific backing.

Dude there literally hasnt been a major commercial airline crash in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, etc. Why do the far right fags keep crying about shit that isnt happening? Also the worst airplane incident in terms of loss of life was caused by a white male pilot due to his incompetence in not waiting for a runway to be cleared. He was even the face of KLM and he fucked up that bad, the kind of fuck up u guys say black and female pilots would be the cause of. Why do none of you faggots in these DEI pilots are going to kill us all threads never mention the Tenerife airport disaster?

If every corporation and university fired every DEI person today, it would still take at least 5 years to start to undo the indoctrination that's gone on unchallenged for decades.

Is there ever going to be a point where society realizes DEI is a mistake or will we just accept plane crashes and such as routine?

Tbh bridge 2.0 iniciative which seeks to imbed dei in all aspects of a corporation and its employees is a much more serious topic than some dei consulting firm
That being said I do enjoy seeing a dei consulting company being outed

But bridge is the thing to be focused on

I hope the DEI brigade becomes even more anti-Israel and countersemitic after being laid off by Zion Ron. You know, the same guy who went to Israel where he signed Noahide Laws that are directly attacking the 1st Amendment in between gulping all that kike dick and swallow gallons of jewcum.

No, sweet baby inc MAKES the story. Companies outsource everything now, including the story. That's why modern games suck.

It’s multiple things. The biggest is that the system has gotten too big for anyone to run it. Even without the following problems the crisis would be happening, it’s just too big and too complicated and kept getting bigger and more complicated. Second is Affirmative action, DEI, combined with nepotism putting people in places they are not qualified for. These are also used to deflect criticism of people who do a bad job (you are just racist, sexist, transphobic, etc)
And yes. Boomers are part of it. Between them not stepping down from power, not stopping back from the investment market and spading down their wealth in constructive ways and the lessons they leaned in the 80s about making oneself difficult to replace via not mentoring anyone ever.
Finally, the feeling the people are stuck is leading to a general not my problemization of society. Which was what they were always going to get with that stupid “make everyone a renter” project.
