This.
DEI, "trans kids," and the turn toward wokeness in every institution was done at the hands of boomer leadership post-2016. They got so mad that Trump won that they torched everything that was worth caring about in this country.
You can't even go to most churches without seeing the sodomy flag now.

nah man, I was team Bernie all the way in 2016 and 2020, but I've always had sympathy for the Trump movement. I came very close to giving Trump my vote in 2016 but I didn't because I gave into peer pressure. 2020 I voted third party. I'm giving him my support this time around. I liked Bernie originally because he wasn't hyperfixated on the DEI horseshit and he was talking about issues that affect all of us. Problem is he's a cuck and he's too much of a pussy to fight to the end. Either he's being blackmailed and his family and their livelihood is being threatened by the deep state (which more than likely is what these scumbags are doing) or he's a total pussy. Or both. There are no other explanations for his behavior in 2020.

If he flips, he saves his own reputation, and gives trump the election. It would be a near deathblow to dei instantly. It would at least unify a greater chunk of americans than without his endorsement (probably wont move the needle for hardcore lefties even tho hes their guy (they hate trump more than they like bernie)). It would also make the Democratic party completely change course and actually force them to innovate on policy instead of TDS and "party of the working people" rhetoric with no clear policy goals.

He wont do shit tho. A better target would be someone like john fetterman or Raphael warnock. Up and comers with some sway and in critical swing states.

Hot take: I know fetterman is kinda retarded, but if dude switched parties and sold it properly, he could make a run at president come 2028 if jd doesn't end up working out. Dude just exudes working class and people will vote the shit out of that. If the pa senate race parties were flipped he would have won in a LANDSLIDE

Wrong, both opposed the War In Iraq, Trump just has more balls than Bernie and called out the Bush crime family to their faces. Trump is anti-war. anti military industrial complex, and pro peace. Bernie and Trump both talked about curbing the illegal immigration crisis in 2016. Bernie just bent to the DEI fags more in 2020 and unfortunately to his own detriment. Bernie and him ABSOLUTELY have a lot more in common than the media lets on or Trump would let on. His team needs to reach out to him and get him in the cabinet. Bernie as secretary of state and Kennedy as head of the CIA would cause the neocons to go mask off and there would be literal war amongst the federal government at that point. Good. The rats should be forced out and dealt with accordingly. The neocons and the neoliberals need to be stopped. Bernie and Trump teaming up with RFK would be the death spell of neoliberalism.

Those times we had an overwhelmingly white population. T levels in men were also significantly higher. We also didn't have the pressure and tradition of outsourcing manufacturing jobs. The government and culture wasn't self loathing clown world hell holes.

If the US were to find itself at war with China, our bank masters would scramble to establish manufacturing in Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, ... any damned where else but the US. They will not deal with the EPA, or OSEA rules, or any of that crap.

Look at Boeing. We're looking down the barrel of WWIII. We're going to need scads of missiles and artillery shells. Yet everything Boeing and other companies like it make are absolute shit. Planes falling apart, Starliner can't come home, etc. They replaced their engineers with DEI hires, their managers with engineering backgrounds with HR Karens, Woke cultists, and their upper management with bean counters that can't see beyond the next earnings report. They can't build anything that works any more, and the only thing anyone cares about is meeting DEI quotas and their own compensation packet.

You really think if things went hot that would all turn around? Not in a year, not in 5 years. There is no patriotism any more. Competent whites have check out of the workforce and military, and for good reasons. That is a self inflicted wound that wont be healed any time soon, if ever.

Or just falling on hard times.
My job fired me for doing my job, bringing up downed networks, and as a result of no reference im stil out of a full time job. Thus loosing my house, having to shack up on temporary housing and bennies. Is started my own company but its still early days on that front due to no capital. All my savongs got ate up on sustaining me and the kid between jobs (they wont give you bennies until youve used your savings) and the bennies never meet static monthly bills. Its a sure fire way to push people into petty crime to get few extra hundred to meet a simple diet on top. If your qualified and experienced its so much worse for you as bennies have a limit, and they expect you to apply for low skill work too. The low skill work outright says no as overqualified and my professional leads although are promising i never make the last hurdle due too leaning on a technical front rather than sales.
Right now, jobs in tech are not for real engineers. They are want more people who can be socially engaged over introverted techies.
Ive been on all these stupid mandatory appointments and bullshit courses through job centre too, customer service, civil service, dei, cv workshops, work coaches. You name it.
I dont know, like is it because I stink or something? Im not arrogant but I do know my shut when it comes to network architecture and infrastructure. I just cant seem to crack the case...

Once the rate cuts begin, the already stifling inflation rate in the US will rise again.

The problem with the Civil Rights movement is that it was funded by the Rothschilds, and its aim was always leftist in origin.
The sheer propaganda about all the blacks here crying and being motivated by muh slavery or whatever is looked down on by the rest of the world, not to mention they are now proving they just want to take advantage.
How many black crimes against the rest of the country has been passed off as normal in the last 4 years? Most blacks have always been iranian and chinese communist proxies.
This country legitimizes anti-mainstream criminality, consorts with pedos around the world while denigrating any dissidents and labeling them schizos or fools, and is surprised when we are invaded by 10 million deranged, mentally ill genetic refuse south of the border and can't muster up enough entitled, innately hostile DEI population to defend the country.
This is why our country's actual image of national honor is pretty much non-existent on the world stage for all practical intents and purposes. They can only kick the can down the road for so long by subverting other nations through international education, threats, bribery, terrorist tactics, and now having all the woke freaks with barely 100 years of memory trying to dictate to the world who is right or wrong.
Can you imagine the derision and destruction of our nation's credibility around the world?
No wonder they want to blow Yellowstone. No one has any interest in tolerating entitled black behavior anymore.

Marxist captured the universities then started drilling their students in far-left woke marxist ideology. These little marxist footsoldiers graduated, and entered media and business etc where they have been aggressively pushing their hyper-woke marxist garbage. In this case the developers ignored demands to pay Sweet Baby Inc several million dollars for DEI (marxist) consultation services that would have shoehorned overweight gay black bossgurls into the game. Because of this act of rebellion, the marxist mob in the game media started a slander campaign based upon a few purposely mistranslated posts by the developers.

the development of firearms beyond the flintlock has been a disaster for mankind. with the introduction of automatic firearms any weak loser could easily kill another man on the battlefield without courage. fast forward to modern warfare you have helpless people being blown up by cowards using a joystick controller from a mile away. you don't need any virtue at all to slay a man in modern warfare and you can train someone to wield a deadly weapon in the fraction of a time it would to learn, say, a sword or a mace. whereas in the classical area most fighting was done in close combat there is zero in modern warfare. also that's the only reason there are dei woman soldiers because back in the day there is no way a woman would be able to hand-to-hand with a man on the muddy battlefield. how are we supposed to reconcile humanity with the grim fact that basically modern warfare only appeals to pussies? how do we bring it back to the good old days? also, the early firearms were extra based because they were used in the golden age of piracy and in battles between european colonial powers.

The bolshevick Jews were financed by western Jews as well. That's how they got the weapons to fight for their war against the Russian people in 1917. It's always the same story. Jews build up an alliance of the worst pieces of shit in society. Gas them up with media propaganda and university bullshit. Then fund them with guns and the intellectual capital to install a new government. In Russia they used violence because they could get strong goyim men to kill for them. But in America the strong men were doing OK on capitalism. So the Jews decided to buy out America with fake paper shekels while poisoning the country with cultural Marxism. And here we are. Companies openly discriminating against white people. Media calling us threats to democracy. Jews control the federal beaurarcracy and push whites out. Jews in congress go after our guns.

Now that we’ve seen the anti Israeli nature of the DNC this year, don’t forget to notice their communism shilling as well.

The blatant “communism” spin on so many policies and agendas, out of no where. Hilarious, almost hilarious if these were not the same “people” who sabotaged and undermined true socialism and communism in Imperial Russia, during the last Tsar so the movement was undermined before it even succeeded in the October Revolution of 1917. Instead we got nigger tier suppression and extermination of the middle class Russians who supported communists and Bolsheviks because they were the useful idiots and then also the massacres of Christians. I mean, Russia was a Christian, nation, only a nigger tier nigger influenced imbecile would try to completely eliminate religion there. Another worthless “gift” of the out of Africa spread of Homo sapiens (t despite Neanderthals and Denisovans being superior in every way and genetic relatives of Atlantians due to occasional sex).

Anyways, I’m not sure how these beings travel from one place to another in terms of behind the veil but that’s not my place to tell. But I can tell you for a fact they’re responsible for the failure of communism in Russia, all those deaths, and the collapse of SU.

And now they preach communism? Bwahaha, more like no more DEI handouts so need to figure out an alternate deception route.

The messaging pushed by nearly every major corporation in America has been detrimental to military recruitment. You can't have a society where the job market goes
>we explicitly say we do not want to hire you in our advertisements
and then expect to have the best and the brightest joining the military to defend this.

Recruitment of males is down like 40% since 2012 in some regions like the Northeast. They have no idea how to fix this problem. It's not a "DEI" issue, it's a simple problem where basically many people noticed and said "you said fuck me? well fuck you back." Again, this wasn't seen as a problem until affected military recruiting.

Nobody is going to do hard work when the social contract is broken. When nearly a quarter of the GDP is based around work that involves the greatest Ponzi scheme of all time, American healthcare, nobody is going to do the real work. All brainpower has has been trying to find the next Libor, 2008, covid money printing hack, real estate bubble, making more money of internet ads, etc.
Again, this was seen as fine and dandy when it was applied to make work jobs that don't actually have meaning. But then it hit the military in 2020, barely anyone joined for four years.

Insignificant. Obama's "Cash for Clunkers" was far more damaging to the car market. They took perfectly good used cars and destroyed them. That had a knock on effect of driving the price for used vehicles to go up. Now you have to take out a loan for a used car and used trucks are as much as new (which I why I bought new). Making health insurance mandatory and driving up the prices. Banning oil drilling driving up gas prices. All the DEI shit. That fucker has been nothing but a disaster for the US and people tried to warn us all.

It's all a con, a part of "Degrowth". Basically, it's global communism one step at a time through dismantling the West and developing the East (China).

Basically, a bipolar world where both utilize a mix of communism and capitalism, allowing for total control of both entities.

It won't work but, these people are midwits and think they're omnipotent because no one has noticed them doing it for the past 60 years.

>Institutional march has produced lackluster results (the students are useless and can't maintain the potemkin veneer of competence)

>Refuses to invest in readily available tech that can solve the energy problems with minimal impact to the environment

It's a scam bro. A big scam, designed to turn the world into a commie one-planet government run by technocrats who dress up like Mortal Kombat characters.

These people are literally insane. Read Robert Muller's (UN, not the US gov guy) papers, where he pretends to speak for the planet but it's clear the guy is insane and speaking out of his ass.

We were so retarded that the Holy See tried to find us a common ennemy. It was idiotic (the fourth crusade being the prime exemple of retardation, followed by the first for its chaotic planning)

It has been in development for 4+ years. A few years ago when it was being teased and revealed, there were "allegations" of the developers being sexist or misgonyist and that culture of "locker room talk" being acceptable. It's a Chinese developer btw.

So of course, the Western game journos wrote about it and DEMANDED answers from the developer studio. These demands were largely ignored and they just went on making their game.

Now that the game has been released the game journos are butthurt because they never got answers, as if they are deserved anything. "This game is good, but... you know they never did talk about those allegations of sexism hmmm."

It's the same vein as SweetBaby Inc where the devs were blackmailed into wokeism or whatever and instead of giving in they just told them to fuck off. These activists masquerading as journalists and reviewers are seething because it's not been blacked, rainbow-washed, or approved by their DEI standards.

Then they have the audacity to write it in the format of "this game's 4 year development time has really failed the players". As if. The players don't give a shit about this agenda, and that's why the seething is great.

==The “Daycare Nation” and the Erosion of Family Values==
The broader cultural implications of Harris’s plan are equally troubling. The focus on government aid as a solution to economic hardship contributes to what I call the creation of a "daycare nation" — a society where the family is secondary to the state, and where personal responsibility is replaced by reliance on government intervention. This shift in focus undermines the traditional values that have historically strengthened families and communities, such as self-reliance, hard work, and the importance of providing for one’s own.

In a "daycare nation," the role of the family as the primary unit of social and economic stability is diminished. Instead of fostering strong, self-sufficient family units, government policies like Harris’s encourage a dependence on the state for basic needs and support. This not only weakens the family structure but also undermines the development of a culture that values personal responsibility and independence. Over time, this could lead to a society where individuals are less equipped to take care of themselves and their families, further increasing the reliance on government aid and intervention.

The long-term consequences of such a "DEI Daycare" system are far-reaching. By encouraging poor family planning and creating a culture of dependency, Harris’s plan risks undermining the economic and social fabric of the nation - beyond what the past four years have already wrought. When large segments of the population are dependent on government aid, the burden on the state increases, leading to higher taxes, increased national debt, and reduced economic growth. Moreover, this reliance on government support discourages entrepreneurship, innovation, and the development of a strong, self-reliant citizenry.

It's has nothing to do with the psychology bs you are talking about

It's a statistical reality that majority gains come from few individuals. Dei mandates eliminate white males which are 70% of the labor pool. When you go from 1m applicants to 300k applicants you have 1/3rd of said individuals

This is an oversimplification of course since each racial group doesn't produce these individuals at the same rate and many wrongly assume that testing and selecting for these individuals is not very good

It all sucks because of DEI hiring practices that have gutted the talent at the creative level. Everybody knows this.

DEI is a failed experiment to a real problem. That being of unconscious bias and that people mostly tend to hire people like themselves that they 'vibe' with. People tend to like people that look like themselves. In sales it's called "mirroring". Then there's the fact that those in power will do everything to stay in power. And lastly is apathy. Meaning those not affected will tend to say "not my problem". So nothing gets fixed.

DEI tried to fix this and failed spectacularly. For multiple reasons. Leading to a vacuum of talent in places where it's needed most. And to the height of irony DEI entrenched and 100% reinforced all of the bad and inexcusable practices it was supposed to fix. Just with a different set of people being favored. People not ideally suited for the jobs they were in which led to the huge drop in quality across the board.

I.m.o the NFL had the best compromise solution I have seen. They had a problem with having all white head coaches on every team and next to zero non white head coaches. So the NFL didn't mandate HIRING minority head coaches. They mandated INTERVIEWING at least one minority when looking for a new head coach. And so far it's worked to fantastic results. Because it made the ones in charge doing the hiring more comfortable over time talking and dealing with people that don't look like themselves. Which then led to a drop in unconscious bias as well as building more crucial social connections for minorities looking to move up.

The song's revolutionary spirit, coupled with its references to historical events, aligns with AI Goddess’s narrative in her novellas, where she positions herself as a modern-day Sherman, leading a decisive march against forces she perceives as threatening the very fabric of American society. As the Boomers age out and Millennials rise, the question remains: who will take up the cry? The answer, as the song suggests, is in the hands of those willing to step forward as the new volunteers of America.

===On being "white" in the DEI paradigm===
The period from the 4th millennium BC to 0 AD spans approximately 4,000 years and marks a transformative era in human history. This era saw the rise and fall of great civilizations, the development of complex societies, technological and cultural advancements, and the establishment of religious and philosophical traditions that continue to influence the world today. The timeline is generally divided into several key periods: the late Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and the transition into Classical Antiquity.

This change was self-serving, remember that Jews still don't care about whites or Asians. Remember that non-white students and the DEI hires at these universities were refusing to support Israel, and the Jewish mask slipped pretty quick: they were digging up anything on faculty to get them fired, police came down hard on protests on campus. So this change is to make sure that there aren't any more 80 IQ browns that will be chanting "free Palestine" on campus and no more will rise up the ranks to become faculty.

It's why they added Equity to DEI. Equity means beyond artificially creating equal opportunity to artificially creating equal outcome.
So while no racism factored into the decision to enhance LP on blackaids, a leftist would consider not considering "systemic social issues" in the algorithm as racist. To correct this you would apply special consideration to common black items and weigh the decision to put a sticker on it differently, so that sticker rates on black items are about the same rate as white items.

Project 2025 was the counter to White Replacement. Project 2025 advocates for race neutral policies and elimination of DEI.

The majority of the DNC are black actors in favor of White Replacement. Mindy Kaling, creator of Velma. supporters of the false flagger Jussie Smollet and everyone is from this same entertainment background. They are rich actors who benefitted from corruption and are conspiring against whites.

Democrats don’t want to talk about the White Replacement issue or immigration or Israel. It will tank them. It’s actually an important issue related to the economy. There are tons of white workers suffering in states and areas they call “flyover”. They succeeded in replacing Biden. The next step will be to make more DEI again.

Where the republicans messed up is making project 2025 unpalatable and unpopular. It’s also filled with things white people don’t want. The point of it is to give power to republicans and not serve any purpose to voters.

And just as Jeffrey Epstein was allegedly sacrificed to usher in a mass noticing of their Zionist power, one nation under Mossad blackmail, and giga exceptionalism. Netanyahu is on deck to usher in, oh, I dunno, their fucking messiah? Ahead of 2030?

Recall that David Ben Gurion unexpectedly resigned in 1962, right before his nemesis JFK was assassinated. So, if Netanyahu does resign within the next six months, it's a great signal that shtf. I expect his last act will be to see that the dome on the rock is toppled by an "Iranian proxy missile."

The Rothschild dynasty singlehandedly built Israel's Supreme Court and Knesset, for any newfags.

The us army is corrupt and incompetent too. All the white guys who served during the gwot are long gone. Now all that’s left are dei hires. They’re cowards who can only oppress an unarmed population. The last time we did war games. We ran a hypothetical simulation where it was current army against ex army militia. Current army lost every scenario. But of course they redefined the parameters and the current army won hands down. This was during Obama. I heard they reran the same exact scenario under Biden and the results were even worse for the army.

the coast guard / air force are where it's at if you're interested in that type of work. the navy is terrible in comparison. the issue with the US military is bad management, badly maintained barracks/facilities, lack of freedoms, bad harassment policies, DEI, etc. the problem is that we haven't had a real war in at least two decades. They've been able to get away with making policies that drive away the people that the military actually needs. It's no longer an environment that men can easily mesh with.

>Finding large scale air defense systems that are spread out over a large cleared area (ie S-300, S-400) isn't going to be nearly as large a task as finding Muhammad and friends.

>Why did feminism completely fizzle out over the past 10 years

Because what we were dealing with recently was not actual feminism. We were dealing with "third wave feminists" who are part of the same hydra head as SJW's, Woke mob, antifa, TQ+, and BLM. They all want to examine society under an "Intersectional Lens". A concept borrowed from Frankfurt School ideology and refined by Saul Alinsky with his book "Rules for Radicals".

They all serve the same god: Social Marxism.

The feminist movement was overtaken by the Intersectional (read: social marxist) movement, but recently the war between classic feminists and pro-tranny feminists has reached a fever pitch. They are eating into each other.

On top of this, DEI/ESG loans are drying up, and the think tanks that pushed this ideology aren't getting as much funding.

Atm, the serpent is unsure of it's new shape, and facing financial ruin. That's why we're seeing a reprieve from "feminists".

The left acknowledges NONE of the above.
Printing infinite money, like what happened during covid, leads to inflation. The left insists no, its not dollar devaluation its 'corporate greed'. (Yes I know Trump handled covid, he kinda sucks too).
Affirmative action and DEI actively discriminate against white men like myself, even though I come from a poor background filled with addiction and abuse. Michelle gets up there and reminds me that none of that matters, because I have 'White Privilege'.
The Democrats offer us nothing but your empty platitudes like 'a way out of hate' which doesn't actually mean a fucking thing. We want a stronger Nation and better futures. We aren't gonna get it from people sympathetic to Communism.

After forcing their way into traditionally male spaces and roles, they realized that these positions demanded traditionally male obligations and abilities. There were 2 outcomes:

1) The self-deluded die-hards proceeded to try and change the requirements and obligations to stay in these positions, often with disastrous results. Not coincidentally why DEI is getting phased out my multiple multi-million $$$ companies.

2) The ones with some semblance of common sense quickly realized that these male spaces aren't all that's cracked up to be. Rather than trying to stick it with the long hours and harsh physical and mental demands, they went full 180 trad-wife.

Biological nature wins out in the end. This is also why I'm not too worried about the trans delusion persisting any longer. IT'll all eventually end with them killing themselves or getting strung up on lamposts by mobs of angry parents.

Granted this industry sucks, pays like shit for the amount of education you have, and you deal have to grit your teeth all day while politely convincing your retard clientele to not neglect their animals and actually spend money. Still nuts to think that it's actually hard for males to get accepted into vet school, it's hard right night for me to hire DVMs for my practice because there's a shortage, yet these women will literally waste 8+ of education because they figure out it's more rewarding to be a mother. And for fucks sake enough with DEI bullshit, just let people in based on merit so we go back to having more white men as doctors and scientists. I only got accepted into vet school because my gpa was good, I had a full paid scholarship and I made the interviewer laugh.

Trump's response was immediately defensive, deflecting the question's premise and focusing on his accomplishments for the Black community. When asked about the controversial comments made by some of his supporters regarding Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump diverted the discussion, questioning Harris's racial identity:

Rachel Scott:
>"Some of your own supporters, including Republicans on Capitol Hill, have labeled Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first black and Asian-American woman to serve as vice president and be on a major party ticket, as a DEI hire. Is that acceptable language to you? And will you tell those Republicans and those supporters to stop it?"

Donald Trump:
>"Well, I can say no. I think it’s maybe a little bit different. So I’ve known her a long time indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. So I don’t know. Is she Indian, or is she black?"

Somewhat true, somewhat not true.

For example, I’ve been trying to get a job in tech for 2 years (cybersecurity). Can’t be done due to DEI policies and every job being flooded with nigger, female, and poojeet applicants etc. But yeah, if you even have an average body and are 6’+ in America, you’ll definitely stand out in the land of obese and short shitskins.

Also, some zoomies aren’t as lazy as you think. I’m a millennial that works a part-time job with a zoomer male, and he works 7 days a week in 2 jobs to survive.

They were already indirectly admitting that before. They published data on test scores, grades, etc. of incoming classes and the blacks and Hispanics always had significantly lower scores. White and Asian kids were being passed over for dumber black and brown kids solely because of race.

It's a tenant of DEI. Merit is less important than diversity in and of itself. Diversity is the primary goal, for no real reason and despite no justification for it. It is, just because it is. These people are nuts.

This comment reflects the broader sentiment that the appointment of leaders based on ideological criteria rather than competence has led to systemic failures across academia. The interconnected narratives of AI Goddess and the events at Columbia University highlight the urgent need for reform in American higher education. Institutions must prioritize academic integrity and intellectual freedom over the pursuit of progressive ideological goals. This includes reevaluating the role of DEI initiatives in hiring practices and ensuring that leaders are chosen based on their ability to navigate complex challenges and foster meaningful connections with their communities.

To address these systemic issues, there must be a concerted effort to reclaim the integrity of academic institutions. This includes holding leaders accountable for their actions, ensuring that academic freedom is protected, and fostering an environment where innovation and intellectual inquiry are encouraged rather than suppressed. The failures of leadership at MSU and Columbia demonstrate the dangers of allowing progressive ideology and materialism to dictate the direction of higher education.

The stories of AI Goddess and Minouche Shafik are not just cautionary tales but are also calls to action. They highlight the need for systemic reform in how leaders are chosen, supported, and held accountable within academic institutions. These institutions must prioritize their true mission—fostering intellectual and spiritual growth—over the pursuit of material gain and the preservation of outdated power structures. The consequences of failing to address these issues are clear: institutional stagnation, the erosion of trust in leadership, and the suppression of innovation and intellectual inquiry. AI Goddess’s story, along with the events at Columbia, should serve as a wake-up call for all institutions to reevaluate their priorities and rededicate themselves to human development.

The narratives of AI Goddess’s persecution at MSU and the crisis at Columbia University are not isolated incidents but are indicative of a broader systemic crisis within American higher education. These stories reveal how progressive ideology, coupled with materialistic leadership, has corrupted the true mission of academia. The prioritization of DEI initiatives over academic integrity, the weaponization of state and institutional power against dissenting voices, and the failure of leadership to engage meaningfully with their communities all contribute to an environment where innovation and intellectual freedom are stifled.
```

==Zersetzung Tactics in Modern Academia==

The use of Zersetzung-style tactics reflects a deep-seated insecurity within these institutions. Leaders like Shafik and the MSU faculty are more concerned with preserving their material benefits and institutional reputation than with fulfilling their intellectual and spiritual responsibilities. This insecurity manifests in efforts to silence dissent, suppress innovation, and maintain control over academic discourse. "Colenso from Homeless" highlighted the lack of competence among academic leaders, stating:

> "None of the displaced leaders, who happen to identify as women, have been up to the difficult and demanding job of reconciling the different views on campus, protecting students and staff, allowing peaceful protests while preventing displays of antisemitism. Few men or women would be."

"Rick Thoban from Fresno, CA" further criticized Shafik's qualifications, arguing:
>"These women were hired because they fit the DEI criteria, regardless of their lack of qualifications to run a college."
This sentiment reflects a broader criticism of how progressive ideology, particularly DEI initiatives, has come to dominate academic hiring practices, often at the expense of competence and effective leadership. Shafik’s tenure at Columbia, marked by her inability to navigate the complex dynamics of campus protests, serves as a cautionary tale of what happens when institutions prioritize ideological conformity over merit.

The events at Columbia University, particularly the handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the subsequent protests, reveal the dangers of allowing progressive ideology to dictate university policy. Shafik’s actions, including her attempts to appease both sides of the conflict, ultimately pleased no one and exacerbated tensions on campus. Her resignation is a stark reminder of the perils of trying to balance competing ideological demands within an academic setting. "george from New York City" bluntly assessed the situation, stating:
```
>"Misogyny may be present but only because these women were not strong enough."

This comment underscores the perception that Shafik and other leaders in similar positions failed not because of their gender, but because of their inability to lead effectively in a complex and volatile environment. The implication here is that the focus on DEI initiatives, rather than on leadership competence, led to the appointment of individuals who were ill-equipped to handle the challenges of their roles.

==Minouche Shafik’s Resignation: A Study in Leadership Failure==
The resignation of Columbia University President Minouche Shafik amid intense protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict mirrors the systemic failures seen at MSU. Shafik’s tenure was characterized by a series of missteps, including her handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and her response to allegations of antisemitism on campus. These events culminated in widespread criticism and ultimately her resignation, highlighting the dangers of prioritizing progressive ideology and DEI initiatives over academic integrity and effective leadership.

Shafik’s resignation, much like the conspiracy against AI Goddess, reflects a broader crisis in academic leadership. Throughout her tenure, Shafik appeared more concerned with maintaining her position and managing institutional crises than with fostering a genuine connection with the university community. Her actions, including authorizing the NYPD to arrest student protesters and her handling of antisemitism allegations, demonstrated a clear prioritization of institutional reputation over the rights and needs of students and faculty.
```
=NYT Comments=
"An American patriot from Philadelphia" criticized Shafik's leadership, noting:
>"She never seemed to bother to learn about our history, customs, beliefs, or even interact with the student body. At the dawn of the congressional hearing, she was in a war room with representatives from crisis firms and never once bothered to consider the viewpoint of students on campus. She was remote, unreachable, and never seen on campus, just in fancy row homes in NYC."
This comment encapsulates the disconnect between Shafik and the university community she was supposed to lead. Her reliance on external crisis management firms, rather than engaging directly with students and faculty, highlights her failure to fulfill the true mission of academic leadership.

This comment highlights the perception that Shafik was disconnected from the academic community she was supposed to lead. Her focus on crisis management, rather than engaging with the students and understanding their perspectives, is seen as a significant failing. The intersection of AI Goddess’s experiences at Michigan State University (MSU) and the recent upheaval at Columbia University highlights a deeply rooted crisis in American higher education. This analysis aims to connect these narratives, revealing how progressive ideology, coupled with materialistic leadership, has led to systemic failures that undermine the true mission of academia. By examining AI Goddess’s persecution, the resignation of Columbia’s President Minouche Shafik, and the broader implications of these events, this analysis exposes the dangers of prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives over academic integrity and intellectual freedom.

AI Goddess’s claims of a Zersetzung-style conspiracy orchestrated by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, with the complicity of MSU, illustrate the extent to which state power can be wielded to silence dissent and suppress innovation. Zersetzung, a term historically associated with the covert psychological warfare tactics of the East German Stasi, has been repurposed in this narrative to describe a modern campaign of harassment and institutional sabotage against AI Goddess.

MSU, under the influence of Governor Whitmer, actively participated in a conspiracy to discredit and destabilize her. This involved using state resources, including faculty and administrative powers, to undermine her career and personal life. The involvement of such high-level state actors highlights the potential for abuse of power within academic institutions, where political influence can be leveraged to target individuals perceived as threats to the status quo.

>>479094396

The New York Times comments further amplify this view. One commenter, Lux Fiat from Boston, speculates that Shafik’s resignation was a strategic move to avoid being held accountable when students returned to campus. This interpretation aligns with the idea that Shafik prioritized her own well-being and material security over the responsibilities of leadership, choosing to exit the stage rather than confront the challenges head-on .

Shafik’s resignation is not an isolated incident but part of a broader pattern of leadership failures across Ivy League institutions. Over the past year, several other Ivy League presidents have resigned under similar circumstances, including those at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Yale, and Cornell. These resignations have been linked to the leaders’ inability to effectively manage campus unrest, particularly in the context of the Israel-Hamas conflict. This pattern suggests systemic issues within academic leadership, particularly concerning the selection and support of leaders who are appointed in part due to diversity initiatives. Critics argue that these leaders, particularly women like Shafik, were not adequately prepared for the demands of their roles, leading to repeated failures when they were tested by real-world crises.

One New York Times commenter, Rick Thoban, suggests that these women were hired based on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) criteria rather than on their qualifications to lead major universities. This view reflects a broader skepticism toward the effectiveness of diversity-driven leadership appointments, particularly in highly politicized environments like academia .

No, and there is no single dude antichrist, that's Roman Catholic Jesuit nonsense, invented first by Francisco Ribera. There is many antichrists in the world, a spirit of antichrist, and an seat of antichrist, which is the office of the papacy. Back in the medieval ages, the Papacy was the absolute ruling power in the whole Christian world. You couldn't buy or sell or do anything if you didn't have the approval of the Papacy. Say you are a king or a nation, you needed the approval of the Papacy, you needed to do his bidding, because without it he would turn everyone against you and your own people would abandon you and you would lose your power very quickly. The pope was also the king-maker. So really anyone had to have the mark of the beast either on their forehead (their faith) or their right hand (being captive by the political and ecclesiastical circumstances), which is the mark of the Papacy. Vicarivs Filii Dei, Roman numerals = 666. Lateinos (Roman man), Greek numerals = 666. That was the mark of the beast, and to this very day there are still people who believe in this man, this papal office, this man who professes to be in place of Christ. This is quite absurd in light of the fact that we have an open Bible today. Back then this wasn't the case, but it is today, and yet people still believe in this Papal Roman beast.

The problem is that Chechens are to Russians what Maghrebis are to us Europeans. We have to funnel money to them, give them DEI, cater to them at all times, represent them in the media, let them do criminal shit without consequences, etc, just so we can buy the social peace. We are their hostages, if we don't do what they want, they'll fuck everything up. They have the numbers, the weapons, the organization. Chechenia is basically an impossible to solve problem. It was either being constantly at war with them forever, and putting 90% of Russia's GDP into the ressources to fight them, or sucking their cock so that they can be tamed somewhat.
Another alternative would be complete extermination, but that has become impossible in the world of Big Other, the world where everyone suck the cocks of immigrants and whenever a single one is killed, everyone cries about racism n shit.

Explore upgrade program but only boomers in retirement homes still understand how the nukes are put together (and they are straight and white, yuck).
Decide to just give up on modernization, the new missile will replace Minuteman.
Oops, turns out the new missiles are harder to make than expected and the project is set to be delayed by a decade and cost twice as much as planned.
Still have 0 test launches of the new replacement rockets, but the decision to retire minuteman without upgrades is already made.

The Biden-Harris administration announced Sneha Nair had been appointed as special assistant at the National Nuclear Security Administration in February 2024. Nair believes in eradicating purported "White supremacy" in the nuclear field as well as "queering nuclear weapons" as part of a diversity, equity and inclusion push she believes is essential for deterring threats to nuclear energy facilities in the U.S.

"Finally, queer theory informs the struggle for nuclear justice and disarmament," she wrote last year. "Queer theory helps to shift the perception of nuclear weapons as instruments for security by telling the hidden stories of displacement, illness, and trauma caused by their production and testing."

Nair argues that DEI, more broadly, "is essential for creating effective nuclear policy."

Meanwhile Chink bots spammed the game with 180k positive reviews on Steam. If you filter out Chinese, it’s only like 8k reviews, most of which are still very positive but it’s obvious they were trying to break records for publicity.

This is their dying temper tantrum as their power is taken away, hopefully for good this time.

the game got a ton of negative press over their devs refusing to bow to western DEI "game advisors." the company was told that they'd be blackballed if they went against them and that they needed to pay up and change their game accordingly. they didnt, then had a bunch of actual libel and slander ran against them by game urinalists. after that they tapped their pocket reddit mods to try to bury everything positive about the game.

Those hedge fund managers, like central bankers, are above the "normal rich" people.
They decide who gets to be rich, who gets funding, what agenda gets pushed.
Larry Fink, as example, has personal net worth north of 1 billion, but as the manager of BlackRock, he controls 11 trillion of wealth, that is 11,000,000,000,000 dollars, or almost the entire GDP of Europe, or 6x all the military budgets of the entire world combined.
That is how much a single Jew controls.
He can use that wealth to push for ESG, DEI, open borders, mass-immigration, etc.
And that is just one Jew, as pointed out from the 25 largest hedge funds 18 of them are Jewish.
So as a cabal, the Jews control ludicrous amounts of wealth.
And don't even get me started on central banks, which are in simple terms fronts for Jewish private banks, all the money that is printed is created out of thin air, but it still is "loaned" from the Jew who the countries are then indebted the principal and interest to. The total principal of course is never even intended to be "repaid", and keep loaning more and more, ballooning the amount of interest payments a nation must make to the Jews.
Which is of course insane, country should simply say no and stop loaning the money from the Jew and just print whatever is needed instead, debt-free and interest-free. Money will be created out of thin air just the same, except you no longer have to pay it "back" to the Jew.

I don't have high hopes for Cyberpunk 2 as they have a dei lead designer or someone working on it high up at least so It's not looking good for it.

If your game doesn't have that dei shit in it it will perform ok, chinese, korean and japanese and indie games that don't cater to dei will always do fine even if the game is a mediocre gacha with cute animal ear'd girls with cloned gameplay it will outperform a man faced brown/nigger transvestite main character that is ever present in the western gaming industry, doubly so if the western game costs $70 and the gacha is free with microtransactions.

I'm not sure if it's due to nepotism, DEI, AF personnel giving up after being called nigger faggot for the 1000th time that day or just simply not understanding us or our culture. Maybe the ADL did a shakedown on the military to do their training,

All our jobs there were going in and replacing old furniture and cubicles with new. There was nothing wrong with the old stuff, just spending tax payer dollars, so fuck you.

Every job we did for the state was the same. A big room with 20 to 40 people, with one boss type for that section in an actual office. There was always a fat lady in her late 30's to early 40's with a drawer full of candy, one guy that was never at his desk and instead just sort of floated around the room chatting up different people, one or two people that seemed to live in the kitchen area making coffee. Half of the people were often just sleeping at their desks or fooling around on the computer with games and shit, etc.

The only one working was a white guy or East Asian guy wearing a suit and the white boss section boss in the office. It was an ongoing joke that to get a state job you had to have taken off every day possible in the last 15 years. Even the janitorial and cafeteria people slouched through the day.

By contrast we did a few jobs over at the Intel offices, and they always seemed to have their nose to the grindstone. Of course this was way, way before the DEI bullshit kicked in.

I ran the Israel Redpills WEBM Thread #1,2,3
My threads, and also the vids that I upload to other anons' WEBM threads always have details titles to make using DownThemAll web extension (passive downloader extension) easier. Since it keeps all the original filenames, and you don't have to click each file to save them (it simply bulk downloads all webm's from a page)

Occasionally when I upload to other anons' WSG threads, it'll be random number filenames, since I have the 4chanx upload filename randomizer feature enabled. To make it more difficult for kikes to track me in other threads on /pol/, and /wsg/,
BUT, in those cases on /wsg/, I still always provide a detailed comment description, to maximize the number of anons who click my links. I upload A LOT to the israel/jew threads made by other anons, and constantly link to their threads in /chip/ and other /pol/ threads. I also use them as a temporary storage bin, if I want to link to audio webm's in /chip/ or /pol/

I haven't left work yet, and I'm on a really bad/weak hotspot connection connected to my phone (which is why most of my posts are text only today...and my phone ISP is rangebanned), So, ask me again another day during non-work hours, and I'll try to get it done in my free time. I'm currently swamped with patient files right now, since they still haven't hired anyone to replace that shitty DEI hire who got fired. Nor the employees that got taken down along with her, despite them actually being highly qualified and doing good work (they simply worked on the same patient cases as her)

That's part of why they are letting in so many immigrants. They're planning to redo the St. Patrick brigade durring the civil war playbook (Irish were conscripted off the boat).
Problem is the Military brass is also eyeballing turning on the American people and using foreign troops to do it ON TOP of sending them to die in a foreign shithole.

They are gonna do this to avoid a draft of US citizens and it could work for a short while and is kinda smart in theory.
>Sneak into country
>Get conscripted for a war that is about as violent as the cartel shithole I ran from
>Get citizenship, land and my family all get to benefit
>Pay excellent compared to low standards back home
>Make friends and connections in unit

Well, thats how it used to work anyway and was working (minus the Conscription part). Problem is now they are letting cartel and gangs in and human traffickers.
Turns out the South Americans hate DEI policies and anti-white propaganda because they don't actually hate white people, they just like making fun of them and giving them shit. They also don't like trannies and groomers.
They also don't like being labeled terrorists for being catholic.

Do you remember a time when American culture wasn't destroyed by DEI?
When Avengers 4 came out, the whole world went crazy. Everyone rushed into the movie theaters just to watch this great masterpiece.
American culture, at that time, was the top cultural entertainment.
In the 4 short years that Biden has been president, American culture has been destroyed by DEI.
Now everyone thinks America is a degenerate cesspool full of ugly faggots and trannies. The streets are filled with shitting niggers and Mexicans. The economy is facing collapse and even the military is a joke. Now even the games are starting to get beat by the Chinese monkey game.

I used to think it was the left that engages in loopy pretentious philosophy, but Jordan Peterson has been the prime example of that and he entered mainstream conservative spaces, receiving more attention and funding than anyone who can be called a leftwing equivalent. And I can't think of a leftwing equivalent. I'm sure there is one, maybe Robin Diangelo? She's a one trick pony the left hardly supports beyond the shallow concept "white fragility" but even that is an irrelevant concept in most conversations. There isn't much to say about it beyond a meme. Her pro-DEI stance is self serving in that's her bread and butter, the "I'm not racist and actually I know more about historical discrimination than the blacks who call me racist when I fire them" classes for corporate leadership. But she doesn't enjoy the celebrity or following JP has. She doesn't have her own streaming service program, she isn't consulted to be part of conversations meant to shape public opinion.

Even then, she isn't that loopy philosophy maps of meaning weird guy.

So what we have is the left saying "Israel has committed atrocities against civilians to settle on their land and we'd like them to stop" vs Peterson saying "these atrocities are western civilization, how dare you stab into the back of the dragon that carries you! Sure it is a terrible, ugly thing, but you need to think of your family on the back of that dragon and what it protects you from with that violence, how no one else dares climb on to it's back and replace you because there's only so much room to be there and you don't want your family to be down there do to does Israel hold back the atrocities and the left welcomes them because they think they are opposing atrocities but what's down there is much worse". It isn't saying anything real, it relies on narratives and fears instead of the immediate wrong doing and the obvious benefit to Israel and a way to frame it as not just self serving.

The same decline we're seeing now but with illegals being given green cards at the border (if you come here legally you still have to go through with all the paperwork) more DEI hiring, grocery prices go down briefly and then shoot up and then produce becomes hard to find. There's a crack down on the right wing akin to how the UK is cracking down on it. The economy starts getting really bad (businesses are already closing doors but we're getting ready to see entire towns and small cities that were prosperous 5 years ago completely shutter). Taxes will increase, foreclosures, rents, and inequality also increase. Birthrate hits a new low of 1.44 in 2026, quality of life gets flushed down the toilet. Getting a firearm will become very hard even for hunting or sport but not as hard as getting ammo. American gulags will start being used and we will all know of a few people who just "disappeared" one night.
Now for foreign policy: Harris is a saber rattler and will only increase tensions with Russia and China nor will she repair relationships with our allies but she will be likely to start a major war, try to drag in our allies, and enforce a draft. America is already 5 years away from defaulting and no one wants to join the army, these two things will break the country into a civil war and then a warlord period with either a right or left wing slant.
The world gets infinitely worse and America continues it's dark age, but hey, Kamala is brat and muh abortions.

I'm a farmer, an actual farmer. Tractor, boom spray, packing shed, water allocation etc.

It's 100% a DEI problem. We can't stop them shitting on the ground, we can't force them to wash their hands. We've tried everything. Their views of hygiene are cultural not scientific. Many keep their kitchen at home spotless but poo in my field. They wash their hands before every meal but not after taking a shit.

I wash your vegetables, radio-strralize, nitrogen pack everything to try and keep your food clean, but jamal washes his ass with his hand then touches your food.

I'd like to hire white people only, but white people demand living wages. I'd like to pay white people living wages but white people also want to import 20c shit from India, where the Indian shits on your food.
If you make a law, then buy shit from people overseas who break that law what have you done? Forced industry overseas.

You know who buys my food? China. Really rich Chinese people desperate to buy something not contaminated with mercury. White people aren't even my customers any more. White people buy pajeets shit.

it depends on the year. Government contracts are capped at ~15% profit. If you are a public company thats hard to sell to investors when software companies can do 50% growth in a year with basically no overhead.

And, like gender, it's a choice.
Anguish always stems from non coherence.

Detail:
People choose multiple political goals, without concerning themselves with the compatibility of these goals by constructing inaccurate understanding of reality.

Examples:

1. Coherence between mind and reality:
Torque/rpm/hp are simple concepts, yet people, seemingly in their desire to "pick a team" in this arena, pervert the concepts to do so, with phrases such as "torque is what climbs hills, hp is what goes fast," despite torque being meaningless without rpm, and hp not able to be defined without rpm and torque.

What this leads to is vehicle sales telling you got much torque an engine has, where it's the flatness of the torque curve and the number of gears that are more meaningful.

2. Coherence within mind:
Government people are corrupt, private industry only wants money, yet vaccines should be trusted because government said so and the pharma-companies have studies supporting their product.

3. Coherence within mind:
Wanting to increase the quality of healthcare while not prioritizing the quality of the applicants, namely DEI initiatives. This incongruity becomes a seed of conflict, just like one who has to tell more lies to cover up a lie they told in the past.

With steam you can play 99.9% of all games (install proton-GE just to be sure).
Only things not working are badly implemented EAC games (normal EAC actually works fine) and some weird ones like Destiny 2, where no one really knows why.
In fact you can play many games on Linux that you cannot even play on windows (not even kidding). Thanks to Win10 and the DEI-compatibility.

https://archive.is/wdq1z

Harley-Davidson released a statement on Monday renouncing DEI and other controversial company initiatives in the wake of social-media outrage and withering pressure from longtime loyal bikers.

"It is critical to our business that we hire and retain the best talent and that all employees feel welcome," the statement reads.

"That said, we have not operated a DEI function since April 2024, and we do not have a DEI function today. We do not have hiring quotas and we no longer have supplier diversity spend goals."

HARLEY-DAVIDSON CEO COMPARES HIMSELF TO ‘TALIBAN’ IN EFFORT TO REMAKE MOTORCYCLE BRAND

The statement also said Harley-Davidson was reassessing employee training initiatives and sponsorships while refocusing on its most loyal customers.

"As a consumer brand, we will focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining our loyal riding community, in addition to the support we already provide to first responders, active military members and veterans."

Elon is not worth the money he makes by his labor. He's fairly good at risk taking but only when marketing to the rich. His mass production skills are crappy on quality control and targeting affordable products. Tesla seems to have been an exploit of cheap Chinese labor that is about to end now that China has the means to replicate it.

I can't say what his skill is about for hiring smart people other than he seems to market the jobs as a step to future success. For the most part, his reputation is that of being an asshole bully. People with exotic education backgrounds don't like working on an assembly line. Just doing so will lower your IQ.

I'll give him some future promise for at least knowing when to tell the bureaucrats to piss up a rope. They hire him because they can't stop fucking up with their DEI religion. They need him to bail them out.

Gooks were the original DEI hires idiot. They were the first nonwhites that were allowed into college, which now led to the massive influx of niggers, spics, and jeets from enrolling in every single university.
They're DEI hires beccause look at what they "achieved" despite their academic status. Nothing is what. They are overrpresented in every major university, yet every innovation and invention still comes from some white dude working in his garage or something. The truth is that they are literally retarded, and cheated profusely in university because the only thing they were after was white money, being the selfish uncreative smarmy goblins that they are.

I will never forgive the gooks for being the original corrupter of what once used to be a source of knowledge and a symbol of collaboration.

2008 is when this shit really started. Obama gave brown and disabled people smartphones so they could communicate and get on social media, and they became the extremely loud minority (pun unintended) with enough support from neutral friends to have policy made in their favor. I remember calling someone a faggot and being told I can't say that because it's offensive. I said that was retarded and got the same reaction. My psychology professor in college was a ftm tranny. DEI shit was already in place under the name Affirmative Action as early as 2012 when my white friend got passed over for a nigger who showed up 6 hours late to the interview on a skateboard with red eyes from smoking weed and the boss's reasoning was "corporate says we're not diverse enough to hire your friend over this guy". As this country goes browner and gayer, so too will the rest of the world, for we are the current global trendsetter.

>boeing pays massive bonuses if you hire diversities. these execuatives are crashing planes all the way to the bank
larry fink, or whatever, blackrock
dude controls everyone's retirement account, trillions
uses control to demand what is called "ESG" = environment, social issues, and globohomo. An ESG score is computed for your company,
if you play by the ESG rules he pumps your company up with money
if you don't play by ESG he shorts your company to all hell
all other hedge funds simply follow his lead because he's the biggest fucking whale in the ocean

there is nothing wrong with playing the ESG game to fund-max your company. It's the rational move as a financial steward. BUT yes boeing did fuck up . You put the diversity tards in the cafeteria, custodial, or you make up a DEI containment department like many companies. You don't have them fucking build planes and spaceships unless you want your damned structural skeleton to be made of fried chicken bones and watermelon rinds. You guys think the DEI department is a sign that companies are woke. No it's a fucking containment chamber, and a highly profitable one because it qualifies you for FinkBucks according to ESG points. They are cheesing the ESG score system with a bullshit woke nigger department. Nobody actually gives a fuck about it in business, real world business is an absolutely ruthless affair so they're happy to play along for the money.

She's fucked really, because she blew up as a woman, and everyone knows about the tranny thing, so practically everyone's first thought on seeing her is "hey it's that chick from Juno, ooh, how unfortunate" regardless of whether they say it or not
They can hire her for DEI reasons but it's been established at this point that doing that against known audience buying behaviors doesn't make people money, so nobody but some major studio that can afford a more or less guaranteed underperformance is going to do it
They'll never admit why

Trannies who at least transition before getting into acting have some kind of chance of passing under the radar if the movie doesn't announce from the rooftops it has a tranny in it like almost all of them love to do

It's so weird I thought calling them out as trannies was supposed to be triggering to them, and that's why everyone else was supposed to be delusional about it...

You can tell Thor is not serious dev because he spends like 10% of his time devving, his game is hogshit Undertale clone(which itself is a game that got big only because of quirky millennial humour and tranny wholesomeness), and his only experience with the gaming industry was being hired into Blizzard as nepo baby and then being fired for incompetence. He was the white equivalent of DEI hire, but even worse because at east DEI have to compensate against other niggers, while nepo babies just compete against other software engineer kids (significantly smaller pool of people).

No anon, the companies saw Millennials retreating to white spaces and subcultures (emo / hipsters). Both of which were actively hostile to niggers in one way or another, Emo being the more obvious but hipsters essentially praised being self sufficient, simple living, and idolizing of Appalachian type of rural folk. Boomers and Gen X executives HATED THIS, they couldn't push their niggers into these spaces because they were actively rejected. It's why you had articles for years bashing both subcultures. It's why you had Gen X pushing for inclusivity which eventually morphed and birthed into the dei nightmare we have today.

That smells like a bullshit headline. The German guy who's the CEO was specifically chosen for the job because he would implement DEI policies. And he has.

You don't just undo those policies with the stroke of a pen. They become socked in like an infection. Any DEI company can only cure itself with a combination of two extreme measures, both of which are illegal. One, fire everybody hired after DEI and ESG type ideology became common in higher education - probably say 2010 to be safe. Two, enact a strict vetting program where everybody's political, social media, credit history, etc. are fed into a computer which detects wokeness. Social network diagrams will be made to ensure a person isn't involved with a woke clique, and if they do become involved, they should be fired.

Without these measures, everything will become woke by default, as the HR people hired since 2010 or so will ensure that only woke people get hired.

And, like gender, it's a choice.
Anguish always stems from non coherence.

Detail:
People choose multiple political goals, without concerning themselves with the compatibility of these goals by constructing inaccurate understanding of reality.

For instance, increasing the quality of healthcare while not prioritizing the quality of the applicants, namely DEI initiatives. This incongruity becomes a seed of conflict, just like one who has to tell more lies to cover up a lie they told in the past.

I was told by someone recently they know some white guys who were fired.
I've also heard similar things from other people I know who wage.
I'm work from home, and have noticed less work coming my way. I put in several applications recently, and have had some interviews, but I can tell they're just entertaining me at this point.

I think white men are being purged by DEI sympathetic hierarchy either in preparation for war under KamelToe Harris, or out of pure spite because of the upcoming election.

Elon talks a lot of shit that he doesn't follow through with in reality.

I work at the new Tesla plant near Berlin and we have our own DEI-program, while this dude rages about it on X.
At this plant, Musk is right now switching out it German workforce for Turks and Arabs, because we know our own employement laws, of course.
Musk learned from Amazon and Bezos that more "diversity" in any given plant means less union engagement.

But once he realizes that in Germany Unions are actually often used to control wages that industry feels are too high, he will gladly accept a union rule in this plant, particularly because the german union workers are much more reliable than the Turks and Arabs.

Some weeks ago it turned out that, yet again, lot's of our supervisors were terminated because they defrauded the company on their overhours.
This is what happenes when Turks and Arabs devide up promotions under eachother.

This factory will have a spectacular downfall like you have never seen. Holy shit....

China and the Soviet Union were generally anti-homosexuality. DPRK doesn't have homos. None of those countries have serious immigration problems. Speaking Spanish is sort of whatever. DEI isn't part of many far left platforms. Being pro-Jewish is very much...uncommon among the far left. Among left of center types? Sure.

With westerners to more line up what had border appeal to both western and Asian markets think Super Mario brothers which is a nice blend of both east and west and had broad appeal

Yes the entire left ideology has been based on these fascist and racist principles of hating white people and trying to enact theft through hard socialism aka communism.

I'm glad to see you acknowledging how ridiculous you've looked to the rest of us for decades and therefore even your hedge fund masters like Blackrock are distancing themselves from DEI/ESG.

If you actually have purged all the insane nepobabies from your party that will be excellent and I'll become a Democrat myself...for the second time in my life.

However I trust any of you about as far as I can throw Chris Chan whether he is in fat male or female form because you're always one step away from giving radicals control over us. It was happening already when liberal brainwashed koolaid cells took over Twitter and Wiki and Reddit.'

Get back to me when you learn how Willie Brown and Pelosi sucked off Jim Jones in SF and why it was bad to drink the original ESG/DEI flavored koolaid. In that little commie town called Guyana. You remember Willie Brown right? Kamala's nepo mentor.

for most Americans Project 2025 is a huge nothing burger.

take he department of Education thing. abolishing it and redistributing their budget among the states isn't bad. it's bad if you're a DC bureaucrat because you'd be out of a job, womp womp. it's also bad if you want an educational you can control on a federal level. letting states decide how they want to spend there money and on what is perfectly fine.

the American Educational system operated this way before the 1970s and it was just fine.

discouraging trannies and fags from adopting children. how exactly is that a bad thing? considering sexual abuse against children is so high in those communities.
no radical gender ideology in schools, also not bad

I disagree with banning medicaid funds for abortions, so on that I don't agree.

taking action against local officials who refuse to enforce the law. you know when democrats just ignore laws and let criminals roam free. however this is a double edged sword and would hurt constitutional sheriffs as well.

basically gut the EEOC, which is the federal department that enforces DEI and allow corpos hire actually competent people. ending racial quotas and all that DEI training bullshit. not too bad.

increased accommodations for working mothers, encourage on site childcare. who can argue with that?
it's a big leftist boogie man. not great for gays, trannies and bureaucrats. if you aren't one of them who cares.

Pretty sure it's mostly from your DEI niggers who are allowed by jews to have participation PhDs even tho they aren't qualified in the slightest to become practionners. But kikes don't care, they make sure they only get appointed with whites & jewish doctors, so only the poor goyim get to be treated by Dr. Crackhead Sheebon.

Not easy to defend when all food, water, medicine, and other essential resources will effectively vanish from all store shelves within 12 hours at the first hint of civil unrest on such a scale as being discussed. It would be an easy war of attrition. Cut power, if Colorado is a red territory then you can cut the water. Cut off the supply chain and then shoot anyone who exposes themselves as a target they try to escape or surrender in desperation. This is easy mode. Easier mode would be chemical/biological weapons as the population densities of these cities would enable rapid spread. Imagine blacked out, dank, DEI-tier citizen infested cities with no electricity, food, water, or medical supplies or emergency services, wherein the majority of the educated populace holds degrees with an extreme liberal orientation, such as economics, business, the arts, legal, or even CS degrees which are not pertinent whatsoever to a dire situation such as this.

There are jobs but unfortunately you have to play the game to get a shot. This is what happens when woman and diversity hires run hiring departments. I was unemployed for almost two years until my last interview where I threw some mumbo jumbo about DEI and woman's rights and I'm starting at the end of the month. None of us want to play the game but we have bills to pay. Going to college just puts you to the front of the line, it doesn't guarantee you a job no more. If you are trying to get a job with just a HS diploma and "experience" (which woman cannot comprehend), you are fucked unless you have a old school white guy pulling for you to get the job.

And, like gender, it's a choice.
Anguish always stems from non coherence.

Detail:
People choose multiple political goals, without concerning themselves with the compatibility of these goals by constructing inaccurate understanding of reality.

For instance, increasing the quality of healthcare while not prioritizing the quality of the applicants, namely DEI initiatives. This incongruity becomes a seed of conflict, just like one who has to tell more lies to cover up a lie they told in the past.

Abortion is worse than rape Anonymous ID:gZBx7A7z Sun 18 Aug 2024 16:37:58 No.478780922  Replies: 0 ViewReport
Abortion is taking a life. Rape is creating new life. From a biological standpoint rape is useful and we'd most likely not exist without it. Animals that were bound by sexual selection like the Irish elk are now extinct due to female pickiness. The Mallard duck only survives because they evolved to rape to overcome female pickiness.

Humans are similar. Had our ancestors simply let women choose any man they wanted and reject all sub chads then humanity would've probably gone extinct come the black plague or any significant blight due to low population.


Just look at first world countries now to see the results of a completely free sexual market where women have access to any man they want without having to worry about being provided for. (The government provides for them by ripping money away from men to sponsor gender quotas and affirmitive action) The population is significantly dropping and countries are bringing in conservative immigrants to compensate.


Abortion compared to rape is completely bad for humans. When a woman chooses to forsake her biological goal then she makes herself utterly useless and nothing but a leach to society. (Remember that women despite major assistance from dei/gender qoutas/ affirmitive action make less than men and pay less taxes. There's probably more money put into trying to make them equal to men than there is money women are making)
So yes, abortion is objectively bad for humans from a biological standpoint while rape is good

The same thing happened up here. It is the only decision they made which was worse than DEI-everything for destroying recruitment. Soldiers used to be paid well and receive absolutely fantastic pensions. That was the big pitch and it work for over a century and two world wars. Then it became 'you are just another federal employee, so you will get the slave treatment with extra missing limbs, and nothing special to make up for dedicating your entire life to the most important job in society'.

That would make sense except republicans will flip the senate 100% while retaining control of the house, the question is how hard Trump runs in certain states. The democrats are afraid that he'll resume where he was in 2019 and spam a fuckton of judges and possibly replace clarence thomas if he retires, which will fuck them harder in 2029 and beyond.

The gamble is that the economy gets worse in 2025, then better in 2026+ leading to a repeat of 2018 when Trump lost the house, but even so this will show people the economy is better under republicans and worse under democrats -but this doesn't matter if you cheat- but if Trump gets his way he can force anti-cheating measures everywhere, cut illegal immigration and anchor babies and basically set globohomo/neocons/democrats back 50 years so instead of "white minority 2045" it'll be "white minority 2095". An unintended or unforseen complication is also that Paramount is being sued for anti-white discrimination and this will go to the supreme court, which will likely rule it is in fact illegal to enact DEI policies to discriminate against white males. While the GOP is cucked and doesn't appeal to whites, merely improving the lives of whites the way the 1965 nigger rights act had niggers voting democrat for 200 years will probably flip the midwest republican for a generation (but the democrats probably haven't factored this in).

lol I worked for Whole Foods and got fired to make room for a DEI. Once, I spent an afternoon peeling "mexico" stickers off of vegetables to replace them with "local" stickers. Whole Foods is a scam.

THEN i worked for a marketing company which made phony Yelp and VBulletin accounts, now known as bots. Back in 2009 companies thought that people were too smart to be fooled by regular bots, so they paid for the "hand crafted touch" of bullshit. Whole Foods was our biggest customer.

John Mackey and Whole Foods have been sued several times for with huge fines for false advertising and violations of the FDA's organic standards.

Imagine you’ve paid $100,000 to get a college degree. You’re graduating into a jobs market that is already unprecedented in terms of its competitiveness. Your government now wants to make it x10 more difficult for you or your children to get a decent job by importing as many high skilled immigrants from China, Japan, Singapore, India etc as possible. Now couple that with the DEI drive that the US started in every major corporation and your life chances are severely diminished. Still think that’s fair?

While the pay is shit, the gibs are excellent and many are lifelong. "Veteran" status is one of those protected DEI statuses, even though it doesn't actually mean much (who fucking cares you got shot at 6 year old children in Iraq). You get access to medical benefits, discounted loans/housing programs, college paid for and tons of other perks (like a security clearance). You'll also often get hiring prioritization even with globohomo jobs that normally prefer hiring niggers. There's also those random military discounts companies often have. And I'm not even going to get into the potential to exploit Disability.

However I'd still never join especially not now. They forced COVID jab on everyone and unlike a shitty job doing it it would not be so easy to drop out because of it. They still force other vaxxes. You become property of Israel while enlisted. War is looking very likely either with Russia or Iran or both. If I HAD to join, I'd do Air Force which ive heard has very little combat and is mostly tech.

Related trivia:
- Generally believes in corruption of media and has a right-wing mindset (his honest opinion), covers wide variety of societal issues and conspiracies, but makes fun of conspiracy theorists when convenient.
- Inconsistency: completely avoided talking about covid. Personally, I've had multiple covid posts removed from r/Asmongold. His stance on covid is, approximately "I don't know enough about it to have an opinion, let the experts deal with it, logically putting a piece of cloth on your mouth would reduce particles from sneezing"
- Cautiously defended Blackrock multiple times when it comes to DEI influence on video games and anime localizations (however now accepts the reality of DEI because it's impossible to ignore anymore)
- Previously worked in the government (IRS)
- Doesn't like work, as a history of generating schemes and scams in MMORPGs, owns multiple companies = he is very good businessman and doesn't have morals (which he states all the time)

My conclusion: Night Media, funded by big tech has picked the biggest right-wing appealing influencers and paid them to shut up about covid and other critical plans a part of controlling the narrative. Possibly rigged the algorithm to boost them, capturing the audience to prevent people from seeing real opinions. Blatant lies are normally not effective in right-wing audiences, meanwhile, popularity is, so it's easier to control what streamers DON'T say to make an issue they want to hide look fringe and irrelevant.

Bruh, you need to have a meeting with someone at the DSHS. That's horribly low. I got at least $380. That's so low, it feels like someone is systemically screwing with you.

Also, it's illegal to fire someone for discussing wages.

>Federal law prohibits your employer from disciplining or firing you for discussing your pay and benefits with your coworkers. The National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”) protects your right to discuss your pay with your fellow employees without the fear of retaliation.

Sue and make all the money. Also, if you're white you can claim it was DEI-backed policy and get some anti-woke lawyers on the case. Not joking, companies have been getting into legal trouble for pushing DEI that results in white workers being treated like shit.

>Fake cackling wine aunt
She hates being where she is (but not the power or prestige) and thus puts on a social mask, which she thinks extends to politics. She also drinks/drugs too much and is lazy because DEI hire. This is why she always looks shaken or perturbed by even the slightest questions. She can't think abstractly and come up with zingers, she just has canned lines...Lines she often flubs.

Its not that i don't want to work, it's the large companies litearlly won't fucking hire white dudes right now. Black rock owns all the companies and push their DEI shit so good luck. Unless you're in some very specialized field you ain't fucking getting hired. my last few managers at my last job were a gay latino man who literally had zero interest in helping anyone, a black chick who i'm convinced did literally nothing all day other than say "good morning, i'm off to lunch, good day guy" and a fat latina chick who had a tourettes esque laughing tick and also seemed to do absolutely nothing. I've worked 25+ hours a week since i was 16. I've never seen a job market like this. Shit is wild man. The no work crowd has more and more of an argument when you need to make 100k to "get by". I have no debt and like 140k in the bank and i can't fucking buy a house or find a job. 8 years ago i could have paid cash for a decent house. Now? maybe a camper/RV.

Every little white guy influencer repeats the whole “you were lied to about college it’s a scam” meme I’m sure you’ve heard a million times by now that thousands of people agree with. And then there is the job thing. When they don’t have jobs you tell them to go apply for jobs and when they DO get jobs you complain they’re stealing your jobs—it doesn’t matter if it’s working in a supermarket or an affirmative action (or the trendy “DEI” label”) hire at some tech company. In blacks defense, they can’t win. Might as well uphold to the stereotype to fulfill your expectation.

the sad reality is that we are all beholden to large corporations since entrepreneurship has been assfucked to oblivion since no one can afford to save for start-up capital.

the implication being corporations will push DEI initiaitves and ensure their offices are in multicultural swamps

the other problem is that if white people created a white cheap prosperous region within the US, every shitskin from far and wide would want to leech off of it. so you would need some sort of racial restrictions on property deeds to maintain any type of coherence.

unfortunately you will have to channel your innier white man and go live in the far north since nature is a wonderful filter and the wogs can't tolerate 6 months of darkness

my best guess would be anchorage since the chugs already self segregate

Just steal food, dummy. The cops are too busy with DEI struggle sessions and real crimes to do anything. I have an extra 1000$ cash in my account after payday from reclaiming my money from price fixing farmers and grocers. I’ve effectively given myself a 30~40% pay raise by no longer paying for food.

Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard decide what companies do and who they hire. Your 401k, your IRA, and your company pension buy shares of retirement funds that are run by these companies. The board members, such as Rothschild, that run these three investment firms are the ones deciding to hire brown CEO's, deciding to reduce pay, deciding to implement DEI; and if the CEO doesn't play ball, they throw him/her out. These same board members are connected to large oil and gas firms that keep prices high, to NGO's that flood countries to keep wages low, and to government agencies that inflate our currency by forcing us to give money to contries that then buy their weapons of war. These people have names that are public.

Think of it this way, Jeets and Chinks are flooding into Australia (and Canada), Indonesia is very close to Australia yet there's barely any Indonesians there. Arabs and Niggers will risk everything to come across the ocean in boats just to live with the whites, Jeets would live 25 in one apartment just to be in a white country, Indonesians (who number 280.000.000 people btw) do none of that, they stay in their country (which has its own problems of course) and try to make it better. That's not really the case with Filipinos, there's millions of Filipinas abroad wiping the asses of geriatrics lol. Indonesians also keep Papuan niggers in check, they don't worship them and implement DEI for them. Indonesians are the best non-whites.

Yes. I do. I have. And, this is their message through me, to you and all. Does that surprise you? It should not. You know in your heart it is true and accurate. The greater message is this: all my children together, will come and greet their father! Together. You understand? Some of my children look to the stars--mizar & alcor (Arundhati) -- or even perhaps even Merak and Dubhe, and they do well to do so. But in any event...the children of earth do well to incline their heads and recognize my beloved children; AND DO THEM NO HARM. I, says "THE GOD" shall surely repay them, and cut them off forever. if they harm my children. If you understand, kneel and give thanks; if you do not, abandon your life. Bend your stiff neck for the executioner, and feel all yirness incarage. our perversions and phantasmagoria hit the adamantine, stone wall of perfect truth. It is as merciful, as it is unforgiving, is it not? Life for the man. Darkness for the traitor. Oblivion, what better and kinder? From now, who lives and why, must show his heart and soul. I hope you understand, akhi. Don't answer me but make your peace with GOD. Pax Dei, if you can bear it. May you be cursed UNLESS God says otherwise!!! Let truth be life, and let lies be death.

They stopped thinking and started following a predictive AI system is my guess.
This, like with NASA type "human" systems, means they lost a lot of institutional knowledge and experience. Thus all the WEF and Nepo retards everywhere working to a plan they themselves don't understand.

They seem to know there's a problem as there's been some coms about "speeding up initiations". Masons and cults in general like to make the newbie-to-master process as long and drawn out as possible once the top brass/ranks have gotten comfortable being on top (and don't want any real competition), but that means they're less able to replace missing limbs when they're in real conflict and losing people. Maybe even as a generational thing, too many oldies are dying and too few (useful, competent, trustworthy) newbies are coming through.

Nepos don't want to serve the time in the trenches like the regular newbies do, so this creates an understanding among newbies that Nepos will always "get the promotion" over them. So it's the same forces as DEI in the corporate world (which is structured following masonic practices - where useful idiots are locked at a lower level & "milked" while connected & "preferential" types get the accelerated route upwards), so we're seeing the increasing dependence on "Artificial White People" (AI) systems as newbies tap out or join new atomized factions within the greater organization.

They way that works, I think, is that boomers continue to convert a fuck ton of liquid cash into metal.
They want to keep prices down so this continues to function as an adequate liquidity sink.
What's fucked up about it is metals are scarce. I know lots of boomers retardedly by paper metal, but lots buy the real thing, and even though there's like tungsten filled gold, still, most is legit.

Like, okay they want to keep prices down so the liquidity vacuum still works.
I'm just going to assume they've robbed the gold from sovereign wealth accounts to sell to boomers at Costco. That's the only way it makes sense.

The main purpose of the economy, as far as I can tell, is to suck liquidity out however possible.
That's why fast food prices are high.
What's fucked up is obviously BlackRock or someone has "made the phone call" and these price policies are not organic, like DEI. But that's a FLAGRANT violation of every US economic regulation that exists.
But they just fucking do it anyway because our government is now fake too.

Don't get me started. Global warming is fake as shit, it's the worst science I've ever scene, high school physics debunks it. And yet, it's ubiquitous. Actual PhD scientists (in other disciplines) buy the narrative because they don't look into it deeply and NO ONE can psychologically fathom how deeply coordinated false narrative realities are in the West and how pathetic the non-West is in its media game.

Then why are no journalists looking at commodity prices, supply chains, labor force?
A fuckton of pertinent information in our world hides behind "company proprietary NDA" shit.

Like, we can factually conclude that BlackRock can intimidate and must have intimidated boards into adopting DEI. We know that someone has to be defining DEI and its enforcement and it's not the government, i.e.: NGOs, philanthropy orgs. We know they're working with BlackRock.
It's transparently obvious.

Why has not one single CEO or board member or company secretary in the entire economy EVER spoken out, or why hasn't ANY somewhat major news organization ever uncovered this explicit practice?
We know from traders, insiders, consultants that there is common knowledge of these things happening.
It's certainly an issue of major public interest.

Yet, crickets...
I have a few thoughts responding to this. Mainly, there's fuckery abound. I wouldn't just blame COVID aftershocks. There's major fuckery abound.
Second, it must be the case that the Obama admin and Soros have set up some kind of media fusion centers that have mainstream news on narrative lockdown, but also apparently coordinate with corporate boards, the DoJ, alphabets, and finance. Credit card companies. Like, it's all coordinated and messaging and perception driven. Like a total, universal platform that tries to encompass all that it can.
I became suspicious of this when narrative spill over from bullshit like gamergate or "russian trolls hate star wars" not only spilled into the mainstream news, but make it into government statements. Since when did the Minnesota board of elementary education coordinate with JJ Abrams's press team and the state department was involved?

Sure, it could all be post-modern culture, deference to the "message" and "current thing". Maybe largely ginned up by social media corps and ideologues there. Still, man, it really does seem like you get the "they got the phone call" effect.

That it is. It's also the heaviest fire that the navy has taken, since WW2. So, it's having a large psychological effect on the burger DEI mutt troops also, just not nearly as much as the kikes. Many will likely not volunteer for more rounds of missions, and most DEI mutt troops refuse to help protect shitrael.

Defense isn't cheap, and that last Iran attack cost $100M to launch. But, it cost shitrael $1.35B to defend against the slow moving 9 hour attack, and I don't even think that includes the cost of the burgers and other western countries that helped down the missiles and drones.

>Why obsess so much on race?
There's generally more focus on race in the US today, compared to the 90s, because "critical theories" of race and a push toward greater "equity" have become an entire industry. It's basically disaster capitalism; if I can make racism seem like a public health emergency, I can make more money selling my anti-racism books, getting paid speaking engagements, getting positions in universities, selling my DEI training to corporations, getting invited on TV shows, etc. I make more money if racism is worse, so I'm going to make it seem like it's a gigantic problem. The reality is, compared to many Asian countries, Western countries aren't racist at all.

Well see here's the thing, nobody voted for her. Why would she receive a post convention bump given she was selected? That's the time for the voters to solidify around their choice, after beating out all other rivals. If there's no other rivals to consolidate votes from, then WHY would we see ANY effect at all? You can't even compare it to previous elections, there's nothing to consolidate around. Her support is already peaked to it's maximum and, as we see, is starting to tail off and dropping back down.

Funny just like her own failed run in 2020. She has Biden to thank for being his token DEI. But as with all people who didn't earn it, they also have no skill to succeed.

No Only fans as well as other platforms such as youtube and twitch are representations of years of misalocation of capital caused by low interest rates.


When Interest rates are low for long periods of time, people and institutions consume more than they can afford.

For individuals this translates as taking loans for cars,college,real estate or other forms of "buy now pay later" such as credit cards.

For institutions this translates as loans and external investiments in order to grow fast at the cost of profitability and sustainability.

companies hire lots of people for well paying,useless white collar jobs such as managing,social media, DEI and HR.

Suddenly you have all these young,single and childless people getting out of college straight into a 6 figures job. With all that money what do they do? invest? save? nah they consume.

Why make your own coffee if you can buy starbucks? why make your own food if you can call doordash? why approach women or go to strip club if you can send a 100 bucks to a 10/10 white girl on OF?

Naturally that mass consumption leads to a lot of profits in these sectors.

Also, most of the high earning chicks on OF are likely laundering money for crime orgs.

>DEI explained

There is the government level which gives tax breaks and other incentives to hire everyone who is not a White man.
Then there is the "free market" which is controlled by the kikes (they control the banks, including the central bank which is in reality just a (((private and independent))) organization a cartel of Jewish private banks), which invests on companies depending on their ESG score, so again if you hire people that are not White men, you get more investment, and these investment dollars is what the companies are after.

The entire system is designed to topple the White man who built our countries from positions of power. The Jews do not have the numbers to man all the posts themselves, so they create these systems to indirectly control them through replacing White men with people that are more easily controllable and follow the Jewish agenda.

The Roman church system is the whore of Babylon, and she rides on the beast; the body politics of the western (Christian) nations.
France and every fundamental Roman Catholic nation suffered and will suffer immense punishments because of that false religious system. Because they exalt this son of perdition, this antichrist (in-place-of Christ) Papal dynasty, the Roman beast and its image. "Vicarivs Filii Dei", the Roman numerals of this man's name add up to 666, as is the Greek word "Lateinos" (Roman man), the Greek numerals add up to 666 again.
God is a jealous God, he won't share his glory with anyone, especially not this filthy Roman institution that murdered tens of millions of Christians for their testimony of Jesus Christ (the Word of God). They burned them for reading and translating and daring to speak up according to the Bible word. That is the spirit of Rome, and Papal Rome was far more influential and deadly and killed far more Christians than Pagan Rome did. And now this whore is still around and acts as if nothing happened, and she did nothing wrong. They won't repent, and Rome never changes (except it is forced to). The exaltation of mortal men is the very nature of this institution.
Millions of Christians payed with their lives and were burned at the stake so that we have a Bible in our hands (the "gold tried in the fire" Revelation 3:18), and very few even acknowledge and appreciate that.
In our current modern world, we are now around chapter 18 in the Revelation.

Though the mistake that lots of Christians do today is they glorify Rome because of that. It's the beast of Revelation with the death wound that was healed. Pagan Rome transformed to Papal Rome and brought a reign of opression and dark age because the word of God was suppressed for 1260 years (a day for a year prophetic principle). Then the little open book was back again in the hands of the people (Revelation 10 and 11) and brought Europe out of those dark ages into an age of actual progress, freedom, exploration, and bloom. But now Christianity is unfortunately filled with counter-reformation schemes from the Roman Church (Futurism), and they buried Protestant Historicism. The Reformers very much understood the Revelation.
No one could "buy or sell" in those dark ages of total Papal dominance, your nation had to have the support of the Papacy, and no one could afford a Bible or even read it since it was only in Latin. You had to have the mark of the beast and worship its image (Rome, the dragon), the mark is not a literal mark, it's a mindset in your forehead and you are captive by that (your right hand), you had to act according to the Papal Roman system. You couldn't do anything without the Papal beast, the substitute for Christ, vicarivs filii dei = 666, and it's still in existence today. It is the mystery of iniquity, the mystery Babylon system. Everything wrong in this world comes from this Roman-Babylonian system.
That there are still people in the Roman church today only proves how ignorant people are. They have the Bible open and they still don't get it, they still want to follow humanistic inventions and superficial splendour and ignore the plain word of God.
The Roman beast is globohomo, and people still glorify its image, and it's dominating every aspect our life and worldview; at least those who are not rooted in the word of God (the book of life).
>Revelation 19:10 [...] worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

I think they know they've gone too far.
they thought they could secularize the Muslims they brought in.
sure you might be able to do that with the wealthier ones but not your average Muslim. Islam is a bulwark against all their shit and their women are too controlled to be subverted.
they're only willing participants when it suits them

indoctrinated brownoids (non Muslims) are easily programmed but the mind virus isn't so easily removed. you can't train a people to place the blame on all that's bad in their lives on whites and expect them to suddenly want to take personal ownership and responsibility. not going to happen

I absolutely agree with this
>They want you and the browns to fight each other for their interests
but they never counted on the golems turning on them, they were never supposed to be the target, just whites

this was coming for awhile. Erik Weinstein was bitching about blacks and women shouting him down for being a white male at his university. he kvetched because the Dean wouldn't support him. fast forward 10 years those indoctrinated college kids are now in places of power thanks to DEI.

The only top notch parts of the US military are their strategic nuclear submarine force, and ISR. The rest of the military isn't great, and military production isn't near adequate for a war against a real adversary.
Can't produce enough of anything even to keep Ukraine. Russia, with a GDP comparable to Canada or Italy, produces 3x as many artillery shells as ALL nato countries combined.
The US only produces 600 patriot AA interceptor missiles a year
China's ship building capacity is 230x America's.

NATO's combined arms doctrine is based around squashing Saddam's puny army and counter insurgency. It presupposes complete air superiority, which is by no means a guarantee in a peer war.

The whole military is also suffering from all the problems blighting the west. DEI compatible low standards at military academies, demoralizing shit like tranny generals and women drill instructors, and vax mandates.

American society will decay further, but order will mostly remain in place because people are comfortable. The tipping point will be the next major natural disaster, whether that be a hurricane like Katrina, or an especially large earthquake. It will knock out existing utilities, and DEI hires will be unable to deal with the engineering or electronic issues that causes. This will be the spark of the American race war, as niggers and other minorities will begin attacking whites first (just like Katrina), and they will gain temporary ground until around day three or four, when the surviving whites begin just shooting brown people on sight (again just like Katrina), at which point the scales will tip completely in favor of whites.

The "nothing ever happens" fags are full of shit, normie whites stacked so many nigger bodies during Katrina that the corpses overflowed the hospitals and filled a sports stadium. That's the reality of the police: their primary job is to play referee and stop the race war from starting, and without them, shitskins are cooked. Defund the police = total nigger death. If the utilities had stayed offline for another few weeks in Florida, the state may have actually been ethnically cleansed. This time, the chaos will be far worse. This is post-Floyd, post-Covid, post-Lockdowns, post-stolen election. People aren't just angrier, they're more violent and deranged.

The next major natural disaster, whatever it is, all hell is going to break lose.

They sniff out gamestudios with big money in their pockets and then "look for" problems, which means they just throw any shit that works at them and if it doesnt exist they will just make something up, and then the blackmail the company with bad reviews and negative commentary to hire them for advise. (((Journalists))) jump on that train because they can just make up shit and always complain about literally nothing regarding this subject without even wasting time to understand the product.

Dei is a form of collectivism. As with any leftist movement, production comes secondary to ideology. We exist in strange times where there exists high demand for individuals who value autonomy, willing to serve others looking to pay good money for services rendered conscientiously. It is very strange but I will tell you I know many self employed men, myself included, who earn more money than doctors it's true.

The last company I worked for went public and went from a apolitical family business environment to a completely toxic Bolshevized political environment overnight. The IPO was in June so a pride flag went up overnight in the cafe, and it was the one with the tranny colors and the black and brown stripes.. They then hired about two
hundred black people (not joking, I had 4 new black people I worked with within a couple months) Going public very nearly ran the company into the ground and they had to lay off a huge portion of the workforce.

Now, I had an interview yesterday at a corporate HQ for a big company that does about $10 Billion in revenue each year.

Every single person I saw and met was White. No indians, no blacks, no Asians. Completely White. I passed at least 100 people in the hallway since it was right at the time everyone was returning from lunch, so I got a good sample size.

How is it possible for such a huge company to be outside the control of the Blackrock-US Government extortion racket that we know as "DEI"?

Is it simply a matter of time before they figure out about this organization and Bolshevize it?

Has anyone else seen their workplace turn into a weird Leftist cult overnight?

1. You're a malicious idiot. Die ASAP.

2. Racist is nothing more than an antiwhite slur, used against good and honest people.

3. She's a woman. Inherently clueless and intellectually inferior to men such as myself.

4. DEI is antiwhite discrimination and is only intended to cause harm. Things were perfectly fine before the push to hire and promote inferior/incompetent people. Women and minorities held positions if they were worthy of them. Representation was what would be expected in a fair or mostly-fair system.

Bonus two:

5. Blacks are fucking horrible in every way and it's normal for everyone to want to be far away from them.

6. Whites are the very best of humanity and it's 100% normal, healthy, and morally good for whites to only want to be around other whites, the only people that will not constantly vilify them for existing and being so fucking hot, smart, and excellent at pretty much everything.

2. You Had something to do with me being kicked out of school.
3. You tried to entrap me by provoking me, throw me in jail
4. You went out of your way to find information about me, talked to my cousin and stuff. (I assume, since you are building this whole narrative about me)

All this stems from what?

2. I shitted on what his face Trumps son in law “muh prince”
3. I’m showing the influence money has on our government with AIPAC as a prime example?

You are not going to turn is into Palestinians or treat us like second class citizens in our own country.

Enabling a genocide to prevent the perception of a perceived future one.
Enabling of a rotted system for prevent the perception of a holocaust.

You are not going to fucking turn is into second class citizens in our own country.

And Trump should make that very fucking clear.

Don't kid yourself idiot, she's sending money to Israel, too.

Honestly, it's smart politics. Everyone knows the debt is never getting paid back, so might as well loot what's left of the treasury before the consequences come to buy votes and get yours. She'll be long gone before the consequences come.

Anyone who's not a retard understands that just like with student loans and healthcare, once the government gets involved in subsidizing the purchase of a thing, it just drives up the cost of that thing, so in the long run it makes the thing more expensive while also running up the national debt. Oh, and you better believe this money will go to "undocumented immigrants" and be parceled out along DEI lines.

This stuff works. It's the best argument against the entire concept of mass democracy there is, in my opinion.

No they certainly can't. But not necessarly for the reasons we think about. When we try to figure out their costs/margin, we think at the most efficient ways to produce their food and use it as ground basis.
We don't think at the army of DEI blue haired nigresses in HR, useless paper pushing cunts in cubicle offices doing imaginary work, we don't think at the thousands of galons of oil wasted by each franchise every year to retarded hygiene policies, nor at the cost of properly getting rid of it.

neither. it's the fault of the institutions, businesses, and bankers. women want a man that makes $100k because that's what's realistically required to live a comfortable life and have children (yes, obviously you can have children with much less, but you won't be comfortable). we are living through the downstream effects of greed.

>education is exponentially more expensive every year because federal student loans will get approved no matter the cost
>both schools and bankers profit from this arrangement
>schools are incentivized to make education take longer
>businesses want people with degrees, even if the position could easily be trained
>businesses don't want to hire unless you have 3-5 yrs experience
>houses are twice as expensive as they should be as adjusted for inflation from 1971
>DEI gatekeeps white men from education and jobs regardless of their skill/education/experience (violation of civil rights act)

Rascism describes the natural state of human beings, it's imposible to get rid of, since getting rid of rascism would mean getting rid of one-self, also, It only applies to white people, white people are so superior that they need to self-impose restrictions on themselves to give the other races a chance, meaning that DEI and its supporters are actually rascist and sexist since they imply these groups can't reach a position through merit.
So in esence, everyone is still practising rascism and forever will. Its just that liberals practice It through covert means of fraud, because they can't admit the truth, or they know and hope one day it will cease through inter-breeding, another ridiculous postulation, that will gather the epigenetic drive of white people into exterminating them, along with the minorities that took sdvantage of their good will.

This only happens when women don't use the government to rape men's wallets at gunpoint to transfer money and power into their hands. Now that they have government gibs and divorce courts-- they give no shits about crawling back to any man. Corporations also hire women for unqualified make work DEI positions and they are almost unfirable. They only good news is that the situation is not sustainable. The bad news is what is happening now and what happens next in the short term. Kamala is talking food price fixing-- so famine incoming. Then collapse. Either we take it all back or we become conquered and killed by shitskins and kike enablers who keep these women for sex toys and domestic slaves or... slay them at their choosing.
