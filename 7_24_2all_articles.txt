Women taking over positions of power is just an extension of wokeness. Trump will win, most assuredly, but even the RNC is woke now, and the racists will be pacified with Trump as President. They will still push BBC spam just like they did when Trump was President with BLACKED. They've done it before and they will do it again to spawn a new generation of BBC-loving degenerates.

Trump is now at this point just a pawn in the game, he's not going to do anything to the political system but give people renewed confidence in the economic market. It will change nothing about DEI and wokeness.

White people fell hook, line and sinker for the meritocracy meme. No other culture on the planet practices it save for those from Europe or descended from Europeans. It's why we're getting a bunch of Indians in tech companies now and why Jews have historically done very well. If you're considered one of them it opens many doors. It's nepotism all the way down. I can't even get mad, because they're looking out for one another, and the only reason Whites are losing due to DEI and affirmative action is because we haven't played that game since the French Revolution.

It's all so weak mostly because she's really done nothing. No major scandals, but no major accomplishments either. She's an incompetent and not-too-intelligent party woman who got promoted through connections and through DEI. In a sane world she should be nowhere near the presidency.

That being said it's basically forbidden to point this out in modern America, and coupled with the fact that she's running against Trump, I'm currently giving her a 50% shot.

She’ll never be more popular than she is right now. It’s literally only down from here.

Right now, she’s the greatest candidate of all time. The greatest VP of all time. The best resume of all time. She’s the right color. And omg, have you heard, she’s a woman. She’s perfect! And especially compared to Trump! Oh man!

…that’s the narrative right now. She’s the shiny new toy.

But soon, she’ll open her mouth. She’ll give a speech. She’ll do something dumb. Somebody will leak a thing about some stuff.

And then the shine will dull, and people will remember why no one supported her campaign in 2020, why no one in her own party likes her, and why she’s been relegated to the sidelines these last 3 years as the DEI VP.

She is peaking right now (and in the days ahead). But shit man, it’s only July 22. And given the speed at which this political cycle is moving, that’s wayyyy too early to peak.

By September, I’d expect polls to normalize with Trump up by a comfortable 3-5 pts in the swing states.

Literally the only thing Trump can do to screw this up is agree to debate her.

he needs competent engineers to make that shit, and a country with an economy that can afford to pay for them

wokeness and DEI are directly leading the US into becoming a south-american style corrupt, uncompetitive welfare state
they're creating a massive welfare class and explicitly disallowing companies, universities and the government from merit-based hiring/admittance
you can't run high tech companies if all your college graduates are 80iq nignogs or women.

Just disband this useless SS, charge every SS agent who fucked up with a felony to take away their money and their job, and then put the responsibilites to the FBI with a special unit for president protection and anti-money laundering operations.

The assassination attempt on Trump proved one thing and that's that the SS is a complete failure with DEI waste of space who can't even holster the fucking weapon and a planning that is worse than what a complete retard with an ar15 can come up with.

The USA should be renamed into the fake USA, because everything is fake and just words on paper. The paper says the SS is there to pretect the president. The reality is that they don't protect the president and just hussle tax payer money.

The SS is so bad, that it's better to just ask local gangs to protect you than a billions of dollor "special force".

Larry had been grooming Trump and America for this one single moment.

He forced companies to adopt DEI until the American people got fed up with it. He wants America to hate DEI so much that they would elect Trump into power, who would then grant Larry ludicrous power. We've been playing right into his hands.

We thought Trump was playing 6D chess, but it turns out Larry was moving the pieces the whole time.

She's going to do worse with women than Joe Biden would have. She inspires none of the maternal protective instincts that an infirm retard like Joe Biden does. She inspires hatred from all the women who hate when other bitches fuck the boss to get promotions. Still there's a lot of whores out there who think that makes her powerful and yas kween, so she'll still get a lot of women votes.

But as soon as people are reminded of Kamala's voice and cackle (there's a reason why she's been hidden away the last four years), every male voter who isn't a completely demoralized cuck will run away from her screaming.

As for racism, we saw how Obama's numbers dropped in 2012 after the "first black president" effect wore off, and all everyone has been talking about the last week is how DEI hires are a disaster on the national stage after the USSS scandals.

Yes, the jewish right. All of these policies had the goal of advancing jewish racial nationalism.

They don't actually oppose far-right policies, they just oppose pro anglo-european far right policies.

>covering up all windows and doors to vote counting rooms
>the graph suddenly spiking vertically upwards for Biden at the very end of the count
>liberals stuffing like 30 ballots into the box caught on news livestreams

They purposely let a retarded zoomer shoot Trump in the head, 1cm from assassinating him.
>watched him use a drone to scope out the venue
>watched him use a rangefinder on Trump
>watched him cycle around with a rifle
>watched him climb a ladder onto the most obvious fucking rooftop directly across from trump
>watched as he got into position and aimed his rifle at trump
>let him get multiple shots off hitting him in the head, before even attempting to stop him
it was an inside job even more obvious than the JFK assassination (more obvious thanks to DEI in the secret service).

There are 106 days left until the 5th November, 106 days of the deep state fighting against Trump becoming president to ensure that the democrats can trigger a world war between the east and the west, Ukraine is the key. Trump will end the Ukraine war within months of being President, they will not allow it.

>If you go full Brazil mode you will get a spectrum of people from vanilla to mocha. People will then self select into castes. For example, a light skinned person with low IQ, poor impulse control an no startup capital will struggle to find acceptance among their own, so they end up socialising with darker people. Conversely, a highly intelligent and conscientious dark person will end up moving into the light tribe.
Carry on for a few generations and you will have an even more stratified society than before. Right now you have arbitrary race differences based on ancient ancestry, but in a Brazilified world you will have actual castes born of assortative breeding.

DEI is an effective strategy to destroy complex systems. Trump getting killed may or may not have been the specific intent in that case and it would be a desirable outcome for the DEI pushers (jews) regardless.
The point of DEI in corporations, government an academia is to destroy all those systems, presumably so they can be taken over by jews, which is what has happened and continues to happen.
Remember when that black female university president said something that wasn't negative toward palestinians, and then was immediately replaced by a jewish man?

1. immediately ban all forms of welfare, as they are keeping single moms "free" and "independent" - this will increase the need of a second provider in the household, and since women are hating each other, it must be a man, thus, a husband
2. slowly (within 4-5 years of coasting), eliminate all women from colleges, vocational schools (like trades), military, governmental jobs and other professions that enables them to be higher paid (or where the job itself is a form of welfare, like DEI in military, gov, corporations etc).
An anon on 4chan said a while ago something memorable: a woman in need will breed. that's why we literally have myths and stories with Perseus saving Andromeda from being sacrificed (usually people forget that the hero gets the spoils of the battle, like the girl itself to be his concubine).
Women on average have a smaller brain than men; they thrive on pain and suffering; they don't like it, but they thrive on it. Women must be either fucked or beaten, as the brain parts responsible of each of them (the 4 Fs - feed, fuck, flight, fight) over-lap. Sometimes sex and beating in one session - aka rape. That's why they fantasize rape. That's why when they are depressed they over-eat or they "flight" to their moms. All 4 Fs overlap. If you don't believe me, look up the statistics, where decent calm mellow men were divorced-raped and their women ran away with literally domestic abusers. They are asking for it. BEAT OF FUCK. That's why they are wetting themselves for niggers. They know it's coming, one or the other.

Problem with all of this is corporations somehow thought they can make money of it with no regard for what people and employees actually want
Maybe the idea was to crash unionization. Who would want to unionize with niggers?
That being said while I was working for FAANG company we had a staff engineer who was black as coal and his “white” name was something along the lines of Treasure of Montezumo, despite this he wrote the best Scala code I have ever seen
I am pretty sure if DEI was about actually giving a chance talented minorities there wouldn’t be such a pushback against it

They certainly have a candidate problem but the actual billionaires that run the country are realizing that they can't have a DEI run country and maintain stability. It's going to be a bumpy ride for them. I don't really know where they go from here either.

They are stuck in this catch 22 of being the brown leftoid party but then needing competent white people/jews to get anything done. Everything you see about Kamala right now is complete astroturf.

Because that faggot is the one who was reponsible for pushing DEI which we all know has been an utter shit show for putting trained monkeys into positions they had no right being in considering their skill and discipline level.

It went from being unspoken standard to financial dogma so much so that every single person who depended on loans to push their business was approved or denied based on DEI factors so basically all those money hungry hogs bent the knee as fast as they could and even held competition amongst each other on just how many truly useless jobs that were created to feed and house these useless cunts and fags and jeets and niggers and spics so that it could be further used to demoralize anyone working hard under their own steam.

Trump's fundamental flaw is that he is disloyal to those who are loyal to him, and loyal to those who are disloyal to him. A good leader rewards loyalty and punishes disloyalty; Trump does the exact opposite, then acts surprised when he keeps getting screwed over by his subordinates, over and over again. He's not the strategic genius that some people make him out to be. He's a lucky retard - lucky for him, though, not for those who believe in him.

Look at what happened to Trump's loyalists from 2016. Steve Bannon? Currently in federal prison. Jeff Sessions, who tried to clean up the drug problem by going after dealers (which is what Trump promised to do in 2016)? Got removed from office by Trump. All the January 6 people, who were stupid enough to heed Trump's call and go to the Capitol? Suffering in prison, with literal African mercenaries for guards, and several of them have already died. Oh, and the guy who got shot instead of Trump during the assassination attempt? Trump - with his gay little bandage - didn't even turn up to the guy's funeral, and is now telling his supporters that God wanted it to be this way, even though Trump himself is a lifelong atheist.

Oh, but don't worry. Jared Kushner, who distanced himself from Trump's policies every step of the way? He's rich and free, having never faced any consequences for his blatant financial corruption with regards to Saudi Arabia. Benjamin Netanyahu, who threw Trump under the bus the moment he felt that Biden would win? He's still in power, and Trump's groveling to him again. Larry Fink, who bankrolled a lot of Trump's political and judicial opponents in 2016-2021 and is personally responsible for DEI being pushed everywhere? He might be put in charge of the Treasury if Trump wins.

The only thing I wonder is whether I should feel sorry for Trump's supporters for being misled, or whether I should hate them for being wilfully ignorant.

it's like Mitt Romney multiplied by a million and then spread throughout corporate management in every single company. DEI completely broke the spine of american labor and the middle class - you could have nuked the country and it would have recovered better than what this poison has done

If I was a grand conspiracy illuminati master who wanted to restore the seat of western power to europe instead of the anglo colonies i must say the plan is proceeding perfectly. Next step: OPen racism in europe.

Who would have thought that foreigners aren't invested in their ESG/DEI/BRIDGE fuckery? Who would have guessed that natives in a country don't like their history changed by foreigners? These questions are literally never asked because the unspoken assumption is that the "liberal" white man owns the entire planet, so of course everybody else agrees with the liberal white man, why wouldn't they?

The whole world is the libral white man's oyster, if he tells you that blacks were super samurai, then they were, what are you going to do about that, little native non-white "people"? Don't be racist now, let the liberal white man shove the dildo of tolerance in your asses, let the liberal white man use foreigners as a battering ram against your culture.

Of course Japan was a hotbed of slavery, what are you going to do about it, little native non-whites? You aren't racists, are you?

I'm probably alone in this but I don't buy the cheap labor horse shit anymore, not in 2024. Spics came here because they would work for less and take that money back where it meant more. Once they discovered how to gangbang our broken ass welfare system they could have everything else paid for (housing, healthcare, food, and in some states even vehicles) so the money they actually work for just goes for beer and shit like that. I seem to remember once several years back they had a some limp-dick protest where immigrants wouldn't go to work and made a sort of deal about it. You know what happened that day? Absofuckinglutely nothing. Most of your citizens are struggling to even get bottom jobs in a shattered DEI system that only hires browns or illegals regardless of ability or merit. I don't think anyone will ever convince me deporting illegals would be anything but a positive for America. You certainly failed to do so, meme flag. See you around 3 pm when you make this same thread again.

Mostly, at least for the jobs that have a high wage but require only a moderate amount of work.
The jobs that actually need to get shit done are still staffed based on meritocracy (mostly at least), but you will also be slaved to death because you need to compensate for the fuck ups of all the DEI hires.
So you do 12 hours a day, out of which you can only record 10 because that's the legal limit, and are then told to take those 2 hours off some other day.
But that day never comes so instead they simply slash your OT account by some 50% or so at the end of the year.

I’ve met a few. One was into me, a biological man, and hadn’t gone too far. Just looked like a pixie girl with the sides shaved and a knot tie like a hipster. She didn’t develop a mustache or any manly physiology, but there was definitely a boost in intensity and hyperactivity. More “dominance” traits. Even a lesbian at the bar I met this person warned me in advance and laughed the next week.

The other was more recent and was basically Reddit personified down to the Dungeons and Dragons bullshit and had an army of neckbeard simps. This person was just an insufferable cunt toward everyone and wanted to basically “own” the establishment like someone being territorial. Ironically she’s not from the area. Like a DEI agent saying that the place needs to be more far left, BLM, etc. She also gives off groomer/ unicorn hunter vibes.

And Dems started saying it was staged and the bullet didn't really hit him. If Trump went all blaming Dems it would make him look crazy. The softer Trump helped him. He is literally pulling ahead in every poll.

The GOP was simply too retarded to capitalize on a miracle that fell directly in their laps. They instantly went to shitposting about DEI secret service instead of attacking dems for ostensible divisive, violent rhetoric that lead to this situation in the first place. The fact that the dems can now play the reversal and use the fear invoked by the attempt to rally around a return-to-normal, stability and security candidate is telling of which party is more organized and confident.

Lmao, reminds me of when Hillary supporters coped about Trump in 2016. It was desperate then, too. It doesnt come across as any less desperate now.

People should comment "I hope she puts trump into slave labor like she did all those weed smoking first time offender young black Californians." So people have to Google the truth about her actions as a prosecutor.

But it really doesn't matter because Trump is going full DEI/ESG with Larry Fink.

Repost of something I wrote earlier because the more I think about it the more likely it seems.

I feel like the Democrats just want to get MADAME PRESIDENT as some sort of pat on the back of DEI but if Harris becomes president because Biden is forced out and loses in November that's a really, really bad look for them. It makes more sense to me that Biden will resign before the convention and Harris will at some point between now and then announce she won't seek the nomination. That way the Democrats can say they made a nigger female president and send some underling to lose to Trump in November. Plus, depending on how shit goes for Harris, she could come back in four years and run in a better climate. Never underestimate the communists obsession with "history" making.

I agree with you. I don’t believe they can sell Harris. Biden had a lot of familiarity and popularity because of the Obama administration. Harris was unpopular in 2020 and dropped out after the first debate because Tulsi Gabbard completely destroyed her. She is completely forgettable as a VP and was literally picked as a DEI hire. They also simply don’t have enough time to convincingly sell this. Voters have had 4 years of Joe Biden and may or may not like what they got. But they have had ZERO years of Kamala Harris. In this sense, Trump is the incumbent now with his 4 years of experience already in the office. We are living in uncertain economic and geopolitical times and I don’t think there’s enough of a base to gamble on an unpopular and unproven candidate like that right now. People are looking for a sense of safety and security and while I don’t think Trump is going to flip very many Democrat voters, I think a lot of them simply won’t vote this time. Enough to make plausibly rigging it not worth the effort.

i feel like the Democrats just want to get MADAME PRESIDENT as some sort of pat on the back of DEI but if Harris becomes president because Biden is forced out and loses in November that's a really, really bad look for them. It makes more sense to me that Biden will resign before the convention and Harris will at some point between now and then announce she won't seek the nomination. That way the Democrats can say they made a nigger female president and send some underling to lose to Trump in November. Plus, depending on how shit goes for Harris, she could come back in four years and run in a better climate. Never underestimate the communists obsession with "history" making.

It couldn't be more obvious. Even the best candidate the Dems could find isn't a guaranteed win against Trump after recent events.. Dem operatives had so little faith in Biden's ability to win after the debate that they sicced their dogs in the media on him, and it's thrown the entire party into a frenzy. The smart ones, like Newsom, want no part of this shitshow and are waiting for 28. Why do you think they've kept their precious DEI pick Kamala in the shadows the last 4 years? It's because she's a fucking embarrassment every time she opens her mouth. Whoever loses to Trump is the whipping boy and Kamala, who has no close friends within the party, has drawn the short stick. At the same time, a Trump victory isn't a guarantee either. The Dems suspect they'll lose, but they still intend to go down swinging.

Her purpose now is to debate Trump so that Trump can be a bit of an old fashioned rough gentleman with her to clean up his image as a falsely accused sex offender. She will even go as far as saying she believes those accusations are false. She will do this in an attempt to seem level headed in her retarded mind.

the people moving to red states from blue states are more conservative on average. this has been shown through many different data points. besides, 10 years ago, nearly all republican state legislators and governors were just chamber of commerce bootlickers. now, red states are starting to adopt more substantively conservative policies like anti-DEI, constitutional carry, pornography bans, anti-abortion, etc.

Let's be reasonable for a second and think about what is best for the country and pretend that we are good faith democrats.
You have a large population of people who are stuck in poverty, committing crime, doing drugs, and stuck in a cycle. It is not good for the nation that anybody be in poverty, both from a productivity and moral standpoint. They will not get out of this cycle on their own, so there has to be some kind of support for them. This is the mentality behind affirmative action. The DEI system of today boldly rejects Whites at nearly every turn. It deprioritizes them in the workplace, education system, and forces them to humiliate themselves. You say we will be right back to where we are now in 30 years, but what if we aren't? What if we learn from this?

I am not woo woo affirmative action, but it does in some ways make sense. And you did not see this open discrimination against Whites in the 90s. For better or worse, blacks are Americans and a part of the population. Democrats today with their system have deliberately kept them in ghettos chasing their tails and blamed "white supremacy." The point is that he is not an anti-White, and that is a fact. He has been the only candidate to even acknowledge White people. That is worth something.

It's very simple. Affirmative action was doing what DEI is doing, just the damage hadn't accumulated enough to reach critical mass. If you were to eliminate all the diversity hires and then scale back DEI to just 90's affirmative action, then we'd just be back to where we are now in another 30 years.

The man is an old school democrat, and when affirmative action was made it did have its place. You had a massive poor black population with no real way to escape poverty. What you have today is explicit discrimination against Whites at nearly every level rather than a small helping hand for blacks. We functioned just fine with affirmative action for decades. It was not until the woke mafia came in and started outright rejecting White candidates by virtue of being White that a problem presented itself.

Therein lies the problem though
We've had a DEI system that has benefitted women at the expense of men for several decades now and it's resulted in men that are economically unattractive for women, as women want men who make significantly more than them as a rule
You can't have it both ways, either we allow men to earn more than women by cutting government interference in the economy or women will have to deal with being the primary breadwinners half the time, which means no time for raising your young children

America's averages 98 IQ, down from 100+ in years past. Go look at American demographics. America is barely 50% white, and less than 5% East Asian. 1/8 are Black and 1/4 are Hispanic. This is exacerbated by low birth rates for whites and esp. East Asians, while Hispanic rates are still above replacement, and huge numbers of refugees enter through Biden's open border. America's schools have also declined in quality, with more focus on DEI nonsense over fundamentals, and watering down fundamentals so that everybody passes the same classes. America's average IQ is going to keep dropping for decades to come.

He literally just talked about that at his Michigan rally on Saturday talking about he has been purging the Republican party of it and will try to get remove the Democrat members as well. As for the wall he talked about that the RNC speech as well saying he will complete what he started which the Democrat party in Congress kept blocking so he had to use military funds to start it.

>In 2016 he said h1bs are being abused to keep labor costs down, and now he's pushing for more h1bs.
Haven't seen him push for more H1B visas. He did mention allowing more student visas and offering them work visas for about a week before completely backtracking after backlash.

>His vice president very recently said they should attack Iran first, and Trumps largest donor again this cycle is Adelsons widow, who said she wanted him to push for Israel to get the West Bank.
Vance isn't in charge. Adelson's widow isn't the biggest donor anymore. It is now Musk and Thiel through PACS. The single biggest donor through the campaign is Tim Melton. Tim Melton also happens to the be the single biggest donor of RFK Jr as well and was trying to push Trump to pick him as running mate.

The problem, as always, is that you’re stupid and can’t figure out obvious things.

>they tried to kill Trump!
It’s more likely that the shooter was allowed in with the full expectation that he would be killed before he could fire a round. So the SS conspired to let him in but failed to shoot him in time.

>Trump is beholden to Big Tech now
He announced infinity H1-B visas before the donation. Why are you surprised?

>RNC unity
It’s totally Jewish with Trump reigned in, completely co trolled by “the swamp.” His VP pick proves this, and his cabinet picks will as well.

>microsoft DEI department fired
It’s Jewish unity. The “taps sign” meme is right.

>msm said Biden is fine
That did a complete 360 on this after the debate. Then they rallied behind Trump after the shooting.

>Bibi telling his slaves how things will be
Unity.

The Jewish power structure wants Trump as President because he will support their Jewish war more than anyone else. Biden dropping out doesn’t change anything but who the designated loser is.

Oof this gotta suck, doesn't it? You completely had this one in the bag. Old Pedo Joe with a brain so mush he couldn't talk for more than 20 seconds without slipping into confused mumbling. Couldn't even recognize people he'd known for years in the end.
And now the 2020 DEI hire has invalidated every attack ad out there. Spend 4 years wearing down this senile dementia patient in the media, only for Trump to barely rise above him in the polls.
And now it was all for nothing.

Looks like you'll have to run on policy now. Which of course is a fucking disaster because no one wants Project 2025 or whatever Moldbug wrote over past two decades except for Thiel's billionaire butt buddies and pederasts like Vance. And people are kinda done with these geriatric pedos in office in general.

my friend, if that shooting could be resimulated a million times, it would never go down the way it did again. If you see the bullets trajectory, it was some real Jules Winfield shit. Dumb Dei bitches on the ground aside, that man was clearly allowed to start shooting before they actually attempted to take him down even though they had him in the crosshairs well before that. Then the director comes out and says no1 was on this roof because of a mild slope while they had a team on a roof with a steeper gradient? There's incompetency, then there's this. This was dileberate.

Kamala Harris used to slut it up with rappers in her younger years. She got her start in politics by sleeping with the former governor of California. She married a Jew and spawned offspring with him. After a failed presidential run where she received little support, she was picked as Joe Biden's VP as a DEI hire because she was a minority female. As vice president her popularity sank even further because it was obvious to everyone that she was an airheaded bimbo that had no business being vice president. Now that the brain damaged husk was forced out, she will be the nominee for president. She is unqualified. deeply unpopular, a slut and an idiot. I give her a 50/50 chance of winning.

- We have had an attempted assassination of Trump a week ago. And now it is coming out that the SS was a complete shit show. In hindsight, Trump should have been killed.

- Then we had Musk come out and donates a shit ton of money to Trump

-RNC happens and seems to be 100% unity. Trump looks like he is sad.

-Zuckerberg pretty much pulled back support for the left

- Microsoft fires it's DEI dept

- Biden now drops out of the race despite months of MSM saying everything was fine.

- Netanyahu is coming this week to speak to congress despite the fact that Biden dropped out and Trump was almost killed. Is he running the US too behind closed doors?

So it seems like Trump was supposed to die and Biden drops out. Two of the presidential nominees for the 2024 election...both to be replaced. It was obviously planned.

If we can stop with the porn posts and other garbage threads, maybe you people can put it all together and figure out what the fuck is happening. Is this total jew takeover now?

I called months ago Biden would step down, COVID aside he was just making sure his son/family got away with everything.
Harris has maybe 10% chance to be first female, via sleeping her way all the way to the top. However she was the first one out in 2020, she was a DEI ballot pick.

Most likely scenario is we get Michelle Osama binladen with borrash husband vice since they've been pulling strings and he wanted another 4 years.

Btw where are all the Bernie shills who just suddenly said ok to Biden?

possible, but it doesn't matter much. trump is gone after this term anyway, he doesn't have to care about his re-election
all he has to do is start undoing the dem faggotry. kill DEI, stop the ukraine war, gut the epa (to a reasonable extent), hopefully do something about education, tarrifs where appropriate, and ofc, stop immigration
bonus points for SC picks, if any arise.
as a 2nd term pres, he doesn't HAVE to have a great economy necessarily, tho ofc it would be good, what he has to do is build for the future.

both sides are right, but it ultimately is a demoralization attempt (pessimism is often a justification for inaction in depressive/narcissistic people). it amounts to
>if you defeat your enemies, you lose

however, there IS a correction by the "establishment" who realized the DEI filth was a dead end, and war is on the horizon, but that doesn't mean the walking back of this isn't a victory.

by trying to frame an explicit and humiliating (for the enemy) victory as a loss, that image functions as demoralization propaganda. there are different factions in everything, even at the highest levels, and the anti-white communist demon faction took a big hit. there's no better time than now to tackle issues that were forbidden before. the rhetorical, political, and social opening this huge walkback offers the Right cannot be dismissed unless you're stupid and myopic.

There's been absolutely no changes to the fundamentals and why the mainstream would start to become pro white, you kike. All with high IQ understand the lack of change in fundamentals (the kikes still hate whites and want them dead) but change in behavior (DEI attacked in media, Trump being installed again) means a psyop. They want whites to be moralized, and the most likely reason is so they are more productive for coming wars for Israel.

DNC insider here. AOC will most likely be the chosen VP for Kamala. It’s still being debated but there’s very little pushback from the party. They are tired of old white men and want to campaign on DEI and having younger candidates that will excite the younger voters.

Maximizes profit and stock value for Tinder/Bumble/Hinge/etc, as well as a host of other industries.

The problem with early and durable monogamy is that it doesn't produce as much profit as people dating. Dating means restaurants and days out while paying individual expenses, utilities, consumerism, etc. Monogamy means shared bills, shared utilities, lower consumerism, etc.

The worst part about monogamy is that men get to exert an influence on household expenses, which always reduces them. Men generally want to clamp down on spending while women want to spend. Even when monogamy was the law of the land women did the bulk of the spending. Getting women away from men and putting more money in their hands via affirmative action (now known as DEI) means more spending, which means more GDP and more taxes and more profit and higher stock value. Which are really the important things in our society.

Why are you guys getting so complacent and cocky as if Trump has locked it in? Harris will be harder to defeat than Biden. You're already seeing the headlines they're rushing out in support of her. Expect more of that to come. Now they're going to say Trump's too old, everything about Biden's age and Hunter's laptop and all the other Biden-centric controversies are out the window for the most part, now they have the DEI points (first woman pres., black woman pres., minority vote). The dems are divisive and panicking now but as long as they get it together in the next 100 days, rally behind her, and laser focus the campaign on it simply being unifying and defeating Trump rather than Harris's likability, they will have a chance.

DO NOT GET COCKY

The problem with Kamala is that while she ticks every single DEI box, brown, woman, etc, she's also retarded. In interviews when she's pressed on a question, she just laughs to try to get out of it because she is simply too dumb to come up with a rebuttal. She doesn't understand "anything". Even 2020 Biden still had somewhat of a grasp of the issues, Kamala couldn't even tell you what continent Israel is on.

She dropped out of the presidential race in 2020 because she secured 1% of the democratic vote in polling.
She was picked as VP for a token nigger DEI.
There's no americans who support her.
But democrats can't jump over her & nominate someone else because it would cause them the nigger vote
They shoehorned themselves & they have no choice.
The democrat party is currently cannibalizing itself.
That's why trump seems a lot more 'calm' & level headed in his speeches. He doesn't have to do anything to win. Just don't fuck up & stay alive.

I have a proposal, living off the land might be the best bet for most of us. Only problem is that it will be incredibly difficult to sustain that life alone and probably isolating. There’s also the upfront investment cost which is pretty steep thanks to the jews at blackrock.

So what if you and a couple of other guys went in on buying a large farm/homesteading property and forming our own enclaves of off the grid white people?

Kinda like the Benedict option for white people. If I could find a piece of off the grid land within a two hour drive of a state school to go party at on the weekends I could probably convince half a dozen guys in the same situation as me to form a sort of post college off the grid frat house. Working with the boys to build a compound sounds infinitely better to being a wageslave for Mr. Shekelberg or tax cattle so our dollars can go to Israel and replace us with non-whites. Work for yourself and not zog corporations.

If you can supply your own food, water, and security then there’s really not much else you need, right?

Let’s discuss this idea and see how it could work out.

she was literally chosen because of her race/gender. Like it was openly known that Biden was only considering non-white women for VP. This does give her an advantage; Hillary definitely got extra votes just for being a woman. And Trump was doing better with black voters than McCain or Romney did because they ran against Obama. So she will get some DEI votes, but most of the DEI voters were already voting Democrat anyway so it will only be a small benefit. She will win back some of the voters who abandoned Biden after the debate, so if you look back at the polls pre-debate it was very close with Trump having a slight edge. She's not likable, but she can use the racist/sexist card to deflect from that some.

Trump had a 90% chance against Biden. He has like a 60% chance against her. Still the favorite, but it's very close.

> propping up joe biden in 2020 when there were at least a dozen better choices
> not acting soon enough on pulling joe biden due to age
> very obviously and obnoxiously cucking to Israel, even though half of their base is on a polar opposite position

They're not high enough or on the right goods. Our tariffs on any food grow able here should be astronomical for one, not that China sends a lot of food here but they do a bit. We should also be increasing tariffs on manufactured next gen goods and stimulating the creation of factories here. Something dems tout but don't actually do and fuck up with dei. The modern factory will not employ uneducated masses. It will be a handful of tech degree level employees monitoring automated systems. Ignoring this superior model is to any nations detriment.

Things aren’t competitive because China is baiting U.S manufacturing with incentives, slave labor, and INSANE tariff reductions while the U.S is “encouraging” U.S manufacturing with restrictive regulations, complicated legal systems, and a labor environment that prioritizes DEI and inclusion rather than actual production and efficiency.

These economists can bark about “the free market” all they want, but it doesn’t work if someone isn’t playing fair. At least the Keynesians don’t *pretend* to not be subversive vampiric autocratic jews, unlike these so-called “free-market” advocates that pretend to care about freeing people from Government control but simultaneously enslaving them to another power

This is correct. We can’t find quality tech talent and have job openings for months. We get inundated with thousands of crap resumes, but they just go in the trash. HR can’t filter them fast enough.

The tech layoffs were purges of DEI shit employees. No good talent was fired.

Who doesn't know how to articulate their points so resorts to "oh it's you" and "You're nervous" I don't even know what that means.

Ingroup preferences are essential, it's why whites are on the back foot across the world.
Non-whites are garbage, they're not good workers, look at what diversity and DEI has done to pretty much every industry, it's lead to a massive competency crisis.
Consider our health service, if you've had the misfortune of attending a hospital you'll see nothing but agency doctors and nurses from abroad who are lazy and incompetent, they do not care because they do not have to. Meanwhile our graduate doctors and nurses go to Canada, Australia and UAE because the cost of living in this country is insane, there is nowhere to rent because landlords can stick 10 beds in a house and rent it out to a pack of deliveroo riders who deal drugs on their routes.

Social welfare is for disabled people and pensioners.

They still crush competitors in many markets. Not all these markets are public, many products are sold directly to cloud providers like Google, Amazon, etc.. Nobody really hears about these unless this work in a closely related field. IIRC the project I worked on had an expected revenue of ~$3 Billion USD. Not sure what the profit margins were.

Not really. DEI is knowingly giving jobs to totally unqualified minorities. H1Bs on paper are bringing in skilled foreign workers to fill labor shortfalls. The problem bring that Indians just fake their entire education and every credential, get in, and then game all further job listings to only hire more Indians. DEI is your company's willful suicide, H1Bs are hostile takeovers by a group just barely competent enough to keep the company going in a zombie state.

-300 applicants
-40% applicants were woman
-10% applicants were black
-30% hired were women

There are rules about funding a show or movie that involve the percentage of spoken likes per episode by non-white individuals. It’s how you get the extra DEI funding. Since everything these days is a remake or adaptation, you’re adapting characters that exist. The thing is, most of these properties that they are adapting have a majority, if not all of the cast, as white. The redhead characters are usually secondary or tertiary characters. Nobody wants to make the main character a different race, so the secondary and tertiary characters gets swapped.

they been using the same architecture since sandy bridge, they been compressing the chip size to cope, they where stubborn and wanted to use their own foundaries for their chips, but again they suck at engineering so they where stuck in 14nm+++++++ mean while amd was trying different architectures.More multi core threads than single,but again intel marketing and laurels. amd tried a new arch and licensed a new tech and use tmsc. and created a better ship meanwhile intel was still on the same sandy bridge shit. Amd created a better product and cheaper. Intel has been trying big core small core, but it dies in a year in 13th and 14th gen and has high tdp of 400w.

Also from Trump:
>In a recent landmark statement during an interview on the "All-In" podcast, former US President Donald Trump promised automatic Green Cards for foreign students graduating from US colleges. This potential policy shift if implemented stands to significantly impact the global education landscape, particularly for Indian students aspiring to study in the US.

Note that Trump appointed JD Vance who trump picked as VP as musk started giving million dollars, Vance who has connections to the All-in podcast, Peter Thiel, Musk, paypal "mafia" etc. after Musk promised to donate millions to his campaign

DEI screwed up Israel, screwed up the US government, screwed up the CIA, screwed up the FBI screwed up the Secret Service, screwed up movies, screwed up games, screwed up everything.
What's the point of being obsessed with niggers and feminism over sheer competence?

Jeets don't get the DEI jobs in IT. They are already disproportionately represented in IT jobs. Why would another Jeet be considered a diversity hire in a majority Jeet environment? Hiring a Nigger, Latinx or a white in IT is considered diversity hiring.

However, Fink is not realizing how much hate does his ESG system is getting from literally everyone. As soon as the increase in interest rates from the Fed began, every major company dropped their DEI bullshit and is covertly telling Fink to eat shit for forcing companies to hire incopetent NIGGERS at this point in time where they need the Whites who built the airplanes 30 years ago.

Kim Cheatle joined the United States Secret Service in 1995. She was involved in the evacuation of Vice President Dick Cheney on the September 11 attacks, and served on Joe Biden's protective detail during the Obama administration.

From 2019 to 2022, Cheatle served as senior director of global security at PepsiCo.

In 2021, Biden awarded Cheatle a Presidential Rank Award for 'exceptional performance'. In August 2022, Biden announced the appointment of Cheatle to be director of the United States Secret Service.
It was said that she was very close to Jill Biden.

May 2023, Cheatle stated the Secret Service, which had a 48% departure rate, needed to "attract diverse candidates and give opportunities to everybody in the workforce, particularly women" which is code for DEI hiring. She said she aims to have 30% women in the agency by 2030.

She defended herself by saying that local law enforcement was responsible for the building the shooter was on...which is bullshit.

What happened was dei sniper missing trump gave freedom to the other billionaires that the government harassed and attempted to kill then threatened to shut up... it gave them freedom to speak up. Elon had two Assassin attempts in last six months (he shared that this morning in live Tesla meeting along with blatantly support for trump. Hell the 1st guy that said something was bus driver dictator in South America. He was sick of the assassin attempts on his life.

Hardcore leftists still are.
But normies (people who don't pay attention, or just move with the herd) have switched sides because everyone's low key bothered by what a hoax COVID and the vax were and tired of SJWs, cringe tranny activists, and just ending up embarrassingly in the wrong on every single issue again and again.
To top it all off, they just watched the shit with Trump which was undeniably bad-ass. They see leftists and they see the people trying to ruin everything, bossing everyone around, etc etc. Then they see the right and they see absolute badasses who stand their ground and embody everything it means to be an American.

As for powerful jews, they switched sides because of the left's reaction to Oct 7.

> Did they move him to a better position to support the trajectory that he shot trump?
Good question. Shame someone can’t ask them directly about the body placement. It’s starting to feel like they expected to kill Trump, immediately pivot to start a war with Iran, then bury the assassination details under the guise of national security bypassing FOIA requests for half a century, as so many have already alluded to.

The Iran narrative is also sus. Started to surface after expert opinions from other nationalities version of Secret Service, pointed out that the shooter would have to have the assistance of some type of government in order to get into that type of position, to even have an opportunity to take a shot. The entire rollout of the attempt is a huge fiasco.

It’s comical how unofficially the blame seems to be falling towards DEI as a scapegoat. While I agree, that is certainly reasonable. It’s very suspect that several major companies have ditched DEI within a few days of this happening. Almost as this concept was groomed over the last several years for particular purpose. Or to explain a particular set of events. Maybe that’s a stretch, too far of a conspiracy.

Shots 1, 2, 3 are sniper shots. Trained ones. Trigger squeezes. The first one was supposed to be the killshot. Then crooks gets killed and they blame everything on his one shot.

The problem is that the first shot missed. So two more shots were taken, but by then trump was down and the sniper was out of that building. The fact that the second recording has no echo indicated the shots were from inside.

Then crooks shoots wildly from on top of the roof. There might be one or two of the snipers shots mixed in, but it's harder to make out now because crooks is shooting wildly and people are screaming. You can hear the sound of his shots echo off the roof, making a stronger post shot audio profile.

I think there were two shooters, a pro who missed, and crooks the set up. There was only supposed to be one shot, but the person in charge of such operation is probably DEI now, so now there's multiple shots recorded from multiple locations in video and audio, and many of them haven't even been discovered yet. People will post and find more of them on social media

So the real question is, will the Overton window shift and people realize their own government tried to kill trump? That's going to change a lot of perspectives.

It's just downstream of our desire for delegated authority, independence and meritocracy. Hand in hand with that is the idea of kinda letting people do what they want as long as it works. You can see this conflict writ large in the current DEI debate; DEI was passed in under the idea of
>we need to play fair and give them a chance to prove themselves
and now we're having a rough time because it's become obvious that they won't prove themselves, we'll just have to keep lowering the bar which offends our sense of merit. But the proper response would be to start judging based on birth which offends our sense of fair play. That's why we can't take action to resolve the situation. The only thing that wouldn't have offended any sensibility is for us to give blacks/browns a chance and for them to prove themselves. Which I'm sure some have but not the majority. Which in turn means we have to do something we don't like, which leads to denial and finger-pointing, which leads to inaction, etc etc.

And while the Romans might've written that Teutonics and Celts held their women in common esteem to make them look bad to their home audience where that was the obvious mark of barbarity, it's also possible it was just true and maybe we've always had a more elevated role for women than most other cultures. So that's another area where what we need to do is blocked by reflexive moral intuitions.

you'll plateau in skills because higher maintenance people won't get hired and you won't get their skills. so then other nations will fuck you up. if it were that easy it would have long been fixed.
>>474946760
root cause costs money, they wanna fix it for free. basically they want workforce to settle for less, that's what it's all about. hence immigrants on the other side of the isle.
what do you think the whole DEI no muh racism allowed is all about? making it possible so they milk the ones settling for basically nothing.
DEI is telling white folk "listen, we'll legally punish you if you don't make room for these people working for cheap, you ask for too much so you'll make room for them. or else". this shit happening in my country as well as of lately, because it helps the economy, they work for real cheap, and laws are given to allow them to work for cheap, as in social inclusion and all that.
it's always about money and power, nothing else. they just packaged it with morals

This doesn't matter once you let these locusts into management. They hire enough indians that indian sentiment spreads, and soon some retarded blonde woman CEO who is all about DEI but is secretly racist enough to think "all indians are good at tech" and "all asians are good at math" hires one on as CTO. Then she gets fired, and they hire one as CEO. At this point, the company becomes a poohost, driven entirely by the intellect of its white base while disgusting streetshitters steal the work product and pass it off as their own.

Roman Catholic myths.
>the Obelisk
Of course you guys get hung up on the Obelisks instead of the city divided in three parts, this is because you don't read or understand prophecy. Believe it or not, I know that there are more obelisks on earth than these three.
Also the one in London is not akshuallly in the City of London you know. This is the kind of gotchas that Romans throw at this. Not understanding the actual point at all. No wonder you guys are Roman Catholics and defend this institution blindly. You have this man's name (vicarivs filii dei) and the Roman numbers of his name on your forehead (your mind), and you act upon that with your right hand.

>>474935096
You either don't understand prophecy or you don't even read it. I guess the latter since Romans don't read the Bible.
Prophecy is fulfilled in history. It is not a Roman Catholic Futurist sensationalist speculation that never comes to pass and can never increase faith. They invented all this modern interpretations of Revelation to protect the Roman church, and all Protestant churches today are basically the daughters of that mother of harlots.
Most Protestants don't know what the Reformation was even about, and they don't know how many of their doctrines are counter-reformation schemes from the Vatican and their Jesuit agents.

The first three shots have no echo and are from inside the building through a window. This was the actual sniper. Crooks was just the cover, and was probably lured into his job as bait and told to fire if he was fired at. He heard the first three shots (oh no, the SS is shooting at me) and fired 5 shots of a clearly different caliber, with a sixth shot possiblely from him or another gun. The audio signatures for the first three and succeeding six shots are markedly different in volume and quality. The first three are someone squeezing off a trigger like a sniper. The shots after are frenzied, rushed shots.

The deep state tried to assassinate trump, but they picked a DEI sniper.

The audio difference is so clear, anyone can tell.

You have to understand American leftists to understand this.
It's an entire cult/industry based on identifying some bullshit Original Sin and using that to leverage the guilt of inferior people getting into makework positions.
Feminism comes from this, BLM came from this, le colonialism came from this, slavery that africans did to themselves and plenty of countries in history did became america's original sin even though whites died to stop slavery, making them the first race to oppose it wholesale.

Consider that pioneers in america used to be respected, as americans came from minority underdogs themselves facing religious persecution in England to settle America, while being scalped and attacked by natives in the few places they even encountered them while dealing with the hardships of utter wilderness.

Fastforward to 2024 and losers and Berkleyite types that never did a day of real work in their lives use these shaming techniques to cancel others, justify drug addict behavior like George Floyd's that got him killed of a fentanyl overdose, pedos marching and burning down towns in Kenosha, "SUV murders" like Wakuesha etc.

The first approach they started with was recruiting women to the Cult of Loser that is the American Left.
In the 60s and 70s they did it again with communism and Jim Jones.

Now they put people in corporations for DEI/ESG and makework positions, and women are told they are the greatest species on the planet that can do no wrong ever.
Leftism is a quasi religious cult, and women are easily recruited into it as they're most susceptible to digital peer pressure. Get even two men together (men, not leftist cuckolds) that say otherwise and women are quickly swayed under different leadership IRL.

that's also what I have been thinking while watching what is going on in the U.S. The Japanese institutions started opening Diversity, Equity and Inclusion offices in major institutions in around 2017-ish. So it's now getting ramped up and firmly in place. But maybe by the time it really starts to gain strong momentum here, it will be already on the decline in the U.S. But a part of me thinks that maybe not. Because the Japanese government has been cutting deals with Black Rock and jew finance. And jews demand that DEI be in place - e.g. Larry Fink's statements on DEI is "now just a fact of life if anyone wants our money."

It is perfectly fine to think that.
>DEI
jews and their tikkun olam has enraptured the so called politicians. And they made that ideology pervasive over 100 years. a country headed by jews does not stand for very long, they have now a perverse idealogy that aligns with the technocratic futurists of the 20th century and long has. They are fitting like a puzzle piece right into the fabric of governance. Which is compelling!
BUT, the fruits of which have not been made manifest they will say.
I am getting into the weeds without citation, but I hope the message is resounding.

One of my Econ credits in college was from a DEI course that taught that Africans invented capitalism and also Hellenistic Greece.

Or final paper was on why the transatlantic slave trade was bad and it’s wrong to enslave people based on race, so I wrote about how it wasn’t racist and the jews did it.

It's Roman Catholic, not Christian Catholic. Huge difference. Rome is a part of human government, they want man to rule, not God, hence why they put a man as a divine figure to worship, and manmade doctrines and traditions above the word of God. And the Roman number of this man (vicarivs filii dei) adds up to 666. In the Bible Roman Catholicism is the whore of Babylon, and truly every unclean thing in the world leads back to Rome, you wouldn't believe how many Roman concept are in the world that people blindly believe and don't know that it came from the Vatican or its Jesuit agents. This entire globohomo system is in fact Babylon, which is destined for destruction according to the word of God.

Don’t listen to this guy, I’m the real insider. Basically everything is fake until proven gay. Biden was not “flipped”. He was rotated on his y axis, okay? Listen…there’s a big octopus with different tentacles. One tentacle represents dedicated Zionists. Another tentacle represents the international banking cartel. Another tentacle represents communist/atheist ideologues. The communist/atheist ideologues still want to promote globohomo ideology in the west but it’s failing and the west is facing a serious crisis of competence and social cohesion. The international banking cartel will just side with whoever enables them to maintain power. So because the DEI experiment is failing, they’ve decided to side with the Zionists. Thus the ruling class actually wants Trump in office to bolster their military numbers and get people back into the system, but the communist/atheist ideologues don’t want to drop their failed experiment so they’re still promoting the “Trump is Hitler and he’s going to put all the gays in concentration camps when he implements project 25” narrative…basically the Jews are infighting.

So they're not actually upset about affirmative action per se, they're upset that they're not benefitting from it.

You're an idiot, a retarded nerd, a small person, with no solutions. But you might also be a foreign national, or a CIA operative (literally just sitting in an office, nothing crazy or sensational,) or maybe you're a Fed government hopeful.

We know you're out there. You're a Fed government loyalist. Commie, Marxist. We have names for you.

You are the Fascists.

You are the ones who employed Corporations, teamed up with their government Cohorts, to control the population. You tried, you tried really hard.

There's room for you here, but your influence will get smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller like the nerds you are. You will never be in charge. You will never have power. Say this to your superior.

I hate using the term, because it's overused and the original article was written by one of those "no one wants to work anymore" boomers, but this is just a checkpoint along the trail of decline known as the competency crisis. DEI hires and mass outsourcing of labor to retard countries.
This is the inflection point. Covid gave them the excuse to fire who they wanted, and the remote revolution made it easier to outsource more jobs to shitholes like India. They see all these companies as no longer capable of growth, and they are reaping them all through these "profit driven" practices. They are squirreling away all these resources for the long winter to come. They will be despots in a spoiled world. Just as their book demands.

CrowdStrike was a major player in the Russia, Russia, Russia scam by falsifying logs that the DNC servers were hacked by Russia. It was proven by multiple independent computer security researchers that the logs were very obviously falsified (by DEI hires probably). These logs were the whole premise for the entire Russia scam against Trump.

Their CEO and board all heavily donated to Shillary's PACs in 2016 and Biden's in 2020. Some people even suspect that CrowdStrike is nothing more than a CIA and deep state front company.

Today just proved how much influence CrowdStrike has on America's infrastructure because it's EVERYWHERE. This CIA front company could shut down our infrastructure with the push of a button (like the push of this "faulty" driver) and then blame it on state-level hackers. Perhaps this was even a mistaken test run for a similar scenario during Trump's presidency.

which is also a downlevel consequence of DEI. See what happens is they think they can wiggle around the DEI stipulations by hiring brown people. They need to be able to take a photo of the team and pass it up through the chain to management in a series of chain emails. The further up the chain it goes, staff will increasingly close the email upon seeing large areas of brown on the screen and simply reply "good" in shock to avoid having some kind of jeet induced seizure. So yeah.

it's not DEI, it's outsourcing/jeets.

You have to understand that jeets are like an entirely different species than whites and their thought process regarding technical things is bizzare, almost alien.

To a jeet YOU are the retard if you try to understand a system and elaborately design a system before implementation. That's simply not how things are done sir. To a pajeet programming is about copying and pasting from the code base (or even stack overflow) and just tweaking/brute forcing things until it works in some limited special case, then they push it to prod and call it a day.

Jeets culturally/genetically don't see any value in understanding things. They don't want to know how/why anything works and will actually think you're insane if you do understand something, because that's not the point.

No matter how incompetent you think pajeets are, you're overestimating them.

Guy in the twitter thread is a moron, there is no reason to write kernel drivers in Rust. At that level you are going to be doing a lot of "unsafe" programming with pointer arithmetic no matter what, particularly to interact with volatile registers etc. It's a "system programming language" built around memory safety, where you discard all of the memory safety features of the language to do any actual system programming. The entire purpose of Rust is defeated by programming something that actually fucking matters. It's a baby gloves language for DEI and offshore hires to stop them fucking it all up.

Linux is also better here - to the point it already is the dominant OS for these.

Nothing is actually done about illegals however, and the media continue to dominate as before, just more cautiously to not antagonize Trump too much. They will continue to normalize anti-Racism and anti-whiteness, even as DEI declines due to the systemic collapse it causes.

Think about it, who is the biggest rival of the boomer top dog who refuses to retire or ever admit he's wrong?

Young White men.

None of these corporations actually like hiring women or jeets, DEI is a method for management and corporate boards to consolidate power.

Yes, when reboots cost money, even though a compromise is infinitely more expensive, some places will not do it. It's not the tech people making the decisions then. Banks, credit unions, they can't just reboot a core. Sometimes the whole rest of the system has to be done afterwards to sync back up too. You're not thinking like a dei board exec.

that isn't how DEI works. it's a protection racket to put unqualified nigs into cushy make-work white-collar office positions at large profitable companies. "outreach coordinator for community engagement" and useless shit like that. it's the same scam that Rainbow-PUSH has been running for 50 years. affirmative action schemes are a parasite that attaches itself to a host to feed. they don't actually run shit (unless it is a university).
however, the skilled labor out on the line are still the same guys.

Last year Russia assembled 600k cars. Germany assembled 3.6 million cars.
Last year Russia assembled 12 aeroplanes. Maybe one large ship(?) and dozen of boats

South Korea produces more ships than Russia! Both Boeing and Airbus produce more planes than Russia per year.

Furthermore Russia has no domestic software, no hardware and no electronics!

The cars and planes Russia assembles are dependent on chinese !!!!! parts
Russia is not exporter and is not independent.
It is, and since fall of USSR, has been dependent on imports

This chart doesn't disprove anything. I'm a tranny that voted and for a third time will vote Trump because Liberals don't treat me like an actual person. They fail to see how dehumanizing it is for me to have so much to my work ethic, attitude, and generally pretty calming presence. Like I'm the person trying to calm people down at work when they have bad days, talking to them about their gripes, training them on niche information on how to run the equipment that only me and maybe like 6 other people in the entire 250 employee plant knew how to do a year ago.
I had all of this taken away from me more or less when my employer decided to, against my wishes, make me legally changing my name a big deal. I went from being the quirky spastic that leads the cleaning team well, I still have emails praising our speed increase, minimalization of misses, and general increased teamwork as a unit. That used to define me, a great worker.
Now I'm just the sani-tranny because liberal retards think that alone is the most important element about me. I'm not a person to them, I'm a thing. It's so much more upsetting than "Yeah sorry but I don't believe in tranny shit and will still deadname you." I don't complain at being deadnamed, I've worked there 4 years with that name. DEI team however thinks everyone can reprogram in a fucking week and gets mad when they don't.

Not that guy, but a former research chemist here
1. Smokeless powder is mostly Nitrocellulose. You can refine cellulose from most plant matter using the kraft pulp process, but cotton has high enough levels to just work. Then you have to nitrate it, basically bond it with nitric groups from nitric acid. It's honestly too much work for a one man operation. You would have an easier time getting a black powder compatible cartridge like .45-70 and just running off black powder.

2. None of my bosses were Jewish, Taiwanese and eastern euro mostly. I wouldn't be suprised if there were jews at the top though I didn't know any personally
3. That guy probably hasn't. The world still needs chemicals, grannies more than anyone. I did leave the industry due to DEI bullshit though. I was the only American on a team of 7 stationed in Massachusetts.

Check out the fitness requirements for the Secret Service:
https://www.secretservice.gov/careers/technical-law-enforcement/fitness-standards

Lower for women, obviously.
What is that, if not DEI?
Lower in fitness, height, stature reflexes, willingness to put themselves in harm's way for their client (and differing "reasoning"/cognitive skills, or lack thereof) means the protectee is significantly less protected with women in their protection detail.

If it were simply incompetence we would have 36 dead politicians this election cycle. Everyone would be shooting politicans instead of voting. If it were simple dei incompetence we wouldnt have politicians at all. Theyd all been shot from much further away from a better concealed position. You couldnt even get close enough for a shot without the whole police force and feds ignoring you.
