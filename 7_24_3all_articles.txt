the water tower is a big blue herring
the real culprit is likely DEI in the end.
they've been sniffing their own farts for so long they thought women and niggers could do the job of men.
even if there was a conspiracy in the gov't to assassinate Trump, and I would not be shocked to find that out, the reason they failed was also DEI.
should have hired a non schizo jew White human shooter and back up shooters if that's the theory.

So it turns out that Crooks really was a patsy, and the real shooter was a CIA sniper in the watertower. However, the CIA's DEI program required all off the books black units to have proportional representation, so the sniper was a morbidly obese black lesbian who had never fired a rifle before 3 weeks ago.

It's Roman Catholic, not Christian Catholic. Huge difference. Rome is a part of human government, they want man to rule, not God, hence why they put a man as a divine figure to worship, and manmade doctrines and traditions above the word of God. And the Roman number of this man (vicarivs filii dei) adds up to 666. In the Bible Roman Catholicism is the whore of Babylon, and truly every unclean thing in the world leads back to Rome, you wouldn't believe how many Roman concept are in the world that people blindly believe and don't know that it came from the Vatican or its Jesuit agents. This entire globohomo system is in fact Babylon, which is destined for destruction according to the word of God.

Don’t listen to this guy, I’m the real insider. Basically everything is fake until proven gay. Biden was not “flipped”. He was rotated on his y axis, okay? Listen…there’s a big octopus with different tentacles. One tentacle represents dedicated Zionists. Another tentacle represents the international banking cartel. Another tentacle represents communist/atheist ideologues. The communist/atheist ideologues still want to promote globohomo ideology in the west but it’s failing and the west is facing a serious crisis of competence and social cohesion. The international banking cartel will just side with whoever enables them to maintain power. So because the DEI experiment is failing, they’ve decided to side with the Zionists. Thus the ruling class actually wants Trump in office to bolster their military numbers and get people back into the system, but the communist/atheist ideologues don’t want to drop their failed experiment so they’re still promoting the “Trump is Hitler and he’s going to put all the gays in concentration camps when he implements project 25” narrative…basically the Jews are infighting.

So they're not actually upset about affirmative action per se, they're upset that they're not benefitting from it.

CrowdStrike was a major player in the Russia, Russia, Russia scam by falsifying logs that the DNC servers were hacked by Russia. It was proven by multiple independent computer security researchers that the logs were very obviously falsified (by DEI hires probably). These logs were the whole premise for the entire Russia scam against Trump.

Their CEO and board all heavily donated to Shillary's PACs in 2016 and Biden's in 2020. Some people even suspect that CrowdStrike is nothing more than a CIA and deep state front company.

Today just proved how much influence CrowdStrike has on America's infrastructure because it's EVERYWHERE. This CIA front company could shut down our infrastructure with the push of a button (like the push of this "faulty" driver) and then blame it on state-level hackers. Perhaps this was even a mistaken test run for a similar scenario during Trump's presidency.

Why can't I marry someone that has the same interests and beliefs as me just because she's not white?

I would make her children whiter, and we'd both be happy.

If everyone race-mixed, there would be no more DEI or libshit either.

If you ask me, it seems like race-mixing is good for America.

>it's not DEI, it's outsourcing/jeets
which is also a downlevel consequence of DEI. See what happens is they think they can wiggle around the DEI stipulations by hiring brown people. They need to be able to take a photo of the team and pass it up through the chain to management in a series of chain emails. The further up the chain it goes, staff will increasingly close the email upon seeing large areas of brown on the screen and simply reply "good" in shock to avoid having some kind of jeet induced seizure. So yeah.

it's not DEI, it's outsourcing/jeets.

You have to understand that jeets are like an entirely different species than whites and their thought process regarding technical things is bizzare, almost alien.

To a jeet YOU are the retard if you try to understand a system and elaborately design a system before implementation. That's simply not how things are done sir. To a pajeet programming is about copying and pasting from the code base (or even stack overflow) and just tweaking/brute forcing things until it works in some limited special case, then they push it to prod and call it a day.

Jeets culturally/genetically don't see any value in understanding things. They don't want to know how/why anything works and will actually think you're insane if you do understand something, because that's not the point.

No matter how incompetent you think pajeets are, you're overestimating them.

Guy in the twitter thread is a moron, there is no reason to write kernel drivers in Rust. At that level you are going to be doing a lot of "unsafe" programming with pointer arithmetic no matter what, particularly to interact with volatile registers etc. It's a "system programming language" built around memory safety, where you discard all of the memory safety features of the language to do any actual system programming. The entire purpose of Rust is defeated by programming something that actually fucking matters. It's a baby gloves language for DEI and offshore hires to stop them fucking it all up.

Aka browse the web and send one email a week. Can easily be done on Linux, the system will be overall faster and more reliable. Typing into spreadsheets and pretending to do something falls in this category btw.
>High level technical, like coding
Consistently better on Linux, not a single coder out there likes Windows.

Linux is also better here - to the point it already is the dominant OS for these.

What says "New Age" more than an American success story where a winner falls from grace yet still rises through all hardship just to curbstomp some stupid, uppity DEI hire nigress mercilessly for leadership? Remember, Kamala wasn't chosen because she was second best or anything. She was chosen because she was a black female that couldn't even outshine JOE FUCKING BIDEN. She is quite literally in that position for Biden to say he isn't racist and for ideological nitwits salivating over "I need an exotic person in this role now" to vote blindly.

Palestinian genocide proceeds to its natural conclusion.
International influence and prestige keeps collapsing at the same rate, even though Trump will actually put effort into that; Biden was a natural.
Immigration is "restriced", which will be a cope. So instead of a million per month it's limited to a mere 300.000, goy!
Nothing is actually done about illegals however, and the media continue to dominate as before, just more cautiously to not antagonize Trump too much. They will continue to normalize anti-Racism and anti-whiteness, even as DEI declines due to the systemic collapse it causes.
No damage will be repaired, nothing will be fixed or reworked. At best you momentarily arrest on the slipper slope, a brief moment where the descent is less steep, before going into near-freefall.

This chart doesn't disprove anything. I'm a tranny that voted and for a third time will vote Trump because Liberals don't treat me like an actual person. They fail to see how dehumanizing it is for me to have so much to my work ethic, attitude, and generally pretty calming presence. Like I'm the person trying to calm people down at work when they have bad days, talking to them about their gripes, training them on niche information on how to run the equipment that only me and maybe like 6 other people in the entire 250 employee plant knew how to do a year ago.
I had all of this taken away from me more or less when my employer decided to, against my wishes, make me legally changing my name a big deal. I went from being the quirky spastic that leads the cleaning team well, I still have emails praising our speed increase, minimalization of misses, and general increased teamwork as a unit. That used to define me, a great worker.
Now I'm just the sani-tranny because liberal retards think that alone is the most important element about me. I'm not a person to them, I'm a thing. It's so much more upsetting than "Yeah sorry but I don't believe in tranny shit and will still deadname you." I don't complain at being deadnamed, I've worked there 4 years with that name. DEI team however thinks everyone can reprogram in a fucking week and gets mad when they don't.

Not that guy, but a former research chemist here
1. Smokeless powder is mostly Nitrocellulose. You can refine cellulose from most plant matter using the kraft pulp process, but cotton has high enough levels to just work. Then you have to nitrate it, basically bond it with nitric groups from nitric acid. It's honestly too much work for a one man operation. You would have an easier time getting a black powder compatible cartridge like .45-70 and just running off black powder.

2. None of my bosses were Jewish, Taiwanese and eastern euro mostly. I wouldn't be suprised if there were jews at the top though I didn't know any personally
3. That guy probably hasn't. The world still needs chemicals, grannies more than anyone. I did leave the industry due to DEI bullshit though. I was the only American on a team of 7 stationed in Massachusetts.

Lower for women, obviously.
What is that, if not DEI?
Lower in fitness, height, stature reflexes, willingness to put themselves in harm's way for their client (and differing "reasoning"/cognitive skills, or lack thereof) means the protectee is significantly less protected with women in their protection detail.

Where I work, our company is smart enough to be set up to run on hand-written EVERYTHING in situations like these, and anything that runs a machine runs on software that will never be updated without cause. Literally just pull out a piece of paper with instructions on how to record and process EVERYTHING by hand. Production schedules, sales, inventory, etc. The whole thing. Is it slower? Hell yes, but the difference between doing things slower and not being able to operate at all is staggering.
There are thousands of businesses that have been losing thousands of dollars per minute this morning over this. Honestly? Fuck them, they did it to themselves.

I guarantee that the root cause was a single person coding error from either discount brown hands coding or a DEI hire, a shitastic manager who has corner-cut the workflow or allowed his employees to corner-cut so badly they don't QA these catastrophic errors (the update fucked the bootloader so computers are basically bricked as they can't boot), and corporation greed that got them to this.

Lanza, Roof, Klebold, and Stair were the only interesting cases. Their handlers were all direct reports to the same guy that did Heavens Gate which was a scam to give the Feds back doors into private businesses tech.
>Lanza
Is literally Applewhites clone taken from his discarded testicles. I’m not joking. His terminal cancer diagnosis was already known and they were looking for continuity. Lanza is the cult equivalent of Terry McGinnis. The same guy that did it made a fortune cloning racing and show camels in the UAE.
>Roof
Roof was the problem child. He checked the most boxes to try to redo the whole cult schtick but the model was dead so when they retired the boomer from Heavens Gate they just gave him the Eric Harris treatment.
>Klebold
Columbine really marked the changing in the guard. Klebold was supposed to be the next leader and Harris was supposed to be his right hand enforcer. They had to adjust to the new model and they used them to set the profile for the mass shooter op.
>Stair
Was literally a case of a woman DEI hire rehashing the same tired shit a man did successfully a long time ago and hasn’t worked in 30 years. The Kathleen Kennedy equivalent of a handler. All he was able to muster was a few friends to make a Danny Phantom fan fic. Bitch would NOT shut the fuck up about internet nativity and neuroplasticity among teens. Like yeah bitch we fucking get it you read Jung once. Fucking failure of course. Kids these days just aren’t as easy to brain wash into tasks more complex than the Harris model because the model itself is kind of self defeating and so high profile.

The rest were Feds trying to groom honeypot schemes for extremists that washed out. The retards just can’t find enough people willing to basically act the same role for 5 years, fake a prison sentence, and then go live in witness protection on below average income in buttfuck nowhere North Dakota for the rest of their lives.

Or low IQ sheboon believing she's entitled to be a commercial pilot despite being a less skilled pilot. When she actually gets the job because of DEI standards, she is effectively pushing another person off of their deserved "place on the bench".

The pope however does claim to be a divine figure in the position of Christ, and the Roman number of his name (vicarivs filii dei) comes together as 666, many other names and titles as well. Some popes in history even claimed to be Jesus reincarnated. Their audacity is beyond belief.
The Bible isn't talking about a business man in the 21st century, it talks about ecclesiastical things. And the Roman Catholic church is by far the most powerful institution in the world and has by far the dirtiest bloodiest hands throughout all of history. Pagan Rome killed millions of Christians, Papal Rome killed tens of millions of Christians, only to prevent the word of God being translated. But they couldn't stop it so they eventually had to change tactics and started their counter-reformation schemes, which most Christians now believe in.THE Antichrist™ is such a concept, invented by Jesuit Francisco Ribera to protect the Roman church, it's an endless sensationalist speculation, those kind of interpretations never come to pass and can never increase faith in Christ. They invented all sorts of nonsense and Protestants don't even know what the Reformation fathers knew and understood about prophecy at the time. The one uniting doctrine of all Refomation was that the Roman church is the whore of Babylon. And today hundreds of millions of people exalt this pope man as a divine figure.
The Reformation was prophesied in Revelation 10, and today we are around chapter 18 in the modern world.

>Eventually things will have to change
I don't think they can fix it. Right now the central planners have raised the interest rates and forced companies to slightly adhere more to reality and that is resulting in layoffs, scrutiny of DEI initiatives and departments and so on. But don't forget that middle management at these companies is infested DEI that will be serving their own interests. That's why the termites or pests analogy fits, it's not just parasites destroying something someone else built, but their will be a reaction to trying to drive them out. They will hide. In the case of cockroaches they can build up resistance to pesticide and so on.

Linux is made by autists, for autists. But I think we've already past a tipping point where some autist Finnish guy's OS is starting to look better than Windows on account of the fact that despite all its flaws it's more stable than the big ball of cow dung that Windows is becoming. I hope they turn things around, I really do. But there is a point of no return. Like when you use 51% fuel. It feels like we've past that point already, but the fact there's a lot of fuel in the tank is perhaps misleading (and making people think things are fixable).

>>474811986
Valve got quite concerned with Microsoft "Windows store" being more integrated into the OS like an App Store because it meant that Microsoft would be able to sell games directly to normies and was built in to the OS. Not to mention, Microsoft takes like a 20% cut on anything sold on that store, including in app purchases (so trying to make money via game sales in Steam is impossible for Valve). In the past several years they've invested heavily in making sure lots of popular games on Steam run on Linux. I was able to play Halo Infinite there the other day just fine. And that wasn't even specifically for Windows, Valve is using a thing called "proton" which isn't an emulator, it's just converting things like the DirectX call to the equivalent OpenGl).

pastafag is generally right
I'm in a manufacturing industry running capital engineering projects and I see exactly the same thing. Company refuses to hire capable engineering talent because DEI means they only allow women and niggers through the door both of whom can't engineer their way out of a paper bag or even set up a financially viable capital project, much less execute it. I'm working 12-14 hours days doing capital project work because the company has let go of actual experienced white talent. (((They))) let them walk out and now the c-suit (((faggots))) are wondering why everyone is under spending on capital screaming "we must spend and invest!". So (((they))) are throwing money at every opportunity, but there is NO ONE available to actually execute. Turns out that once there is no one talented available to make something happen it doesn't matter how much money you throw at a problem.

You guys have no idea how fucking worse things are going to get
This shit starts way back, around 2010 or earlier
Before then, big tech was a haven for white nerds. If you wanted to do awesome shit with the best gear available and surrounded by smart people, it was the place to go.
Awesome shit was made. Gmaps was literal magic at the time. Some things that were thought as technically impossible became reality in years.
Then suits moved in. The smart ones understood what was going to happen immediately. A good portion just left with the coffers and started their own startup - only to be bought back again (the big "acquihire" wave of the mid 2010). Most retired after that.
Smart whites started doing shit like working at google for 3-4 years, living in a van outside in the parking lot, and saving literal millions in order to retire right after that. I personally know one that did, he's now chilling in costa rica, never to work again.
This was all before the DEI holocaust. That started around 2016. By that time, everyone was already bleeding talent profusely with no end in sight.
DEI was the death sentence for everything even remotely related to R&D at those companies. They now barely manage to keep the things that were made by white engineers decades ago. AWS, google cloud, azure are all kept running by a handful of white engineers in their 50s. They cover those guys in gold so they don't leave (I know none personally but I heard stories of comps of over 10$Mil a year).
But at some point they will. There is no replacement, and there's no way to train replacements as all talent is long gone. Most core tech at those companies is treated as magic black boxes, nobody dares to touch it.

>at least its not a man masquerading as woman
Well shes at least got that. She is married with children, so she did her duty there.

She did command a combat unit, but I have no idea whether they saw combat under her. I am doubtful she was personally involved.

Alot of the senior ranks for officers are really drawn from MBAs, because thats really what they do. They are more like CEOs then field officers, and mostly what they do is keep the ships in "paint and powder". that she did a materials engineering degree is also good, it shows she has brains. Its all logistics with the brass.

Im disappointed with her appointment. I think its just Trudeau virtue signalling again, and if its not, then its even sadder for her, because it looks that way. Thats the problem with DEI, the competent women and minorities are still under a cloud, because no one is sure if they got thier position on merit.

We'll see how she does. After reading her bio, I am not enthusiastic, but its not all bad. Shes an engineer, thats good. Shes an MBA, thats good too. Right now our armed forces are completely in disarray, the liberals gutted the budget, stole all the money. Good luck to her, shes gonna need it.

that's a massive pain in the ass especially on remote or WFH systems protected by bitlocker, which they likely are because Crowdstrike is security software for security minded companies. Plus imagining trying to get your average diverse zoomer end user to do those steps remotely even if you provided the bitlocker key. Hell even getting into safe mode is a pain these days and I believe it would ask for a local admin password to enter, unless you used an external boot USB. which many companies lock down in the BIOS as well. While all this COULD be mitigated if the IT engineers were white men and planned ahead, a lot of IT systems are just coasting from previous years of white design and recovery plans for this type of incident were never considered.

IT is a hellscape these days thanks to all the jeetware, I spend most my working hours screaming about jeets and monkeys and DEI as a white senior sysadmin constantly expected to work miracles to keep everything up and running smoothly in the face of software written and supported by people who shit in the street.

Both parties need to realize that flat out forgiveness or raising taxes on the wrong social hierarchy is a net negative our economy. Money comes from somewhere, don't completely forgive the loan. But also, people need to be able to pay the loan, so stop making incentives to pay them off early by working a in demand job impossible.
You want student loans to stop mooning, you need to make them illegal on the private side, and sustainable on the government side. Private student loans need to be illegal unless a family makes a certain amount, poor people should not be able to take out 100k in student loans in a study that won't even get them a job that makes over 100k to begin with.
Stop giving out free loans to people who are studying psychology, and lean them towards STEM and then STOP coincidentally outsourcing those jobs to foreigners and DEI for a lower wage.. We've gotten so used to "get a job as -insert decent wage job- it makes so much money," then getting replaced by DEI initiatives and cheaper alternatives. Also, stop making it harder for families that have reached the threshold of not being in poverty to make it in life in the U.S.

SS should NOT be able to cover up crimes. They should be required to report it or stop it.

SS needs a complete tear down and rebuilt from the ground up. The Trump shooting makes this clear. I don't know why Trump used his own private security in 2016 but was using the DEI SS for this run.

Imagine someone with a spine in charge somewhere that says things like
"No."
"Try it."
or
"Fuck off."
Whenever someone tries to force stupid shit onto society by using cops as enforcers. Unheard of. Gotta save that monthly paycheck by betraying the country, endangering the future and ruining the lives of many true nationals, including by getting some of them killed with the consequences of brown waves where they don't belong.
They know why they need things like "equity" and "DEI": Because the subhumans don't deserve any of the good treatment, as they did nothing to actually earn it.

1)
I'm pretty sure this wasn't a falseflag and trumps life was unironically in danger.
its basically confirmed that actual real bullets were fired and missed trump by mere inches,
by cameras getting the bullets as stripes,
by the impact sites in various objects behind the stage including some hydraulic bullshit
by some guys head that was on the stands behind trump going plop infront of a crowd of thousands of witnesses.
by video footage that clearly shows Trump did not have a bloodpack in his hand or some conspiracy shit when he first reached for his ear
While Trump is certainly the answer of "cui bono", I'm pretty sure thats basically just a lucky coincidence for him and someone actually unironically tried to kill him that day
2)
BUT
I also think this was some deep state conspiracy shit and the CIA or something wanted Trump dead.
Maybe its because I've watched to many spy movies n shit like that, but I unironically think if the "deep state" wanted Trump dead at all cost, they wouldn't do flawed shit like this.
They wouldn't psyop some retard into making an attempt thats most likely to fail.
They wouldn't involve so many random policemen and SS agents who'd be told to ignore an obvious thread on the roof literally minutes before the shooting
They'd literally blow up his private jet mid air, and claim it was a critical engine failure or some shit.

So basically,
As someone who's usually highly critical of the media and the mainstream narrative, I unironically think the official story is probably pretty close to the truth, that some schizo /x/-tier lunatic tried to kill trump for schizo tier reasons, and the SS is just highly incompetent because DEI also affects government agencies.
basically the standart "incompetency-crisis" in the west, because people think staffing important roles with niggers, pajeets, and women is a great idea for diversity's sake.

The truth is they don’t want plimpf dead and if they were going to take him out they would use the heart attack gun or poison his McDonald’s. successfully JFKing him with a rifle while a little demoralizing in the short run would be too risky and make him even more a hero. The incel acted alone and the secret service is just a DEI ridden failure. This wasn’t in the script, if it was they would have used a nigger or spic as the patsy not some ugly white kid.

DEI/education equity was the excuse given for discontinuing them but GATE research thread Lore(tm) is that they were discontinued because the GATE program was specifically for millennials who would be coming of age when a planned societal disruption was going to occur in the 2020s, and the program was meant to find starseeds or atypical individuals to assume positions of authority (or, alternately, find individuals who might threaten the plan and neutralize the threat)

This is her best chance though. She has NO future at this point. She is the Vice President of the Inflation and illegals President who got involved in two useless wars and cost America lives domestically and overseas all within a single term. She's the VP of the president currently undergoing elder abuse due to his cognitive decline and his team telling him everything's fine and she went along with it. She wasn't even qualified to BE his VP since she was simply selected because the aging, mentally declining president slipped up on a DEI question in the primaries and was locked in to selecting a black, female VP (and even then she's not fully black).

She will have nothing but baggage if she runs and will forever be associated with Biden and establishment Democrats which the party is going progressive and farther left. If she doesn't get her chance now, she never will.

fishy
my guess is money laundering
a company buys a bunch of tickets for a movie that, for one reason or another, must be successful (remember empty theaters for cap marvel and black panther?) and then the production company pays back somehow, either to producers with financial stakes or production costs going back to that company somehow (like a dei charity buying tickets because the movie celebrates diversity, surprise surprise it made so much money, now the production company pays that charity for consultations on future dei)
something like fandango is an intermediary, and would likely get a "cut" somehow
perhaps he got in the way of this scheme, or wanted more, tried using the knowledge of this scheme as blackmail, got to big for his britches

reality check, in addition to picrel, nearly all of USSR's top generals during WW2 were ethnically Russian, while Stalin was Georgian.

Russia has a HUGE history of military experience and culture, it's a people that were forged by war itself. Many times more military history than USA's history of statehood. What makes you think USA/NATO with their libtard DEI nonsense have any chance of beating Russia in Ukraine? Not even Hitler's highly masculine and organized force was able to do shit against Russia.
All Russia needs to do is just copy-pasta the strategies from WW2, and it already did that with the Surovikin line in 2023, by repeating the Battle of Kursk from 1943.

Bush then, I speedread a bit desu. Though I'm trying to understand why Trump dying would cause the stock to short out and depreciate in value. Were they just hoping for general instability on the market to make it go down?
Also just thinking aloud again. How does this play into the RNC? Assuming they knew how it was going to go down (Trump dead), was the whole thing a setup to get Vance or another plant into the candidate position (not for the 2024 election, as if Trump were dead, Biden would likely win) mostly for later elections to re-solidify the uni-party for all the lemmings and maga/miga-tards. All the bullshit at the RNC (republicans are the REAL DEI, jewish boybands, literal porn whores, faggots and trannies on stage, neocons calling for war with iran and cock-gagging for israel, etc) could have been set up as a massive, final initiation/humiliation ritual.

You're not wrong, unfortunately. Trump has been very complicit with the financial enslavement and demographic eradication of the european peoples, as all our politicians are. Though it's at the very least interesting how much the established elites seem to hate him, seemingly even going as far as to attempt an assassination. Personally I'm not fully decided on whether Trump's rift with the elite is just a divide and conquer act to appease us plebs, or rather they see him as a dangerous upstart who may try to usurp their ruling class in favor of his own family/dynasty. Currently leaning towards the latter, though I won't count the former out entirely. Either way, we're still fucked, as Trump becoming President, or even fucking God-Emperor of America seems to do nothing to stop fiat enslavement or replacement of european ethnicity, as seen in 2016.

1. DEI. Ethnic minorities and women are going to get pushed to the front of the queue.

2. Zoomer and millennial women have graduated from university at much higher rates. Hence, more graduate jobs will go to them.

3. Employers are sometimes intimidated by younger men. Want to hit on pretty young women as well.


These three factors are why we have this problem.

Work that pays out salaries high enough to avoid poverty either require a high level of skill, which women don't have because they pursue worthless meme degrees as a rule, or a high level of physical ability, which women don't have because they're women. Therefore, women are a big part of the low skill labour demographic being increasingly edged into poverty by an economy being inflated to hell. Efforts to lift them out of poverty usually focus around DEI practices intended to hire them into fabricated, well paying, adult daycare labour positions such as human resources and redundant administration.

They kind of ruined the anime with race swaps and gay characters. If you can grit your teeth through all the scenes with black women and fags you can get to some high quality capeshit but they make you wade through fire to enjoy it. The original comic didn't have the black woman character, she was white, and I don't know if it had the gay character or if they just didn't mention it as much. They insist on adding a gay subplot that nobody cares about for a side character nobody cares about. That's Amazon for you. Check those DEI boxes.
The source comic is high quality though.

That, plus the fact that their base would argue against killing brown people for whatever reason. The dems have transitioned their party into the party of trannies, gays, supporting browns, all that shit, and those folks would never sign up to nuke Iran. By letting Trump nuke Iran, the dems get to keep their chosen identity, point to Trump as a mass murderer of browns, and still deliver big weapon orders to Raytheon.
It even gives the dems a couple of years to try to swing their party away from being focused on trannies, and try to win back the blue collar rust belt types that reject that shit. They understand DEI/tranny story hour/grooming is becoming less popular by the day, and they don't want to get steamrolled for the next few years.

Bullshit. It’s college professors gatekeeping the degrees necessary to make it to middle management who make all the hiring decisions. There’s a reason college educated whites dramatically skew towards Biden and it’s not because they’re smart. It’s because they’re more submissive and take directions better and thus more receptive of the DEI globohomo agenda while men and conservatives are dramatically more likely to tell them to fuck off and start their own business.

They confirm with leadership if that building should have another sniper on it, etc. Maybe this lasts an entire minute. You don't let that go on a half hour. Worst case scenario, you're not willing to shoot some unknown, so you send over a team to get on that roof and ask why the fuck they're not answering on radio. You don't leave it unchallenged. I won't stoop to calling this a conspiracy... there's more than enough DEI incompetence to explain this shit. But don't softpedal this either.

100%. And they do it just to be petty and to cost their opponents security fees to hurt their campaigns. It’s slimey and undemocratic as fuck on top of putting them in danger. Frankly they shouldn’t want Secret Service at this point. They’ve shown themselves to be incompetent and biased which is no surprise when the Director of SS and DHS are both Biden appointees who’s jobs depend on him winning re-election and insist on DEI hires.

It's honestly kind of insane how power-obsessed these niggers are. Remember how Trump got 3 SC picks? If those three old niggerfaggots had just retired when Obama began his second term the demonrats could have had 3 young Supreme Court judges but instead they hold onto power for life because they have nothing else. Same with Bidet. He should have dropped out years ago. And the new niggers replacing them will just vote for the same DEI shit so what do they care?

You know Neelix in Star Trek Voyager? He's an accomplished diplomat and merchant in the Delta Quadrant; but the hoo-man supremacists of Voyager didn't respect what he could really bring to their ship and treated him like a second class Sambo/Tonto who was superfluous.

DEI corporate positions are like that. It's a 'morale officer', while others do the 'real' work.

Those female agents were DEI hires because they're there to exist, not to have any real input or real contribution to the job.

Kimberley Cheatle is a DEI hire because she has no autonomy and implements what those above her tell her to. There is a slight possibility those shitty reasons she gave for why Trump was inadequately protected was the first time she'd heard those reasons herself.

This was a hit on Trump. She did what she was told. Keep a watch on who 'commits suicide' around her within the next 18 months.

Red herring. If you had inside knowledge of Trump’s impending death there are a gorillion other market moves you could do that are less conspicuous and make you more money. Basically to put it in terms /biz/tards would understand it’s the financial equivalent of Chris Watts.

It wasn’t a short either just put options, realistically probably a commitment of 300-400k. Rumble and Truth Social will tank if the general trend against censoring conservative voices online is in decline, which appears to be the case.

If anything I think the shady thing here is that they may have had inside knowledge of Microsoft laying off the DEI team. It’s indicative of the pendulum swinging back in tech and if you had inside information on it investments against DJT/Rumble would be good low key hedges that wouldn’t raise eyebrows .

That's why it's important to confront people like Carmack who try to draw a false equivalence between the usual and customary consequences for such abhorrent behavior as cheering on assassination, and the novel left-wing tactic of "cancelling" people who disagree with them on any issue. Don't let them get away with trying to say that ruining someone's life for refusing to go submit to leftist demands like DEI is the same thing as shunning someone who openly advocates for political assassination.

I think the most effective real life pitch for this is “races are different” rather than “some races are better” but yeah you get the idea.
The leftoids are ready to commit suicide/kill whitey but the right has enough people that still care. I worry that this anti-DEI push will transform the right into the civnat mind virus. “Merit over race always” (only the jews define merit in this case).

Anti-DEI = “Merit over race”
Demographically Responsible Immigration Reform (pre-1965) = “Race over (((merit)))”

They’re killing DEI to kill support for the immigration reform necessary for whites in the future.

> The director of equity at the Secret Service calls it a "mission imperative" and the "ultimate goal" to spread DEI within the agency, with the agency hosting seminars on "respectful use of pronouns."

>The executive director of the Secret Services' Office of Equity Loucious Hires III discussed diversity, equity and inclusion, "a topic that is difficult for some to talk about," on the official government podcast "Standing Post" in February 2023. The agency said it was striving to be the "gold standard" of DEI in a recruitment brochure that same year.

> "We like every other organization. We benefit from diversity. And I actually am seeing more openly… trans recruits out of the training center, law enforcement recruits, which is great," Cannady said on the agency podcast in 2022.

> provides advice and counsel on personnel, human resources, security clearance and other employment law matters at the agency. He said the Secret Service has put on programming to educate its workforce on how to use pronouns.

>"We will put on things during Unity Day, which, you know, for listeners, is the annual day of the Secret Service, where we celebrate various groups… that the Secret Service has in its workforce. And, you know, during that, we've hosted things like a seminar on the respectful use of pronouns, to sort of try to educate the workforce," he said. "Because some of this stuff, you know, is cutting edge and new and people that just may not be familiar with it."

Just had a brain blast about how we’re getting cornered by the powers that be.
DEI is being allowed to be attacked by the right and die so that we can’t get support for demographically responsible immigration reform as that comes up when white population declines to a certain percentage.
They will call it “the return of DEI” and the normie right will say merit is all that matters and it’ll be crushed.
The issue needs to be raised as soon as possible. “Demographically responsible immigration reform”. Or we’re fucked.

It all depends on who you are. There are some groups that are doing very well from our new world order. DEI hires in civil service jobs for one. Any woman or immigrant who works in the (((health))) care sector. Boomers in general. Wagies in a small number of niche sectors. So it all depends. In communist China they refer to the state sector jobs as a Golden bowl in reference to the magic bowl of rice that never empties. As we morph into a state led communist dystopia jobs in the government (that includes Rnhs) will naturally become the benefactors of everyone elses suffering, its to be expected.

I don’t know what nick expects from Trump right at this moment, I think he is just throwing a tantrum because he selected Vance as VP (which is a place politicians go to die and limit their power) and he’s mad that Vance is anti Trump race mixer, but again VP literally does not matter. He’s literally just throwing a tantrum and it makes me think he’s controlled opposition at best, or a crybaby zoomie at worst.

Of course it was an inside job
Are you guys all new here or something? and obviously the faggot pushed by the FBI is a patsy, real shooters were located elsewhere
But it’s so fucking weird. If they wanted him dead, he’d be dead. Like with JFK for comparison there were at minimum three teams of shooters at triangulated positions to absofuckinglutely guarantee mission success. You don’t just go 9/10 kf the mile then drop the ball completely at the end. “He turned his head, anon” Bullshit. There should have been at least 3 full contact hits, if there were 8 rounds fired. It just doesn’t happen, they have PLENTY of skilled combat-hardened mercenaries for any job, don’t be fooled by competency crisis shit. At the real upper echelons they couldn’t care less about DEI.
Either 1) Act of God
Or 2) Secret technology was used. Either to protect Trump or to intentionally skim his face with an AI-controlled projectile. That’s my conclusion, #2.

But what do you expect with how police are treated, you get scum of the scum, the profession already had a propensity to attract scum who wanted to lord over other people, but now that no decent human wants to become a cop these become an even larger proportion of the police force. That's no teven talking about niggers getting hired for DEI, which increases all those things plus even more corruption.

Only mention of race is they really want to ban any form of affirmative action or DEI. It literally says DEI "Satanic Marxism".

That being said they want border control to be able to shoot and kill anyone that illegally tries to cross the border and calling for mass deportation and end of birthright citizenship unless at least one parent is American. They consider anyone who attempts to illegally cross the border an invader and therefore an enemy combatant under international law.

lol pajeets are so insecure, self-centered they made their own racial enclave for their own. Even the nature itself segregate pajeets as outcast. Just like they are the casteless among the entire human race

>>474652045
they are like that: self-centered thinking everyone else are beneath them. They are exactly like jews.
They slip in bigger masses of POC while fortify themselves inside their in-group club and leech/steal off others' merits for their own personal (like how kikes blend in Whites and you know what). And it is their way to survive. even DEI in workplace realize that pajeet exclusive hiring is the elephant in the room.

Kissinger even said that they are masters of flattery, talented on sucking off/bootlicking people in position of power. That's how they survive thousand of years; being subservient slaves. If their masters know their true colors, pajeets would be extinct long time ago for how abysmal they are.

South Asians; indians, pakis, bengals are absolute shitters. They make village idiot, savage chinks look like civilized beings.

The prime reason why jeets are propped up as global shitskins replacing Whites is because they are kikes favorites; the most absolute philosemite race that will never threaten kikes. Even chinks, sandniggers, aperican niggers, even loincloth native americans aware on JQ and fight back. And pajeets realize that kikes are just like that and much more powerful; hence their absolute admiration over israel.

>Incorrect. Geniuses are only geniuses in specialized fields they excel at.
This is objectively wrong. Being a genius relates do mental capacity, which a genius is superior at. Many geniuses focus on specific things (such as Tesla), others distribute their focus around (polymaths), but the fact still stands. If you and Carmack were called to learn about bird patterns in Nepal, he'd learn it faster than you.
>You are trying some retarded semantics here
You're just wrong, you were raised on libtard logic that "we're all equal" and "geniuses are just monkeys and like, the school system is like climbing trees but like, some of us are fishes" rationalization.

It's a fair point, and likely a big contributor to his position. He has no reason to want things to escalate further, both because he's living a good life and because he's too old to fight for himself.

Here’s one, I’ll post more - the Obama campaign had ALL of the Hillary campaign’s email network compromised by having a black woman apply to be a network assistant for a job advertised on their site. She got the role and through the system with DEI points. A thumb drive and Ethernet tap was applied to the server room. This is how they learned about Hillary’s secret email server hosted at her home in New York.

after the SCOTUS decision he was extremely disappointed in the result, and gave a bunch of remarks (spoken and written) in favor of DEI/AA for university admissions and for other programs, and continually talked about how non-White races are constantly disenfranchsed in the US, which is the opposite of the truth. there are special programs for any class of people except for straight White males. even straight asian males have their own special pipelines for admissions/scholarships/jobs. kennedy is retarded on this issue.
>israel
he constantly has talked about israeli friends, poses with israeli flags, menorahs, etc.
>gun control
It's more that his position has changed a lot over time. I'm not trying to come across as knocking him hard or anything, just proffering some reasons why he isn't too popular, because some of these issues are a bit more subtle, and things change over time. no candidate is perfect, and there is some strategy for winning elections. I think Trump should/would have won in a landslide with nearly any other VP pick. But I just cannot vote (implying votes matter) for the same bullshit with a literal pro-war, pro-israeli best ally CIA glowie as VP. I'm ridin with kennedy regardless.

if you want a real reason why people arent into RFK here, it's because it's anti-gun, pro-DEI/affirmative action, and is pro-israel. But he's still relatively against the deep state and against conflicts.

Trump's current ticket, especially with Vance, is worse on all of those issues except for being anti-gun. Vance is Palantir. Trump/Pence is more pro-israeli than RFKJr, and they are pro war. Trump's last time in office also repealed tons of environmental and food regulations, while pushing vaccines. fuck that shit (yes trump has changed his stance on vaccines, however). fwiw I think RFK is less anti-gun these days.

It was already shown in Trump's first term that the non-white policies like 1965 immigration law wasn't overturned and reinstate the White America policy of old, and USA kept getting browner.
But it seems like they're going to drop the act and just push pro-jew and anti-white policies from both parties now.

They are both controlled by Israel anyway and the policy is dictated from Knesset.

A legendary secret service inherited by libs who thought it operated the way it did by itself. Put in untrained DEI people, cut corners, no incidents...procedures become optional and nothing happens for years and years and you think what you're doing is working bc nothing has happened and get comfy.

And then at this rally, some kid is standing by a building (as seen in the video) waiting for someone to confront him, and nothing happens. He walks far away and doesn't see anyone on the roof. So he goes to the back of the building and nobody bothers him. He gets his rifle from the bushes and climbs up the AC units and now he's on the roof. Clear line of sight. He starts crawling into position and there's no interference except ppl yapping on the ground level. It doesn't matter though bc there are huge loudspeakers w trump still talking and nobody can hear shit. A cop pokes his head up on the roof and startles the kid as he gets in position. The kid points rifle at cop who falls down 8 feet from being scared. Trump is still talking. Kid gets into position and shoots his shot.

He didn't have to do shit to take his shots. The incompetent SS had no deterrents in place to stop him.

They spend 8-10 years in Kurdistan in some outpost sitting around and confirming over and over that nothing is happening, come back, become advisors and have no skills, and the agency weakens.

They already revolted, when the topic came up early in the war. They got rid of the patriotic white males, and replaced them with DEI troops- fags, trannies, females, nogs, etc. They're entitled with no patriotism, so even if it concerned USA they wouldn't want to fight- but zoomers hate shitrael, so there's no way that it could happen. There would be riots, protests, and the DEI troops simply wouldn't fight. It's why the Army started putting out their all white troop commercials, since (((they're))) scared.

First ban DEI shit and force hiring to be merit based like it used to be. Also get rid of fake jobs like HR who literally just get paid to sit there all day. If a company needs to hire someone the manager can handle the hiring like they did basically everywhere before HR existed. Bring back physical standard requirements for jobs like police and military thereby basically preventing 99.99999% of women from being able to qualify.

Tax people significantly more for being childless and unmarried.(If the couple is unable to have children allow adoption to fix the tax issue.) At the same time ban no fault divorce. For the finale make adultery a felony crime. That would fix shit real quick for both men and women.

Women will be begging to be housewives within 5 years if you do all that. Also fixes the problem of degenerate men going around fucking every woman they possibly can.

Kek, where is this happening? Media still hates Trump. They're just going after Biden now because they know he can't win.

>You have companies now getting rid of DEI..

Because they realized it's a waste of money and gives them a competitive disadvantage if all they're allowed to hire is trans black women.

there was one that looked like a dyke but I would put my pistol in her holster no problem.
when the shit went down she was shooting the cuff on her suit energetically and her sunglasses fell of and when she bent over to pick up her sunglasses I could tell I would fuck her.
she had zero qualifications for her job, but she failed in style.
she made sure her man suit was perfect before securing Trump in the vehicle and got those sunglasses on toot sweet while Amy Schumer was trying to holster her DEI issue Glock flashlight knife gun which she managed to muzzle every single person in the video with before finally getting her little flipper arms to work out the muscle memory.

I hate DEI, women, niggers and spics and jeets more than anyone. But it's not enough to explain what happened. This isn't "they were just really fucking incompetent". This is "they were incompetent to such an absurd degree that can't even be rationalized"

It would be like going to McDonald's, ordering a big Mac, going home and opening the bag to find a shoe in it. Not exactly "I said no pickles and they put pickles on it!". It's a shoe. They put a shoe in it. There would be no level of incompetence to explain it. They quite obviously intentionally put a shoe in the bag and served it to you.

Boeing is a striking confluence of everything wrong with coporations. As such, while being exemplary in many ways, it isn't a good example to hold for the competency crisis as the destruction is coming from so many angles.
Just to list a few:
>corporate buyout / sell-out of company values
>accounting-driven
>DEI (CC)
>whistleblowers dying - end game corporatism
>outsourcing jobs (CC possibly)
>advertising masquerades as safety - your pilots don't need training!
>ad hoc engineering solution - MCAS AOA sensor
>no redundancy in system design - engineering incompetence (CC)
>endless C-suite faggotry and golden parachutes
>government regulatory collusion
>not facing consequences for killing 346 - slap on wrist fines
This is coming from a casual observer angle as well. I have hardly gone out of my way to watch more than a couple of documentaries and a little bit of thinking. Many mega-corporations share similar features. Don't even have to get into /pol/ issues like the jew and such.
It might be a worthwhile thing to plot CC trendline. Where does it start, and where are we at now.
I am not sure what the earliest example would be. Fast food zoomers are one angle, they are too incompetent to even hold fast food jobs.

He was kind of making a point, though. Cops are told that the most important thing is that they get to go home safely to their families at the end of their shift. Which is a smart thing to tell your disposable heroes, morale-wise, because the younger ones used to still be brave enough to die, despite the mission statement, once their adrenaline was flowing. Post DEI, which I'd say is 80% among leadership positions, I don't know that any cop is going to do shit except MAYBE cover his buddy's ass along with his own.

I'm not sure many people understand how thoroughly government, including public safety, has been scrubbed of honor and tradition. I know too much about this so I'll shut up now.

He was an accelerationist. The SS & law enforcement that let it happen are accelerationists with a healthy mix of incompetent. This is the most plausible scenario. This explains Crooks's confusing political alignment. He was a 20-year old edgelord who believed "burn it all down and rebuild" and thought (correctly) that shooting Trump was the quickest way to cause a civil war.

The federal agencies involved in protecting the President are a mish-mash of incompetent DEI hires and blackpilled white guys who see their situation as hopeless. The DEI hires are too fucking retarded to protect anyone, and the blackpilled white guys aligned ideologically with the edgelord shooter. They figured, fuck it, we can't reverse the incompetence in our agencies, might as well burn it down and start over. So they did everything they possibly could to let the shooter take his shots.

You will never hear an official explanation that touches on this though. It will always be "muh slipped through the cracks" and "muh he had no online presence" and they'll paddock it.

Ineffective Coordination and Communication

The sniper teams were not communicating effectively, leading to critical blind spots. Effective communication is vital in high-stakes scenarios to ensure all potential threat vectors are covered. The lack of coordination among the sniper teams resulted in a failure to detect and respond to the shooter.

In high-profile security operations, communication protocols are established to maintain situational awareness and coordinate responses. The breakdown in communication observed in this incident suggests either a failure to adhere to these protocols or intentional interference.

Lack of Immediate Action by Cops

Cops stationed outside AGR International did nothing when the shooter pointed a gun at them. All the cop needed to do was shoot into the ground to enact protection actions, but this basic response was not taken. Similarly, cops inside the AGR International building did nothing while the shooter climbed the roof.

The inaction of the cops indicates a significant lapse in security procedures. The failure to respond to a direct threat raises questions about their training, instructions, and potential involvement in the conspiracy.

Untrained or Under-qualified Personnel

The replacement of highly trained USSS agents with less experienced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) females compromised the effectiveness of the security detail. The timing and nature of these personnel changes raise questions about their motivations. Deploying less experienced personnel at such a critical time undermined the overall security operation.

The decision to replace experienced agents with less qualified personnel suggests an intentional effort to weaken the security detail. This change in personnel likely contributed to the numerous lapses and failures observed during the event.

The worst part is that the Assassin would've loved what the RNC had on offer so he died for nothing, and the Man in the Crowd would've Hated what the RNC had on offer so he died for nothing, so that was entirely pointless since they're both the same thing.

With the new age of tech and DEI, a combination of scrutiny and incompetence has given us all a window to observe how evil our government and its owners truly are. This is probably why DEI seems to be shrinking away in corporate sphears, along with the "in your face" part of the woke agenda being dumped. They will ditch DEI and woke faggotry in time I'm sure, and go back to the old way of doing things. In my opinion it was likely all an expirament. They probably expected women and niggers to be competant enough to keep society in the dark like they did with the egregious Kennedy assassinations and 9/11. The people at the top will still be evil, but competant evil. Their merit and allegiance to retarded demons gods like Moloch and Baphomet will determine their place in government. The Devil we did know was atleast stupid and easy to trigger. These new ruthless assholes will be silent but deadly all of the way. Enjoy Richard Levine while you can guys. Clowns like him will be replaced with no nonsense Satanic traitors.

This is some of the starkest evidence we've ever had regarding the potential danger of DEI/affirmative action. We got to see the female agents on the ground look like inept idiots and nearly get him killed, and we get to see the female director look like a smug inept idiot and, perhaps most importantly, take no accountability for something she is directly accountable for. If she were Trump's director of SS she would have been fired on Sunday. Were she a man with any dignity or sense of accountability she would have resigned on Monday. Instead, she's a smug, retarded woman that doesn't belong there and she's going to continue smugly insisting she had nothing to do with direct organizational and operational breakdown.

If you take the name of any institution that is failing, like the Secret Service or the Pennsylvania State Police or even Boeing, and then type in DEI after it and search.
This is why we are falling apart.
Take every theory, every single data we DON'T know about the assassination attempt out of the equation and input what everyone DOES know. that DEI just about got a former President and the Nominee of his party killed.
And innocent bystanders were killed and injured.
this all lay squarely at teh feet of a defeated ideology.

I'm sorry but I find this to be a straight up slave mentality. How do people even think like this? If I'm off doing my own thing somewhere, no I'm not representing my company. That's absurd. I get that mentally ill people on twitter are like this but if you meet some asshole at the bar, do you immediately think about whatever company he works for? As for "promote speech they might not want to", that is also ridiculous. Any company of a sufficient size is going to have people with conflicting opinions. So should any person in the company with a slightly different opinion always keep their mouth shut because it might be different than what the company officially supports? Even on their private time? I mean this is the current reality of many employed conservatives right now. Most of them probably disagree with their company's DEI programs. It seems like you're totally fine with continuing to oppress. And just one more thing. Whatever I say on my time is MY opinion. It is not the company's opinion. They are not promoting anything just because one guy who happens to work for them says something.

its a buzz term thats already been parroted by msm, and its simple enough for even the rednecks who can't read to understand. the fact is even if a grand conspiracy is true most Americans don't want to read or even listen to an explanation, and even more of them can't compose a grand conspiracy on spot without being behind a keyboard with sources ready to go. Just as you said, call it DEI and then watch them fall apart as they realize in real time they can't actually explain it as something deeper.

That is precisely what this is. If a qualified individual was running the SS, no would be having this conversation. A big part of diversity is having options, and it looks like this time the option they went with for SS supervisor was a bad one. It doesn't have to be anyone's fault, but Kimberly Cheatle will only further hurt her goals of increasing diversity in government organizations by refusing to step down. It sends a message to the American people the DEI is not in their best interest and our creditors cannot have allow a sentiment like that to persist.

And therein lies the problem with your argument because what you are proposing doesn't mean shit unless it is actually passed as law.

And why the fuck should companies be obligated to hire some retard who runs their mouth and gives the company a bad reputation? You have every right to work somewhere else and you have no obligation to say yes to your employment contract so why don't you just work at a company that doesn't care instead?

>b-but anon there isn't one that will hire me.

Sucks to be you. Make a company then. Why should the success of other hard working people and their enterprises be dragged down by your notoriety? Get off your ass and make a company with your own rules if you don't like it, work hard and compete the capitalist way or shut your bitch ass up and stop trying to force companies to keep you on regardless of how much you drag their reputation through the mud and impact their revenue as a result.

DEI has already removed most straight white males from any position of influence within these companies and whites are a tiny percentage of new hires.
The program has achieved it's goals, browns can be relied upon to exclude whites, and it's now raising more alarm bells than it's worth.
Microsoft specifically are looking for an edge over their competition with generative AI and DEI-fags are a disproportionate drag on those programs

I did read it. That is how the jew dialectic functions though. Get a few globohomo institutions and organizations to back off of the DEI shit in a superficial way. At the same time, the get conservative Republican Party a White man might otherwise have thought is on his side somewhat dive head first into DEI.
The White man who is against the DEI stuff is then left feeling like he has no political home, no political voice, and must accept the new normal.
Then the Globohomo institutions and organizations resume their extreme DEI measures, pushing the issue further along.

None of these things means the sign was or is wrong. We’ve seen all of this before.

Speaking as someone who has liberal views but hates wokeness, it's because for decades, there's been media and propaganda that paints hetero cisgender white men as the source of evil. YASS QUEEN and all that other jazz is what's being peddled.

Coupled with this browbeating, women get more favorable advantages. Look at the workplace. A lying bitch can make up shit about a dude or say "he makes her uncomfortable" while she sits in a cushy office job and does jackshit. Or get into good universities to check off DEI boxes.

I haven't been on the dating market since 2017. I was too busy working, saving, and finishing my masters after undergrad. Then corona lockdown really dampened social contact. But even as a kid growing up in the late 00's and throughout the 2010's, you realize what a shitshow the world has become.

The juice ain't worth the squeeze gentlemen. Don't approach women, don't help them, don't interact with them unless you have to and be absolutely professional.

Microsoft just fired its DEI team in trend that has been going on in the corporate world over the last year.

Ineffective Coordination and Communication

The sniper teams were not communicating effectively, leading to critical blind spots. Effective communication is vital in high-stakes scenarios to ensure all potential threat vectors are covered. The lack of coordination among the sniper teams resulted in a failure to detect and respond to the shooter.
In high-profile security operations, communication protocols are established to maintain situational awareness and coordinate responses. The breakdown in communication observed in this incident suggests either a failure to adhere to these protocols or intentional interference.

Lack of Immediate Action by Cops

Cops stationed outside AGR International did nothing when the shooter pointed a gun at them. All the cop needed to do was shoot into the ground to enact protection actions, but this basic response was not taken. Similarly, cops inside the AGR International building did nothing while the shooter climbed the roof.

The inaction of the cops indicates a significant lapse in security procedures. The failure to respond to a direct threat raises questions about their training, instructions, and potential involvement in the conspiracy.

Untrained or Underqualified Personnel

The replacement of highly trained USSS agents with less experienced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) females compromised the effectiveness of the security detail. The timing and nature of these personnel changes raise questions about their motivations. Deploying less experienced personnel at such a critical time undermined the overall security operation.

The decision to replace experienced agents with less qualified personnel suggests an intentional effort to weaken the security detail. This change in personnel likely contributed to the numerous lapses and failures observed during the event.

MAGA is the most truly liberal movement Anonymous ID:/vK/65ws Wed 17 Jul 2024 06:35:41 No.474553218  Replies: 7 ViewReport
The MAGA coalition includes whites, hispanics, blacks, asians, kikes, catholics, hindus, atheists, straights, gays, trannies, etc. It's truly diverse and truly inclusive, accepting everyone from all backgrounds as long as they adhere to a few American cultural aspects such as belief in the Constitution and being patriotic. A black lesbian porn star with tattoos and a nose ring can be a MAGA supporter just as much as some blue collar white guy from Kansas. MAGA also truly believes in meritocracy, unlike the left. Really, MAGA is what liberalism would be like if DEI and woke didn't infiltrate and subvert almost every American institution. MAGA is a return to 90s style liberalism. Anyone of any background can be an American as long as they wave an American flag and shout "MAGA!"

You can support Trump as much as you want, and desu 90s liberalism is much better than what we've been living through the last decade, but don't be delusional and think that Trump is going to create a based tradcath society, or usher forward an ethnonationalist nietzschean ubermensch movement.

White American men are generally cucks and simp to their wives once they get married. It doesn't matter who they are; even chad can turn into a cuck once they get married, some even trooned out due to his pozzed wife. Pretty much many White husbands are controlled by their wives like a puppet
And politicians are no exception, in fact it is even worse: Every single White American politicians that racemix, have weakness of subtle allegiance with their non-white wives because they fear of getting divorced. Their shitskin wives whisper on their ears for women's whimsical wishes.

Fun thing about the 1st is you can call for the gassing of all kikes. But as soon as you name a single one that you want dead, it's an issue because it shows directed intent instead of just a general disdain for a group.
What Fatgass did was the latter. What the pro Palestinian protesters at Harvard were doing was the former. Which is why the fraud DEI hire was hilariously right in her statements and understanding of the law when she was under the gun for not shutting the protests down.

Cancelling/removing culture reached its zenith during the summer of Floyd. When you see cities burn and told it a peaceful protest or businesses looted as police instructed to watch or teaching children that man there is a woman and if you get the pronoun wrong you are thrown into a gulag. Most sane folk will finally stop going alone with obvious lies. That has happened. I've already noticed white women and white men together in media ads pop up and if a black male is included hes the product pitcher not the partner of the blond. These are baby steps like Tractor Supply and John Deere abandoning DEI programs of social engineering and focusing on their provide a good product at a fair price for customers.

Again, DEI isn’t going away, it’s just being rebranded.
The RNC went full DEI on opening night and even if all illegals are deported they just want to flood the country “legally” with poojeets.

The biggest problem isn't the fact that there wasn't local le or usss on the roof; it's the fact that at the mere hint of a suspicious person didn't immediately prompt a command from usss to fastwalk trump off the stage and into the truck to await an all clear. No, instead, they all dicked around over the radio while barney fife checked the guy out, fell off the ladder and allowed the kid to sight trump back in and fire which resulted in the countersnipers taking him out. During ALL that time, not ONE fucking person thought to maybe stop the speech out of precaution.
THAT'S the problem.
And all this DEI bullshit is distraction. They want you focusing on that instead of the real culprits: obama/hillary/biden/"deep state" niggers.

There are a few differences. Not many of importance. You're not changing the banking cartel.
But the democrats do use executive order to push DEI and anti-meritocracy through all institutions and the public sector. Trump specifically does not do this. Merit among your society is a hugely important concept and this is the last traces slipping out. As is being oil independent and having low gas prices is genuinely better for your economy and citizens.

These are modest things, but it's the difference in how quickly you want the nation to implode.

You guys have no idea how fucking worse things are going to get
This shit starts way back, around 2010 or earlier
Before then, big tech was a haven for white nerds. If you wanted to do awesome shit with the best gear available and surrounded by smart people, it was the place to go.
Awesome shit was made. Gmaps was literal magic at the time. Some things that were thought as technically impossible became reality in years.
Then suits moved in. The smart ones understood what was going to happen immediately. A good portion just left with the coffers and started their own startup - only to be bought back again (the big "acquihire" wave of the mid 2010). Most retired after that.
Smart whites started doing shit like working at google for 3-4 years, living in a van outside in the parking lot, and saving literal millions in order to retire right after that. I personally know one that did, he's now chilling in costa rica, never to work again.
This was all before the DEI holocaust. That started around 2016. By that time, everyone was already bleeding talent profusely with no end in sight.
DEI was the death sentence for everything even remotely related to R&D at those companies. They now barely manage to keep the things that were made by white engineers decades ago. AWS, google cloud, azure are all kept running by a handful of white engineers in their 50s. They cover those guys in gold so they don't leave (I know none personally but I heard stories of comps of over 10$Mil a year).
But at some point they will. There is no replacement, and there's no way to train replacements as all talent is long gone. Most core tech at those companies is treated as magic black boxes, nobody dares to touch it.

Boomers are characteristically big talking, abject cowards. This guy called the old man's bluff. Even though he failed in his mission, Trump will now have to fear assassination everywhere he goes... and as a result he has lost the will to keep his promises (though doubtful he ever had it to begin with).
Trump has now folded with his calls for "unity" (which is really just the DEI agenda). Boomers will vote for him because they simply want their own branded version of DEI.
He will win, but it will be a Pyrrhic victory.

It isn't all or nothing. The tide is turning. My workplace went super woke in 2020 and even they are starting to backtrack on the language and pulling back on funding. As it turns out, straight white men aren't actually the cause of all of the world's problems. Who knew? Even Mr. Rosensteinberg is getting sick of dealing with Shaniqua's nonsense.

Think about it. Who are you going to have a better work relationship with, the darkie with zero experience who was hired because of his skin, or the darkie who was hired entirely based on his extensive experience in the field?

Yes you'll be getting a LOT fewer if it only hire based on talent and skill, but at least you get actual workers that can exist in teams without being concrete collars on their white colleagues trying to stay afloat.

Nothing builts racism and resentment more than seeing people being given positions they could never have gotten otherwise if not for quotas. If all you have to offer a company and potential coworkers is your black hide or a Mexican surname, you should KYS.

Exactly. Its just too many things. They refused him extra security. They diverted his regular team to Jill Biden. People saw him and told cops but no one cared. For 27 minutes. A cop confronted him, knowing he was armed and let the suspect draw on him first, then left the roof without radioing anybody before or after. And also there were no SS units on the roof in the first place because the roof was tilted... oops that sounded dumb no its because it was too hot up there, like oh em geez you guise.

Do I have to spell it out for you Agent Retard? There is reports of a second shooter, the story of "oh gee willy that goober cop just stood down when a gun was pointed at him". Cops/SS inside the building don't even bother to investigate the roof, the most obvious fucking thing. Even DEI retard women have to take basic courses to become Secret Service and learn the basics of scouting things out. So why did Blackrock sell that building right before the assassination glownigger agent? Why did Trumps media get shorted when everything showed him rising in the polls steadily post debate? Why did he get shorted 8 million dollars right before this happened? Why did Blackrock Pull that video? Why did they happen to own that Building in the first place? Lets talk about AGR. Whats the history with them? You know what shithead? Keep at your little game, eventually this is all going to come out.

People say I'm a shill but this really does look like lone wolf + DEI security. It seems improbable, but all the other explanations seem impossible or make no sense.

The idea that it's a false flag makes no sense. That either means they aimed for his ear (ridiculous) or used fake blood (ridiculous). Plus if they wanted him reelected they just have to let the election play out. He will win a legit election or they could just steal it for him. Why would they need to go through this ridiculous charade?

So what else could it be? If the intel agencies wanted him dead he would be dead. Zionists don't want him dead - they have been signaling that they are going to reinstall him, especially since the debate.... so did the anti-zionist jews do it? How could they fuck up that bad? If they wanted him dead, he'd be dead.

It seems like it was a lone wolf and the kid was probably shitting his pants and jerked the trigger. Or had a bad zero on the rifle. Or both. The diversity service failed to properly coordinate with the local cops. They are stupid and lazy. Also in the aftermath all kinds of information was immediately getting out. It wasn't a well oiled intelligence operation. If the was a planned patsy they would have had a narrative about his motivation ready immediately. I haven't heard anything about his motivation. The glowies seem as confused as we are.

With Trump’s recent assassination attempt, the seeming synchronization of many of his former enemies in the media and politics coming to his side, the increasing denunciation of DEI, the supposed Iranian follow up assassination attempt on Trump, the doubling down of RNC and MAGA to worshipping Israel — all seems incredibly stage managed.

I think what we’re seeing is a deep state dialectic reaction forming under Trump which Biden was the set up for now that his political capital has expired, and this is the reaction and the reaction is going to be essentially a typical American political deep state “rebranding” aka meet the new boss same as the old boss.

Expect a likely detachment from Ukraine with Trump as the U.S. declares victory and then memory holes the entire debacle (just like with Covid), expect no accountability, and then expect a New CrisisTM that will flood the MSM and NPC brains. Expect war in the ME involving the U.S. and increased belligerence towards China. The neocon empire at all costs. I think if you’re optimistic, you’re a fool.

>The best possible path Europe can take
Why can't Europe follow China? China is an ethnostate where 93% of the population is Han Chinese, with essentially zero Jews, zero blacks, and zero Indians (including Roma gypsies). The minorities follow Chinese social and cultural norms. China is Socialist, so they provide for their people, 90% own their homes. The absence of violent and parasite races means they can have efficient public transportation, public healthcare, and unattended honor system shops. Being a single party meritocratic dictatorship, they don't have parasites buying control. Basically no degeneracy, or DEI nonsense.

The last time Europe had anything like this was during the late 1930s and early1940s. Think about it.

How many do we have to believe to buy into the narrative that's being manufactured before our eyes?

>The shooter was the perfect sterotype loner, a perfect target for manipulation.
>He came into contact with the propaganda arm of the largest corporate sponsor of DEI and globalism on the planet?
>He made the most expensive protection force in the world look like the keystone cops while simultaneously acting suspicious-af for half an hour.
>He lays down exposed on the roof of the building in view of a sniper team for at least two minutes before shooting. During this time, he threatens a cop with the gun, in plain view of the snipers observing him.
>He gets off multiple rounds, the first of which is millimeters away from being a kill shot, before being silenced by the unfortunately tardy counter-sniper fire.

What else?

If the contents of his cell phone aren't transparently made public, I would expect that Trump is going to have to keep dodging assassination attempts from here on in. They know the game is up, so they're ready to call it early and do the chaos thing.

Did “they” legitimately mean to take Trump out and failed? Anonymous ID:kMzzG390 Tue 16 Jul 2024 19:53:06 No.474506273  Replies: 87 ViewReport
Quoted By: >>474507153
There are too many oddities with the inaction taken by the SS and police for this to have been an actual lone wolf scenario. IMO, two scenarios are most probable. Either they staged EVERYTHING and had some method for faking the blood while still using real bullets for the crowd; or it was a legitimate assassination attempt by the deep state that failed.

The fact that this basically guaranteed Trumps re-election while making Biden look even weaker leads me to think it was all staged. But if their goal was to cause a civil war blowing Trump’s brains out on live tv would have been a damn good way to kick that off.

Do the Illuminati types ever play games based purely on chance? You know, like hire a DEI sniper with a 70% chance of hitting the mark; if you survive, one timeline occurs, if you don’t then a more negative timeline follows?

It could be “fake” in the sense that the shooter was told to hit various points but not hit Trump himself. However this of course means they faked the blood and I’m not sure exactly how they would have done it. That post about him having something in his hand is inaccurate. If you go back he has his palms facing the camera a few seconds before the first shot.

A possibility I do think is likely is that this was a legitimate deep state assassination attempt that failed. There’s an Illuminati card with “our shooters can take you out” with a face similar to Trumps. It’s very possible they wanted a headshot broadcast on live tv to start an American civil war and their DEI sniper fucked it up.

Retard, it was the Jews. They're scared shitless of Trump getting elected again so they planned this faggy DEI bullshit at the RNC to steal votes away from him.

They also paid for Trump to pick that faggot coal burner Vance as his VP so they can replace him with a good goy white replacement enabler when the next assassination attempt succeeds.

This is quite possibly the most obvious Jewish ploy of all time. You'd have to be retarded not to see it.

DEI is something that sounds good on paper, but in reality it means hiring total mooks who can't do their job and are focused entirely on extracting company resources while doing no work and moaning about racism constantly, lowering company morale for the actually productive employees.

At some point, someone has to do some actual, real work. It won't be DEI hires. Ergo, they are all negatives, no positives, and were inevitably going to be axed.

Yes, I too despise the cargo-cult treatment that has been applied to notions of "tolerance"
But you're reducing the issue here
Yes, many of the sub-prime loans were given to black
Yes, there was some "muh tolerance" window dressing
But even if those were primarily loans for "tyrones sneakers and laguishas weave"
(which they were not and many irrepsonsible loans were given to people from all walks of life that couldn't pay upfront for whatever it is they were financing - usually single family homes by volume)
the degree of society-wide catastrophy was only and exclusively reached by the systematic prioritization of specualtive greed over financial regulation
The rating agencies were greedy
Lawmakers repealed laws - the same regulatory laws that were passed as a result of the great depression
The banks were greedy
The people just followed along
And since regulatory laws were demolished in the name of liberal economic policy the train was set in motion for its timely wreckage
You just cannot balme this on "niggers pining for and being given loans for frivololous things due to DEI ideology"
It's 99% orthagonal to the actual dynamics that shaped this America (and then world) - wide economic catastrophy we are still suffering from today
