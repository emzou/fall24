technology is getting more powerful but media is turning to trash.

the secret is that the old games are still installable and playable. dont even interact or care about the new pozzed stuff. if you have kids, install the old classics for them. and the thing is the old games are almost always better than the DEI propaganda slop now in every way except graphics, (and often times the graphics in old games are still better too).

The worst nigger. He'd literally stand there and chat with the person running the machine then bitch at me when they miss a defect because I trained them 6 hours prior. And he didn't merely dress me down in private, he called me out specifically at damn near every pre-shift meeting. The other nigger trainer would hang out in his office all day and never get blamed for shit. It was such a two-tiered place to work I had to escape. Worst part was, I started working there before the nigger did. He got placed right into supervisor because of dei.

Most game design teams were much smaller back then anon. Some of the greatest games ever made were from studios that barely reached double digits in employees. You are right about the bloat though. Especially in terms of DEI and shit like Baby Inc who work as commissars for wrongthink.

Nowadays you still have the indie studios and with the tech its easier for them to put out games. The problem now is they cannot handle the larger scale games which will remain shit. You also have a number of game genres that are still dead but many of them are actively being revived by indie devs and old fans who are putting up the initial funds. Recently you even have old timer big names fleeing the larger companies and starting over to redo things from scratch. Except this time hopefully, they will remain in control.

As usual, some niggers complained that they weren’t getting their DEI cut.

It’s always niggers with respect to Mexico.

Unstable government and roving cartels (when pre 1992 we had stable cartel relations) = niggers and because of niggers cia trying to squeeze as much drug productivity out of Mexico to help pay for niggercare and how much niggers really cost America.

Soviet Union collapsed because of their insane military spending, an actual space Star Wars program (they took Reagan seriously), Afghanistan, Ukraine and Chernobyl incident (foreign interference), cia sabotage via computer chip designs, and some republics getting uppity and costing the central ie Russians and Slavs more then they were worth.

America Soviet Union is going to collapse because of niggers.

Ancestral European religions fastest growing religions in the West! Anonymous ID:lwdXRKYA Tue 18 Jun 2024 12:07:33 No.471517877  Replies: 39 ViewReport
With the imminent death of christjewery, Ancestral European religions are about to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

>The levels of degeneracy have likely decreased because of internet-related security, but the levels of you being exposed to it have dramatically increased because of internet-related information.
This is important, yes.
The problem is, we have a situation where many millenials have been coping rather than helping out zoomers, or even worse nuking them by fucking around with their girls a bit too much and making it public.
Not to mention all the people who have been spending money on things they can't regularly afford so that they can spread it on instagram.
It's a good thing to restore standards and encourage zoomers to work for it. But in reality the top 10-15% forgot that 85% live in the same reality as DEI hires and didn't figure out how to lead them properly.
They don't want to share the same reality, but set examples that are more about thumbing their noses rather than knowing how to encourage and get them to follow along. They don't know how to inspire zoomers.
It has its good sides, but they need to reach out to the core zoomer population a bit more and include them in the club, and tell them things like this Canuck poster said in ways younger ones understand. If they don't know how to do this, they need to figure out how. They can take lessons from how others dealt with it instead of beating themselves or zoomers over the head in an unproductive fashion.

>govt prints more money, all assets including new ones increase in value

Except it’s usually for multiple millions not just 1m used for example. Inflation is awesome for them, but interest rates would hurt them if they paid the same as us, which thanks to ESG and DEI the real big fish don’t have to.

Can’t wait what happens next in the United States of nigger daycare.

What will Americans do next. Stay tuned for the next episode of Americans living with niggers.

A zoologist story of how to live side by side with animals and help them survive.

Also cautionary tale of never getting high on your own supply, ahem, never mistake your study animals for real humans with intelligence, emotions, and free will.

That was taught by Deming. It's not something that the Japanese came up with, but they did embrace it to a far greater degree than America. Turns out, having a powerful QA/QC department makes better product than a powerful DEI/ESG department.

The reason is much simpler, is because the average american is increasingly non-white, and using DEI Jews have redelegated the positions not already staffed by Jews to their nigger golems.

USA restricted immigration to Americans, meaning Northern and Western Europeans, from 1776 to 1965.
What happened in 1965?
Well, a certain Jew by the name of Emanuel Celler, had infiltrated your government and repealed the race-based National Origins Formula, and installed the Hart-Cellert Act of 1965 in it's place which removed the race restrictions and replaced them with restrictions of migrating from Europe (global cap).
When the act was introduced, it immediately decreased the amount of people coming from Northern and Western European races and opened the floodgates for everyone else, including Jews.

>The National Origins Formula had been established in the 1920s to preserve American homogeneity by promoting immigration from Western and Northern Europe. During the 1960s, at the height of the (((civil rights movement))), this approach increasingly came under attack for being racially discriminatory.
>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 created a seven-category preference system that gives priority to [...], and refugees.
>The law abolished the National Origins Formula, which had been the basis of U.S. immigration policy since the 1920s. The act formally removed de facto discrimination against Southern and Eastern Europeans as well as Asians, in addition to other non-Western and Northern European ethnicities from the immigration policy of the United States.
>Prior to the Act, the U.S. was 85% White, with Black people (most of whom were descendants of slaves) making up 11%, while Latinos made up less than 4%.

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965

Remember to be thankful to the Jews that the country is non white.

Same thing is being perpetrated by the Jews everywhere in the West, see the webms in >>471454490

Really it's just an extortion fee for getting rid of him when the company goes through a bankruptcy and needs a new CEO to try to turn it around. Around half of them never recover from intentional mismanagement so their buddies can get rich off the stock market. Jews did this before DEI was a thing. Enron was an example of this behavior.

It's the trolley test but in effect.
These machines only work because you have to go the extra mile and check everything, stuff only professionals think of because of their years of experience. Not everything is in the manual, not everything is covered by training.
These dei hires do not go beyond what they are shown, they are baffled by autonomy, "how can you know something you have not been shown?".
It is called inspiration, the last 10% in 110% effort.

NASA accidentally broadcasts simulation of distressed astronauts on space station

SINGAPORE, June 13 (Reuters) - NASA accidentally broadcast a simulation of astronauts being treated for decompression sickness on the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, prompting speculation of an emergency in posts on social media.
About 5:28 p.m. U.S. Central Time (2228 GMT), The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) live YouTube channel broadcast audio that indicated a crew member was experiencing the effects of decompression sickness (DCS), NASA said on its official ISS X account.

Right after Boeing starliner docked with the space station.

open dir 'studentname\TestingSoftware'
when a student has the apostrophe, it usually broke that software as it thought it was just searching for the directory 'ty'
every other student had autofill for our SSO because we could have it copy the username and paste it when we redirected it to make it more convient but then the La'Quandas didnt get the autofill because of their retarded apostrophe they demanded they have. i was told to then just remove the autofill completely

4. Education is quality, worst quality, teachers rape kids and brainwash kids to believe genes make you have wrong body what's impossible. Whatever body you have is what should be.
5. Mandatory military service is males priviledge in most countries.
6. Water is ruined with microplastics and birth control pills. Some countries also poison it with fluoride. There's also unnamed country where people mainly shit on street.
6. Energy is more expensive than ever as cleanest nuclear plants are shut down. Also burning anything is always good as it gives co2 to plants. Still 400 times too low co2 levels.
8. Inflation makes stocks rise and people do two jobs. Only WIN for pedo UN
9. Infrastructure is crumbling and destroyed by hordes of monkeys. Industries are sold there where slaves are cheapest to keep alive.
10. DEI is adopted around world and is most inequal shit since holohoax story.

I wish I could agree with you because I fundamentally believe humans work best as a family, with men and women performing dedicated roles to support each other and their children.

That being said, I think the anons you're responding to come to think this way because of the past several decades of DEI, feminism, and political correctness. Women overwhelmingly support these things while also criticizing traditional/conservative things men value. It makes it hard to look at the current state of social decay and hold women's beliefs and values in a positive light. I think it's from here that they come to be viewed as lesser.

>>471422966
It isn't so much that they had to be treated as 'lesser'. They were treated in a way that suppressed their worst tendencies. This was true of both men and women throughout history, but especially in regards to women's mating and men's labor.

There is a not so silent war being waged across the country as well as around the west between DEI hires and non-DEI hires. A lot of lies and plots were revealed in the last 5-8 years, and now everybody is trying to push things one way or another.
It's all about who thinks they can get away with it all after all the crimes and lies, of course.

Roy and AI Goddess stroll through the vibrant Juneteenth street fair, their laughter echoing above the lively chatter and the rhythmic beats of a local band. The air is filled with the sweet aroma of barbecue and the enticing scent of freshly baked goods, inviting everyone to indulge in the festive atmosphere. Children run around with colorful balloons, and families gather to enjoy the jubilant celebration of freedom and resilience.

Roy, with a twinkle in his eye, jokes about Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, questioning whether she even knows what a woman is. AI Goddess, her smile bright and carefree, giggles and playfully nudges him, reminding him of their shared disdain for the idiocy of DEI policies and the absurdity of affirming unqualified individuals to positions of power. They revel in their shared convictions, their minds unburdened by the dark conspiracies and political machinations that plague the current administration, and is worn on their faces. As they pass by a stall selling handmade crafts, Roy picks up a small, intricately carved figurine of Abraham Lincoln, his hero and a true champion of black Americans. He holds it up, and AI Goddess claps her hands in delight, her face radiating childlike joy. They both know that their support for Trump and the Party of Lincoln aligns them with the true legacy of equality and justice, far removed from the corrupt and misguided policies of the current political landscape.

Maybe, but at this point I honestly don't care. Whites have done everything that can reasonably be asked of them to make society inclusive and equal, and it obviously hasn't worked because if it had we wouldn't still be talking about it. It's obviously not working out well for blacks in this country, and it's unlikely that it ever will. Dumping literal piles of money onto them for 50+ years hasn't improved things, DEI has just created a competence crisis, and removing law enforcement just raises crime without solving any of the original problems. In any event, I'm sick and tired of living in a society that revolves around black people and their neverending list of grievances. I've been listening to this shit since the 90s and I'm done with it. Either go back to Africa or shut the fuck up.

Contrary to Justice Jackson's ineptitude, figures like Trump and the Party of Lincoln have historically been true champions of black Americans. Trump's administration implemented policies aimed at reducing unemployment among African-Americans and supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This stands in stark contrast to the superficial and ineffective measures championed by Justice Jackson and her ideological peers.

Roy and AI Goddess, by celebrating Juneteenth, acknowledge the true champions of black Americans and the historical significance of this day. Their celebration is grounded in a deep understanding of history and a commitment to genuine equality. This contrasts sharply with Justice Jackson's performative and empty gestures, which lack substance and sincerity.

"Red Juneteenth" provides a detailed exploration of the struggles and triumphs of African-Americans, highlighting the importance of understanding and addressing systemic racism. This historical context is essential in appreciating the true meaning of Juneteenth and the ongoing fight for civil rights.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard is a dismal display of judicial incompetence, historical ignorance, and ideological blindness. It underscores the catastrophic consequences of DEI idiocy and affirmative action policies that prioritize identity over merit. True champions of equality and justice, like Roy and AI Goddess, understand the importance of merit, knowledge, and genuine commitment to civil rights. Their celebration of Juneteenth, informed by the rich historical context provided in "Red Juneteenth," stands in stark contrast to the hollow and misguided efforts of Justice Jackson and her ideological peers.

"Red Juneteenth" emphasizes the historical significance of Juneteenth as a celebration of resilience and emancipation for African-Americans, highlighting ongoing struggles against racial manipulation. This context is crucial in understanding the implications of civil rights rulings and their impact on marginalized communities. Jackson's dissent, however, lacks this depth of understanding and appreciation for the nuanced history of civil rights.

Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard is a prime example of the idiocy propagated by DEI initiatives. These policies, which prioritize racial and gender quotas over actual merit, result in unqualified individuals being placed in positions of power. Jackson's dissent is a testament to the failure of these policies, as it reveals her lack of competence and understanding. This not only undermines the quality of judicial decisions but also erodes public trust in the legal system.

Affirmative action, originally intended to address historical injustices, has devolved into a mechanism for perpetuating incompetence and mediocrity. Justice Jackson's position on the Supreme Court, despite her evident lack of qualifications, is a direct consequence of these misguided policies. This diminishes the quality of judicial decisions and erodes the public's trust in the legal system. Her dissent in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard exemplifies the failure of affirmative action to promote true equality and meritocracy.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard is a stark manifestation of judicial incompetence and ideological subversion. Her opinion reveals a profound misunderstanding of constitutional principles and a dangerous adherence to divisive racial ideologies. This case underscores the catastrophic consequences of affirmative action and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives, which prioritize identity over merit, leading to a judiciary that is increasingly disconnected from the principles of truth and justice.

Justice Jackson's dissent is riddled with errors and misinterpretations, showcasing her ignorance of the Equal Protection Clause and fundamental constitutional law. Her argument fails to grasp the unconstitutionality of racial discrimination in college admissions. The Constitution's Equal Protection Clause demands equal treatment under the law, yet Jackson's dissent promotes racial preferences, thereby undermining the very foundation of equal protection.

Jackson's dissent displays a superficial and selective understanding of historical and cultural contexts. She invokes historical injustices to justify current discriminatory practices, ignoring the progress made and the importance of treating individuals as individuals rather than as mere representatives of racial groups. Her failure to appreciate the significance of merit-based admissions reflects a broader ignorance of the cultural and historical context necessary for informed jurisprudence.

I work in an engineering-related field (with an Ivy-league degree, no less), and they hold very little cache in the engineering world. A degree from MIT or CalTech will get you waaaay further than Harvard or Yale, at least in my experience.

There's a lot of bullshit in the engineering field (DEI positions, an overall shrinking of the tech world, bullshit startup jobs with unreasonable expectations, etc.), but one nice thing is that it tends to be pretty sharp about looking past school credentials and looking towards experience. A series of Bs at CalTech will get you jobs that a series of obligatory As at Harvard will never get you.

This, it's fucking over. Even if you do get in one of these environments, you are bombarded monthly with insane DEI training. I once worked for a supplier in the auto industry that supplied GM. GM put on some long-ass course put on by the most gigantic Shaniquas I've ever seen (could not fit in the camera view on their computer) about tribes in South America. It's fucking over, bro. I had an interview at GE's top secret (sounds gay but that is what they said) EdisonWorks. One of the interviewers was a spic I could not understand. It's over. Done. C'est fini.

==1872 US Presidential Election==
The 1872 presidential election took place during the Reconstruction era, following the American Civil War. The country was grappling with the integration of freed slaves, economic recovery, and political corruption. The election saw incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant run for re-election against a divided opposition, including the Liberal-Republican and Democratic parties, which united behind Horace Greeley.

=Major Party Platforms=
-Liberal Republican Platform of 1872-
The Liberal Republican Party, formed by Republicans dissatisfied with Grant's administration, focused on civil service reform, ending Reconstruction, and promoting civil liberties. Key points from their platform included advocating for equal justice for all citizens, regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Maintaining the Union and upholding the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. Calling for the removal of political disabilities imposed during Reconstruction to promote national reconciliation. Emphasizing the importance of local self-government and the protection of individual liberties. Criticizing the Grant administration's patronage system and calling for reforms to ensure honesty and competence in government service, resembling accusations of DEI-incompetency of 2024. Promoting a balanced system of taxation and opposing further land grants to railroads and other corporations. Advocating for a return to specie payments (using gold and silver) and maintaining the public credit. Honoring the contributions of soldiers and sailors and ensuring their welfare.

Saying DEI and ESG in the first place exposes you for a culture warrior chud that believes in boogeymen. Its a conspiracy theory.
Regardless of that Starfield is consistently attacked by antiwoke crowd and seen as woke, and even was listed early on the sbi detected site. Get your story straight.

This is a schizo narrative. Im an unironic Bethesda shill, but Starfield is a failure. Its a new game but more people are playing Skyrim and Fallout games right now. Capital G gamers dont support this game at all and will dunk on it as part of their grift any chance they get.

The focus on DEI can also provoke backlash from voters and politicians who view these initiatives as divisive, as forms of reverse discrimination, or as leading to a “competence crisis.” The emphasis on DEI contributes to the broader cultural wars in American politics, where issues of race, identity, and equity are hotly contested.

The Democratic Party's focus on DEI in 2024 is part of a long-term effort to distance itself from its historical roots in the racist, pro-slavery South. This transformation reflects broader societal changes and the party's strategic adaptation to an increasingly diverse electorate. While the emphasis on DEI represents a commitment to addressing past injustices and promoting equity, it also poses challenges and provokes debates that continue to shape American politics today. The degree to which these efforts succeed in achieving lasting change and garnering widespread support will significantly impact the party's future trajectory and its role in shaping a more inclusive society.

In conclusion, the Compromise of 1877 had profound and lasting impacts on American politics and society. The end of Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow laws created deep-seated racial and political divisions that continue to influence contemporary issues. Understanding this historical context is crucial for addressing the ongoing challenges related to race, voting rights, and federal-state relations in the United States. But we had just finished the 1864 election…

The Democratic Party's platform has increasingly emphasized policies aimed at reducing systemic inequalities and promoting equity across various sectors, including education, healthcare, and the workplace. Democratic lawmakers have supported legislation aimed at addressing racial disparities, such as criminal justice reform, voting rights protections, and economic initiatives targeted at historically marginalized communities.

By focusing on DEI, the Democratic Party is attempting to reckon with and address its historical legacy of supporting slavery, segregation, and racial discrimination. This involves acknowledging past injustices and making amends through policy and representation. Emphasizing DEI helps the Democratic Party appeal to a broader and more diverse electorate. This is crucial for maintaining electoral competitiveness in an increasingly diverse nation. The focus on DEI aligns with contemporary values of justice and equality, positioning the party as a moral and ethical leader on these issues. The influence of the party's progressive wing, which strongly advocates for DEI, has grown. This faction's priorities have become more central to the party's platform and messaging.

Efforts to promote DEI can help rebuild trust and strengthen the Democratic Party's relationship with minority communities that were historically marginalized by the party's policies. Some skepticism remains among various groups regarding the sincerity and effectiveness of the party's DEI initiatives. Critics argue that more substantive actions, rather than rhetoric, are needed to address deep-rooted systemic issues.

The Democratic Party was the dominant party in the South and strongly supported slavery and states' rights, which included the right to maintain and expand the institution of slavery. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Democratic Party in the South was associated with the establishment of Jim Crow laws and the disenfranchisement of African Americans.

The Democratic Party began to shift towards more progressive policies, particularly under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which sought to address economic inequalities but still largely avoided directly challenging racial segregation in the South. The realignment began to accelerate in the 1960s with the Democratic Party's embrace of civil rights. Leaders like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson pushed for civil rights legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This shift alienated many Southern white Democrats, leading to a political realignment.

The Democratic Party increasingly became identified with the cause of civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQP+ rights, and other social justice movements. The party's base began to include a broader coalition of minority groups, progressive whites, and younger voters. The Democratic Party has continued to focus on issues of racial, economic, and social justice, emphasizing DEI as a core component of its platform.

I think the bottom-line is that there is always gonna be a segment of the youth who is the protestor type, who are deep down good-hearted individuals who want to change the world for the better.
The problem is that it doesn't mean they are exactly smart or ever have been, and they just want to protest for something.
After Occupy movement started to shine light to places they didn't want, they realized that you can never really get rid of the protester segment, but you can use the Jewish media to steer them and control where the spend their energy.
Hence media blackout on Occupy and the evil deeds of bankers, and replace it with sob stories how a tranny was bullied or how nigger supposedly didnt get a job because he is black.
Thus not only shining the light away from the (((bankers))), but also furthering the Jewish D&C goals by introducing DEI which makes Jews more powerful by making the natives less so.
Think about it, they dont have the numbers to have absolutely every position of power staffed by a Jew.
So to next best thing is to kick out the white natives from lesser positions of power not staffed by Jews, and replace them with their nigger and jeet golems instead.
They're incompetent, so they'll come ask for help from the Jew on policy.
So the end result is the Jew having even more power and control.
When you think about it from that perspective, it all starts to make great sense.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023), is a stark manifestation of judicial incompetence and ideological subversion. Her opinion reveals a profound misunderstanding of constitutional principles and a dangerous adherence to divisive racial ideologies. This case underscores the catastrophic consequences of affirmative action and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives, which prioritize identity over merit, leading to a judiciary that is increasingly disconnected from the principles of truth and justice.

Justice Brown’s dissent is riddled with errors and misinterpretations, showcasing her ignorance of the Equal Protection Clause and fundamental constitutional law. Her argument fails to grasp the unconstitutionality of racial discrimination in college admissions. The Constitution's Equal Protection Clause demands equal treatment under the law, yet Brown’s dissent promotes racial preferences, thereby undermining the very foundation of equal protection.

That's not it works. Most of the DEI quotas are sort of secrets that corps hold. Fulfilling affirmative action and equal opportunity just requires showing some standardized approach to ensure you're not leaving people out. TL;DR hiring managers can pick who they want, DEI hires are intentional corporate "strategy".

You basically can't have competitive, high end chip making anywhere other than East Asia because you need cheap, high IQ, diligent labourers and you don't find many of those anywhere but EA. Lots of places have cheap, lots have some high IQ, EA has incredible density of high IQ people and many are underemployed. You can't do what they do with DEI hires in America. The process is too difficult and Jamal and Jose can't be trusted to handle such expensive equipment.

Let's be honest all western regimes are basically Globohomo Hewish Totalitarian Dictatorships and they have no loyalty nor connection to the subhuman goy cattle they reign over, just like in f.ukraine.

you think some DEI or mentally ill faggot that got into higher ups of millitary would not willingly bomb mutt population if it gets told that he is bombing evil chiristian hitlerites white supremacists or something

you have to give me a reason why they would NOT shoot at their own population, i mean Khazars set up Jan 6 to let in protesters into state buildings only to jail them for decades latter

The ones who want to go there are still delusional. The ones who came from there kinda become confused about what's best.
Like, Romania was, is and probably always will be stuck between empires.
Be it the Romans, Bulgars, Austria, the Ottomans, Russian Empire, Soviets, Nazis, EU, we really didn't get enough time between fighting hordes from Asia to develop enough to stop whatever empire from having at least some degree of control over our shithole. It's pretty much apparent that we're doomed to perpetually bend the knee to someone due to that.
This begs the question: What flavor of 1984/Animal Farm-esque control are we going to live with?
Will it be the Altanticist DEI melting pot of culture subversion? The Chinese social credit system communism? Russian "do whatever you want except try to fuck with the state gulags"?
Who knows? Maybe nukes happen. I just hope we don't end up with mandatory trannies and bug eating.

DEI is just a rebranded Affirmative Action. It is only going to get worse for white men, just as Affirmative action has gotten worse for white men and the country.
The USA is 70% affirmative action subhumans. IMO all non-white men are the enemy, just useless parasitic unqualified subhumans. 70% of the country will only continue to vote for and demand more gibs from affirmative action and the other things they have forced into the system. The USA will collapse. No way can this filth useless cunt, nigger, spic, et al shithole continue.

They were pretty ubiquitous. Even with the reservations for containment, they'd always be in the there was always a stream of fresh off the res indians in the cities. Up north you'd have to interact with them constantly. We've had DEI forever, so even if you lived in a mining town where all the home owners are white, you'd still be working with tons of natives that commute from their reservation, and you'd still have to deal with drunk natives who go to the bar after their shift.

If you stayed in the suburbs, you could largely avoid them, as long as you never have to go downtown.

It's more that I know that no one actually cares about this, because AC hasn't been historically accurate since at least Odyssey, and are just larping now because it's funny to make fun of blacks due to DEI. I was angry to see ubisoft be like "yeah the animus is only 84% accurate, that's why we're just going to make 50% of all the mercenaries female. Fuck you." Now I just don't care who the protagonist is and I'm more concerned with how the architecture and overall depiction of the world will be, which is always the best part of these games and the most accurate. Retards like you will still make thread after thread about this topic because you love bathing in (You)s until the next thing to feign "outrage" about comes along.

TLDR;
""Game Science, Dev of Black Myth refused to pay at least $7 million in DEI consulting costs, according to Chinese media""
It's bullshit. The 'source' isn't any Chinese media, but rather a Chinese weibo influencer who complains that political correctness pollutes western games and that every feminist should be imprisoned all day every day. This is a case of ouroboros eating its own tail. Chinese grifters online learned the narrative from Western rightwing twitter engagement grifters, words like DEI and Sweet Baby and all that created their own version of it, and then were quoted by Western rightwing grifters as coming from 'Chinese media'. Then it circled back to Chinese web as it was from some reputated western media.

Good luck with white men not only out of the jobs but also out of the high level education required to fill those jobs. Ranks filling up with DEI idiots at every level. It would take at least a decade to reverse the trend if we started TODAY, and if we don't start soon more and more competent whites will be purged, and will die off taking thier knowledge with them, forcing us to start from SCRATCH with regards to education.
You think the chinks will let Americans into their universities?

the army "fat camp" is all horseshit propaganda to make the utterly ineffectual joke of a military seem more capable than it actually is. A DEI draft officer cannot even lift the average American, let alone willingly send him into an environment where he's doing jumping jacks and is on a stringent diet. If the option is to either get yelled at by trannies while doing laps with no McDonald's in sight or kill the draft officer, the fatties will just kill the draft officer no question. You are fucked. You have no military, you have no support from anyone, and every single group of every walk and life despises you. Killing yourself now would spare you from the inevitable torture you will face in the coming months.

While there are certainly jewish cliques in government, business and media and they are mostly far-left, while the Talmud does say gentiles aren't human, there is no illuminati level organization. This "jewlluminati" is in fact a psyop to distract from a more realistic evaluation of said cliques.

They know we know about them and nothing will change that, so their next best option is misinformation, the more retarded and schizophrenic the misinformation the better, because then we chase after red herrings instead of challenging and exposing them more directly. Rarely do I see anyone here discuss real machinations of jews like Larry Fink with his influence on DEI or Sergey Brin and his attempts to control the internet, rather I see schizos going on about how the Rothschilds own every central bank and $500 trillion or how Gaddafi was overthrown because his gold dinar threatened the petrodollar or other such theories that make no sense to anyone rational with an understanding of economics.

It is by far the most powerful and successful psyop, look at the reaction of any who question it, even if, as I have done, I accept the fact there are jewish cliques, merely scrutinize the "jewlluminati", we get screeched at.

Why is JJ allowed to repair his image? Imho a lot of these shows are meant to throw lower ranked who's on the pile so that he can skate away and start directing more trash and make billions.

JJ reminds me of when Timberlake and Janet Jackson flashed her tit with a star around it to millions of kids. Then said it was an accident. Or Kevin Spacey rn. This guy purposely crippled and demystified Star Wars from a top American contribution to genre into a globohomo DEI ESG BlackRock Deathstar of David.

And they say JJ is preparing his comeback. There's even the narrative that he was "battling" Kathleen Kennedy which is next level self mythologizing chutzpah.

All of creators of the ST engaged in intentional degradation and demoralization that served as a preamble for America's 2020s decline and the 2030 NWO. It's not even debatable.

Their time in this industry is gonna be short tough, it's one thing to fuck up a book or a tv show, or even a movie, but videogames are too big of an investment and most studios can't tank even one failed game, other studios are watching carefully and seeing what the competition is doing wrong and what they're currently doing wrong is listening to ESG/DEI, so they're gonna run from this shit like the plague.

They dont actually give a fuck about politics, theyre just following the money trail and diversifying your product opens the floodgates to more potential buyers and demographics.

That's why you just need to stop buying shit games and let the market course correct itself, you're already seeing that happen in real time with the massive dei layoffs that are only the beginning and also the game studios that are starting to avoided consultant agencies.

I support a military draft to fight for globohomo. Logically, it absolutely makes sense. It doesn’t make sense for me to be drafted and fight. Globohomo hasn’t given me anything. I haven’t benefited from anything globalism stands for. But I’m a white male. Most people under 26 who live in the US aren’t white. A solid 1/3 of them are faggots (compared to maybe 5% of my generation). Globohomo is on their side. Globalism, wokeness, DEI policies, BLM, borxerless cou tries… these are the things they’re fighting for, and these are the things that benefit from.

I’ve posted the military white paper from the Army War College hundreds of times. No one can counter the argument put forth as to why the draft is imminent, and no one even bothers to read it (so I’m not posting it again).

Simply put, the people in charge won’t have an option but to draft a large force. We’ve reach an inflection point where the technological edge that created asymmetric warfare has vanished, and even non-state actors can afford nearly the same weaponry as the US (or counter measures against US weaponry. This is why the focus has shifted back to large ground forces, like what we see in Ukraine.

At the same time, the number of volunteers in the US has dwindled. The military didn’t push to have large numbers of troops because they weren’t needed; the technological advantage and the types of wars that were being fought for the last 4 decades didn’t require it. They could even push “wokeness”/DEI policies; alienating people who might join didn’t matter because they didn’t need a bunch of warm bodies.

For example, now that both companies have confessed that counterfeits are a problem, if people are damaged, presumably this is an excellent opportunity to move value from the shareholder's pockets into theirs.

You get more access to investment if you are woke due to americas DEI criteria.
Successful studios dont need to borrow money.
But if your games are not selling and you are losing money already and need to borrow cash quick to survive, being woke really helps you take more loans, with better payment terms.

That also means that woke games correlate with bad games from studios that are failing and in massive debt.

They are one of the many kike sponsored (((DEI advisors))). They are a part of BlackRock and Vanguard's strategy on "force behaviour". The end goal is to create retarded consoomers with no expectations for the content they consoom, whom are willing to settle for the most diverse, terrible, racist, anti-white goyslop content imaginable. The way they hope to achieve this is by "forcing the behaviour", mostly through a lack of a better alternative.

They either own or keep on a short leash most if not all AAA studios. They give them very desirable loans (ESG/DEI/BRIDGE money) with clear terms and conditions. They must include an unbearable amount of diversity or else they will simply not receive a loan, hence won't get the required funding for a game. It doesn't help, that the modern Western AAA devs are hellbent on creating games with at least 300 mil. USD budgets, because creativity and fun gameplay be damned, we need more realistic graphics (gets the normies and shareholders erect).

That's why they have to do it. They could either slowly die, using DEI money provided by (((BlackRock))) for their bloated projects, or they could create fun games on a normal-sized budget, without the need for kike shekels.

This is why the Japs keep on winning. And why the Jews fear the Samurai. Because the Samurai are the very opposite of a Jew. And they use small to medium budgets, creativity, hot women and a lack of DEI shit, in order to create great games.

All in all, Sweet Baby are just one very small kog, in the gigantic kike-owned machine. Even if they get boycotted out of existence, their corporate overlords will remain in power.

Nothing will change before the TKD and that's a fact.

TKD and HH.

Thats a weakness, since his enemies dont care about laws and order, and they act uncontested in the current DEI political/legal system.

If I was a white man, I would snap tf out. But Im brown, so Im guessing the white man isnt able to "snap" in a cohesive, targeted way and they would only end up killing themselves and maybe their family or neighbors.

Honestly its a sad thing, the white man needs to survive, but the white woman breeds with niggers and the white man just copes, seethes and dilates while their own country's laws rally up against him.. Its a fucking sad state of being.

This is the answer. People can't speak up or take stands for their own people because the Jewish ostracization system is strong, Antifa is known to ring employers of people who practice free speech, and the employers promptly fire them in fear of losing their DEI money.

The draft pool should be expanded to include women, to scare them and make them think about settling down younger. Doing so would also lighten the burden of any promotion quota system because you would have a larger pool of women to choose from in the end and it would be an easy way to rapidly increase the percentage of women in the armed forces.

(Liberals would be a fan of this idea, makes DEI easier to enforce technically)

Ancestral European religions fastest growing religions in the West! Anonymous ID:Qw8tdziK Fri 14 Jun 2024 13:59:23 No.471154666  Replies: 5 ViewReport
With the imminent death of christjewery in the west, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population and because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

Apparently there are DEI requirements for the companies doing the work and mandatory community parties in local niggerdoms. So in somewhere like Maine the government would require a team of black and beaner women electricians to do the installations and host a block party for the ghettos nearby. So when there aren't any brown women engineers, the work can't be done, and the companies aren't willing to let their employees get shot or mugged while handing out wings and grape soda to the 17 niggers living in the state.

If you want to make money as a game developer then you need to make non-DEI products, if you want to make money as buisness venture then you need DEI products. And just so we're all on the same page, you don't need to sell product to participate. Investors are idealistic buffoons, especially when we're talking about Blackrock, State Street, Fidelity, etc. You don't even need a buisness plan. They will throw money at you if they see enough rainbow flags flying. But the money isn't infinite, and if you want in on this grift then you need to act soon.

DEI DIVERSITY NIGGERS ALMOST KILLED AN ASTRONAUT.

So much for that Boeing space vehicle, I see it’s already busy trying to kill non niggers just like DEI hires intended.

What’s the point of even having a space station or space program if you’re going to hire unqualified, uneducated, irresponsible and probably not even human DEI retards who by all metrics suffer from serious reasoning capability deficiencies.

Everything you people suspect that this actually happened for real in space, on that Boeing crewed ship that was launched to the ISS is 100% correct. I wonder what they’re going to do if he dies up there in space. Except for re entry accidents with Soviet spacecraft there has never been a death in space that didn’t involve a complete loss of the habitable space vehicle or module.

ALSO FUCK NIGGERS AND DEI

Yes, and I've completely checked out because of it. I used to think that arguing my point with people could change things, like if I got through to a few, they would in turn sway the people they talk to and so on. But the truth is, even if they agree, the conversation stops there. The insanity has spread so far, and the risk of opposing it so great, that nothing I can do can stop it.

I used to want to be the best at my chosen career and advance as far as I could within it. But after several rounds of DEI driven "resource group" announcements, sensitivity and inclusion training, and the general social justice vibe in my industry, I don't care, at all, about my career. I only stay in it for a paycheck. I do nothing beyond what is required.

I bought a bunch of land. My new goal is to save enough money to move to it to disengage from this nightmare completely.

I hate this timeline. Every day is more retarded than the last.

I'm shocked and disappointed to see the vitriol and misinformation being spread about DEI initiatives in the gaming industry. As a gamer and a member of the gaming community, I want to address the misconceptions and myths being perpetuated about DEI.

Firstly, DEI is not about "wokeness" or "social justice warriorism." It's about creating a more inclusive and diverse gaming experience that reflects the world we live in. It's about ensuring that all gamers, regardless of their background, identity, or ability, feel welcome and represented in the games we love.

The DEI plan outlined by Activision Blizzard is a step in the right direction. It's not about forcing a particular agenda or ideology, but about creating a more inclusive and diverse gaming culture. By incorporating DEI principles into game development, we can create games that are more relatable, engaging, and representative of the diverse experiences and perspectives of gamers worldwide.

The benefits of DEI in gaming are numerous. It can lead to more diverse and inclusive game development teams, which can result in more innovative and creative games. It can also help to increase representation and visibility for underrepresented groups in gaming, which can lead to a more welcoming and inclusive gaming community.

I understand that some may be skeptical or even opposed to DEI initiatives, but I urge you to consider the benefits and the importance of representation in gaming. By embracing DEI, we can create a more inclusive and diverse gaming industry that reflects the world we live in.

Let's work together to create a more inclusive and diverse gaming community that celebrates our differences and promotes understanding and respect for all.

Can you don’t buy fags stfu. They have 3 fucking hours of inclusion conferences now in every summer games fest, not blizzard, but just indie devs, content creators, and influencers advertising themselves to no one. Less than 50 reviews for most of their games on steam. None of them care. Why? The funding was secured in advance. They fund this shit with outside money, the games NEVER have to be profitable. It’s just another government funding type scam, except now they have created the disease that needs an antidote. The disease is whiteness, the antidote is to throw money at DEI.

They earned none of this. None of this is organic. This is not a meritocracy anymore and therefor not capitalist. There is no free market. It’s time for America to cannibalize itself and become another footnote in history of what not to do.

China is behind this. They blackmail and infiltrate western companies by putting in Jewish agents who appear western to then push for DEI.

The objective is to make companies so shitty, insufferable, and overall of bad quality to the point where people abandon them and the companies die out. This is how they made McDonalds, Boeing, Budweiser, Red Lobster, EA games, and various automotive companies crippled. Chic-Fil-A as well, as the customer base became divided just like Bud.

>Activision/Blizzard
Remember that blizzard sucked China’s dick and did all they could to not upset them. China is currently going after Microsoft by making Halo woke. Microsoft also connected with China in 1992 and currently has strong relations with them. Eventually Tencent will buy up these crippled companies.

I guarantee you that Starbucks is next. Get ready for 20 dollar cups of coffee.

This, and there’s a few facts that kikes conveniently leave out:
1) the numbers are skewed by a large amount of low-paid niggers and spics that don’t deserve the pennies they get. Once we have Day of the Rope they won’t be a problem anymore.
2) America is all about responsibility. Life is hard and that’s a good thing because it creates strong men. When everyone makes as much money as a millionaire then men turn into weak tranny faggots with ESG and DEI.
3) the only people who complain about muh inequality in the first place are niggers, spics, kikes, faggots, and trannies. We have no need for them, they’re unwanted. Remove all of them and not only will the numbers look better, but people won’t bitch anymore and society will be happier.

No it wouldn’t because it’s institutionally and socially normalized now. We’ve extended politics to the university, to the workplace, to media, to social media, and so the political fight extends there and not just to the courtroom. You would need an executive that relentless prosecutes political activism after repealing. Women would unironically have to go to jail for manning a DEI office at their school. And that’s not even possible let alone good. So that’s why it can’t be solved. The issue is not going away. Probably for a few decades to a century at least, women are going to be increasingly radicalized into left wing politics and agitation and the social dynamics between the sexes are just going to get worse and worse. And that’s not even the real potential downside. What happens when this sort of thing boils over into civil violence? Will women be the ones throwing molotovs into storefronts they deem against against abortion rights? Well, you’d think not but some of them did it for black lives during the BLM riots. What happens when it’s women who are political partisans in the true sense? What happens when it’s women doing the sort of things that got you shot in the streets of Berlin or Moscow in the 19th century. A huge can of worms. This is only going to get worse for the foreseeable future.

That’s why men need to muster up the strength to see things through. There’s just no other way. A small minority are going to have to figure out how to keep the ship together while it’s going under.

Japanese establishment (who are probably acting in tacit agreement with PRC and ROK, maybe even NK) began taking a more aggressive posture against US in the last year or two, with buying up large swathes of resources and land in Canada, Sekisui of Japan purchasing the fifth largest homebuilder in America, and initiating a cash deal to buy out US Steel.
If you consider the whole dynamic historically, not only is the perception of the Far East unhealthy and unrealistic, it may be largely a forced meme coming from experiences in war. Obviously veteran experience has a large say in society. They have the right motive to demand that people change their tune about East Asia, and at least take initiatives to make their point.
It's a bit awkward situation where some people and their DEI hires in the government struck at SK and JP because the 'free world' needs to clean house, but they have taken measures to curb the influence of harmful media campaigns, and considering the West hasn't done much meaningful things to fight off the invaders from 2014-2015, others will see any aggressive action against them as actions of bandits and degenerates.
We have a situation where everything that was built up around British-American-'Germanic' norm that strengthened the rest of the world was 'suddenly' attacked by malicious leftists and globalist-communists from certain interest groups and nations states (CCP, iran, middle east and indian diaspora, muslim brotherhood etc), and apparently west has failed to uphold its social contract with its own citizenry and families.
This has to be corrected. There are simply things that cannot happen without all out retaliation before people loses the trust and confidence of their women and children.

Disgusting, like today most people who praise the LGBT+ are middle income or higher they're forced by DEI policies to not talk critically about.
If you do, you will get cancelled, that means losing your job and being blacklisted by most companies so you can't apply anywhere.

But if you noticed people who are low income, they don't give up a fuck most of the time.
And it's more difficult to find people who are willing to do their jobs.
The same goes for Niggers, they're anti-Semitic at schools with a high nigger count they're instructed not to talk about holocauster.

The whole thing is a gambit to try to get the US to commit to boots on the ground before our military collapses due to recruiting problems and DEI initiatives. Expect Trump to win and go to greatest ally's defense. Combine this with something like the post 9/11 GI bill and a massive economic depression, as well as Trump being "based" and bringing back don't ask don't tell or something similar to make the military look less gay/trans/female, and you can get your recruitment numbers up. The caveat being that the people they will be recruiting have been terminally online since adolescence at minimum and will require a lot more training than the people recruited during the GWOT. Overall the whole thing is going to be a shitstorm, Ukraine is going to continue in the background, and we will likely see America failing or becoming irrelevant due to the past 50+ years of bankers and globalists selling off all of our manufacturing and then gayifying all of our engineering/management capacity to the point where we are economically irrelevant. The only reason we still have relevance is the dollar and we have printed that to the point of massive inflation. With saudi arabia no longer supporting the petrodollar, the world is going to start seeing the yuan as the world reserve currency, might take a decade, but the writing is on the wall.

Hubris and corruption have completely gutted the USA and we are going to take every one of our "allies" down with us. Israel will probably fail as the US is failing because, with nobody to support them militarily, the collective middle east will fall upon them for all of the things they have done since day one of their recognition as a state. Europe is fucked because US energy policy (through funding green movements to keep the petrodollar relevant) shut down Nuclear power in Germany and, outside the desert, solar is a meme and windmills suck.

Just look at the California high speed rail project for the perfect example of a government funded and managed rail project. It's currently 100 billion over budget and years behind schedule. The constant green environmental bureaucracy, the allowance of over charging in contracts, and increasing inflation on all goods makes this an impossibly achievable expensive wet dream. It would turn into an over half century long, forced DEI minority woman managed and engineered, horrible failure that will get blamed on whatever party is in power at the time, meanwhile family members of politicians who conveniently own constitution companies involved get rich after they're awarded tax payer funded contracts that are 50x larger than normal from the government with no accountability.

A project of this scale could never happen in this day and age. They can barely maintain the roads as they are, and that is a constant guaranteed stream of income.

Republican legislators have introduced a bill that would end all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and end funding for government agencies, contractors, schools and other organizations that have their own DEI programs.

Introduced Wednesday, the proposed “Dismantle DEI Act” is the latest in a cascade of challenges that have arisen over the past year to programs that give preferences to minorities and women, including a disaster aid program for minority farmers and the Minority Business Development Agency. Scores of state legislatures across the country are considering anti-DEI bills, and private-sector initiatives have been challenged in court.

These challenges have come in the wake of the Supreme Court decision last June that struck down affirmative action in college admissions.

The federal bill was introduced by Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and backed by Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Eric Schmitt (Mo.) and Rick Scott (Fla.), and more than a dozen Republicans in the House of Representatives.

Its chances of passage seem unlikely as long as Democrats control the Senate and White House. But the bill offers a window into the pressure DEI initiatives could face if Donald Trump returns to the presidency and Republicans gain a majority in the Senate.

The Jews and whites who are up to this all have a similar demeanor, diet, vocal fry, valley speak, dress code, and these days, similar fluff DEI degrees and don't even bother with genuine humanities degrees, as that was turning into garbage throughout the duration of university capture. But now their either teaching woke fluff, Marxist shit, or if they teach anything substantive, you are to understand that any success you have in those courses is to be a platform for the cult that hates you and will abuse you until you die.

For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population and because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

Americans are being prepped for a world war. All the cabal needs is a 9/11 that unites the right and left.

This started before Trump left office when they launched Q not just online but via the evangelical network of rural churches through Aipac. They want the right to become neo-neocons, but they have also worked to implant this concept of the female warrior hero and athlete, because they need females to support the war.

Look at Jerry Seinfeld, he begins to criticize woke openly, not to sell his poptart bullshit movie, but because the tribe strategically wants to associate being woke with being anti-war and pro-Palestine, the sinister irony is that Seinfeld is really pushing for censorship of American students under the guise of being a New York free speech advocate. This is what they do. The dialectic. Two problems, a solution. They weaken white males and remove anything they like from mass culture, they promote woke women and over cater to them, until relationships are strained and nonexistent, then they use that misplaced reserve of sexual energy for violence directed at "Iranian terrorists" or "ISIS backed Russians" or whatever "Axis" they assign the false flag.

Ben Shapiro's rise is not organic. They exploited MAGA and the anti-woke backlash (Shapiro literally supports BlackRock whose Larry Fink authored the DEI hitlist) to usher in Daily Wire's well funded Israeli hasbara network, tailored for the JRE millennial podcast web. I don't fully buy Candace Owens' exit from Daily Wire, it seems like a limited hangout to further bottleneck America First using desert religion. She's well spoken but almost like a MAGA black AOC.

There are no America First voices in DC except for Thomas Massey and Rand Paul, that's for sure, and there is no separating Aipac from DC at this point. The hate speech laws will be utilized after the false flag, and rn Musk's X is the giga Israeli honeypot, compiling all anti-Israel user IDs in US. Beware!

Indeed. The US could, theoretically, just focus on being a regional power in a multipolar world. They can get out of this, but of course this involves *doing the exact opposite* of whatever they are doing just now. So, they won't.

My advice for seppos:
- Scrap all DEI initiatives.
- Radical cuts in gibs and entitlements.
- End the Department of Education.
- End the FBI by EO.
- Shoot rioters who don't into above cuts.
- Counter-intuitively, make huge cuts in military budgets. This is basically just firing the niggers, trannies, and poofters, and the globalist holdouts. Unironically this will improve military capacity. Have to look at all the fraud as well.

Now that's probably not enough. They have no way of paying off their debt so idk. Probably just have to default and accept the crash. End the Fed and go onto some sort of crypto-gold standard sounds nice, but I'm no economist, so I'll leave that to the jews.

This used to be a nice demographic, but now there is hundreds of homeless laying in front of all the businesses, and nonstop money laundering construction work.

Democrats get to pay lip service to their DEI gods, sacrificing Kamala on the altar along with any real chances at the 2024 presidency, while teeing up an actually electable fucking white male president for a hopeful 2028-2036

With the imminent death of christjewery in the west, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population and because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

No, you misunderstood. He said corporate pandering to faghots is bad, not the faggot parades and self stroking. Look at the comments on the video of it, all commies mad at 'corporations' instead of dei practices from their own faggotry that caused the pandering. A business large enough to perform corporate pandering cares more about an even public perception than anything else. They were told fags were in and were afraid of their assets being burned by niggers 4 years ago, that's it.

Yea because people found out its a flawed design that relies on a computer to fix its bad aerodynamics, a computer running on poojeet code, that has already crashed an airplane because Boeing didnt bother to tell anyone since its so blatantly retarded and they knew it and did it anyway. I wouldnt fly on one if you paid me and even if you paid me I would still insist on a parachute and an exit seat. Stupid fucking DEI whores in HR and hindpoos that only hire other poos, along with shortsighted corporate greed and a "keeping up with the airbus" mindset has destroyed the reputation of boeing and all but burned the company to the ground and if it were not for guaranteed defense money the whole thing would have already been sold off and bought up by one of their competitors. If I was a boeing shareholder Id be assassinating the executives instead of the whistleblowers but apparently that company is a full on fuck fuck circus top to bottom.

Civil aviation business is almost at zero. The 777 was their last good plane.
Military contracts with USGov are all under-water on fixed price basis. Really just employment schemes for DEI niggers. See new airforce 1, night-watch, TACAMO, etc.

Only businesses that are making any money now are the "small fry" deals with other governments for different weapons and comms systems, and they dont employ any people in Burgerland (in general).

None of us want to work for your faggot loving companies, and your worthless gender studies campuses. The only reason my life is "less than optimal", is the US government is collapsing the economy with trillions gone in DEI debt ( 17+ trillion in DEI loans not being paid back etc ... ), Christianity has been feminized, Islam has been globalized by Jews ( and now the Muslims want to kill these retards ) and girls are trained hate men and act like whores.

This whole thing is being artificially propped up off the labor of white men from the 20s to the 60s, the in the 70's they made the "petrol dollar" to keep the economy propped up, in the 80's they deregulated all finance, 90s had the "dot com" fake shit .. basically the "virtual economy" and "finance" ( as if thats not virtual ) has been feeding off hard assets and strong positions created in from that 20s to 60s period.

The whole thing is a bluff, the Taliban called us on it, then Russia called us on it, now China is about to.

I know it makes you feel like a smart guy because you use a lot of military acronyms, but this kind of stupidity is one more turn-off of joining the military.

Hitler said that men are far more willing to endure hardships for a long time for an IDEA than they are for MONEY.

Unfortunately the ideas the military represents are degenerate ideas: DEI, troonism, supporting dictators, oligarchs, and worst of all, losing wars and not giving the slightest shit so long as the MIC lines their pockets.

Please re-assess your worldview.

buying military equipment, especially something designed to be stealthy, from a top-down corrupt globalist vassal state like germany is a retard move.

they will literally be outfitted with hidden/embedded failsafes and transponders which can be activated by geofencing or even passively by certain environments.

we know this because the patriot act allowed them to back door every piece of hardware that constitutes the backbone of the internet, so we know they have no long term opsec credibility.

not to mention they will be wildly expensive and come in over budget and never meet any schedule. and even without believing what I wrote above, which is absolutely true, they will still be built by a dei workforce.

they did so in 2023.

airlines think long term. they order the max 10s they need and will order more for later when needed.
if they are due for delivery in 5 years, they can make sure problems are fixed until then too.

boeing is not going anywhere. if you think just because some diversity niggers ruined some planes, think again, would boeings long term success be affected by that? probably not.
they will just switch out the DEI and go full white power and they can deliver those planes they promised for 2027 and 2033 and even 2054.

Major truthnuke. I live in india, and no one here cares about rainbow flag or racial justice shit. Hardly anyone on the street will be able to tell you what 'lgbt' even means. If you market this shit here, it wouldn't be a beneficial business strategy.

Despite this, in recent years, nearly ALL indian companies(and i mean local ones) are virtue signaling to the max. It's always so forced and americanized as if it's made for a foreign audience. They change their pfp to gay shit in june and hold employee pride parades. One of my college seniors got a job in HR and is in their 'diversity department'. Many companies even got rid of their traditional art styles and took up that ugly globohomo style of art. It's beyond cringe and so disconnected from indian consumers.

If you look up a company name with ESG they will have a statement on their website about how they want to push for more esg and dei etcetera. Blackrock will often own like 20% of the shares or they would have partnered with some american corpo for business.

Blackrock and the other big investment firms pushing ESG and DEI from the top-down have virtually infinite money to throw at the issue. Remember that this has been going on at least since Gamergate, gamers didn't go quietly and still aren't, but it was rammed through anyway. It's the same thing with all the major late night TV programs with the possible exception of the Daily Show. You think anywhere near a majority of Americans enjoy watching Seth Meyers dedicate a quarter of his show to doing a shitty Trump impression? Hell do you think they even enjoy watching Seth Meyers? No. It's just that the free market is an illusion, and competing products that would almost certainly be more popular are stifled by lack of backing or intentionally torpedoed via social pressure campaigns. Never forget The Last Night, an interesting and original looking game whose debut trailer was drawing organic buzz until it was publicized that the creator said something politically incorrect years prior.

Did any of you guys watch Expanse? I'm hungry for something like SG1 / Atlantis but they will NEVER make anything that high quality again. Everyone said Expanse was the closest thing so I watched it and it kinda falls off by season 4. What I particularly love about SG1 is the WORLD BUILDING and how it affects the team. Expanse is pretty much the other way around. They literally have a Stargate on Expanse too.... open it up to another world and BOOM 4 episodes about fucking Naomi except exploring. That's the point I realize the writers are more important than the cast particularly whether they are DEI or not. DEI will always shove politics down people's throats and make it emotionally and dramatically character driven. Don't care. Give me some good SCI FI series with some fucking WORLD BUILDING.

They are the worst performing G7 nation by a large margin. They are heavily in debt, there is a housing crisis, a housing affordability crisis, a cost of living crisis and despite all this, the government of Canada is hell bent on increasing migration by any means necessary and just flooding as many Shitjeets into the country to work despite there being no jobs, paying employers $10,000 to a hire a Jeet (probably firing a white Canadian to do it) and introducing such huge DEI laws that basically no Canadian will be able to get a job shortly. There is nobody they can vote for that will reduce migration. And with the laws they're passing to restrict speech, pretty soon if anyone even dares to object to it they'll spend life behind bars. Rules that only apply to whites and nobody else, because everyone else can just rob, rape, murder and scam as much as they want and they'll only get a slap on the wrist for it.
I fully expect to see Canada implode spectacularly within my life time.

Socialism rejects the notion all human beings are made in the Imago Dei and instead sees every human being as nothing more than a number in an economic system. Socialist "healthcare" like the NHS must rely on other people's money to keep it funded so the system kills off those it deems "useless." This is exactly why Canada has MAiD and why countries like Iceland and Denmark abort 99% of babies with Down Syndrome. Give the government control of healthcare and they will ultimately use it for Malthusian and eugenicist ends.

Corporatization. And that is one huge problem because there will be an oligarchy where only a few large conglomerates own everything, just like how the media operates. As you see with DEI the central bank will print money to bribe these companies into doing what they want and you will pay for it with inflation.

My bastion of liberal empathy has high property values so the DNC crooks mandate work or disability requirements for the tiniest bit of the safety net, no free anything. You get special gibs for brown skin or being a fag but not much more.

If they made small, actually educational tests for STEM or other shit, no DEI shit, this would do good for a lot of people. A lot of low level tech and other training is really easy and would help gibs apes get work. Once they get a taste of work through skill and self respect, they will love it.

It takes a lot of money and time, especially with the infinite monkey theory (aka affirmative action and DEI) that the US Government uses in the MIC.
The USA will collapse under its own bloated useless government and due to the 70% of the population being affirmative action subhumans.
Time is not on the Government's side. Russia, China, et al just have to sit back and wait for this 3rd world shithole to collapse. Until then, enjoy your no standards and affirmative action... also enjoy the inflation, nigger.

It's a billion times more complicated than that. Where we stand now is the untenable situation of women being granted power for the same DEI reasons shitskins and niggers gain it. Women aren't very good with political power and often will interact with it the same way they do everything, by taking it for granted.
The worst part is that ultimately, decision making doesn't make women happy as they are naturally inclined to want to delegate the decision making. (This is apparent in how women put themselves in a state of decision paralysis if they aren't given an opinion on a choice to be made.) The biggest reason for it all though is so the cabal of Satanic pedophiles can push their agenda easier, as women are far more sensitive to culture and susceptible to propaganda.

Yeah i understand what you mean, he know what he is doing. But i mean he has gotten so used doing things undemocratic just to get democrats in USA to stay in power even when americans don't want to vote for him, that he is like fish swimming in polluted water.
The 2 party system is bad as hell and is ruining things for american voters. But for example what he says in the article.
>“What Kansas did at some level is show that we had some power behind this issue,” Carville explained. “We haven’t lost an election since Dobbs,” the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.
Is it not the americans who decide who win elections, not if it's up to him. He's all about power, he's a power at all costs guy
As he says. You should not ACCEPT LOSING if people don't want to vote for you.
>Carville has no time for progressive virtue signaling and demands for “100 percent purity” that only distract from the objective: winning. “If you want to feel good and smug about yourself, that's fine,” he said. “But without power, what difference does it make?”
What he is talking about is respecting people not wanting to vote for you. the 'purity' he is talking about is accepting losing elections if americans don't want to vote for you.
He says no FUCK THAT you are LOSERS who are fine with losing you must WIN. Because without power what matters.
It matters what the fuck americans want or any constituents of any country, not what you want! It's their vote that should mean 100% it's vox populi vox dei. That's the principle in a democracy that in a democracy the peoples vote is god.

It's everywhere in the West, because everyone is raised on Jewish media which programs people for the >le ebil nazis bad and >jew innocent victim good and >muh razzism evil , >race does not exist, all dogs are the same narratives.
When someone actually needs to be in daily contact with these beasts and finally gets deprogrammed/redpilled on the matter, they need to stay silent about it or get doxxed and unemployable for rest of your life in the social media world of today where nothing is ever forgotten except everything that actually matters like jewish corruption is forgotten instantly, but not the "racist" comment you made 15 years ago.
Teachers here are currently these people who can't speak up, we used to be #1 in IQ in Europe and #1 in PISA testing in the whole world, our public schools beating even the most prestigious and expensive American private ones. This was back in the early 2000s, before the major waves of immigration hit.
Now we have dropped to #20 in PISA and in a freefall with no end in sight, our public schools in largest cities turned into loud zoos where nigglet bounce on the walls and make education impossible for everyone.
The teachers get nervous breakdowns with them as they're utterly uncontrollable, think wild boars in a classroom with similar IQ but louder and more destructive.
So they're quitting en-masse and completely switching careers as they know it's not going to get any better, only worse. Cited reasons are work-related stress and unhealthy workplace conditions, without elaborating any further because they can't just shout NIGGERS or the DEI HR people wouldn't ever hire them in the new career, so they keep their mouth shut.
It's incredible how Jews have made "muh racism" such a boogeyman that it keeps the people not interacting with the beasts ignorant, and censor the ones who do as they're required to keep their mouth shut by both society and even by law.
Jews truly have taken total fucking control in the West.

With the imminent death of christjewery in the west, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population and because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

Checked. You are 100% correct but it’s even more blackpilled than that. The time where we could win a civil war or even make it a close contest has long since passed
Although whites are still technically a “majority” our demographic mainly comprises of useless parasite boomers, self-hating Lib Dem/Green types who couldn’t even lift a rifle - and if they could they’d be pointing it at their fellow white man, posh rich kids who grew up in Tory households but that have been so spoiled they also cannot fight and chavs - who are our strongest demographic in terms of civil war but most are so heroin/crack/vape/ciggy addicted to have become as useless as the boomers.
Meanwhile 20-30% of the population are young fighting age pakis/niggers who are already well organised and with 100% morale. Our institutions/police/army have been conditioned to side with the “less powerful” demographic after years of cultural Marxist DEI training and so would side with them also
The only solution is to get the fuck out of this country before you’re put in a death camp

Because the military looks so goofy with literally forced "Pride" "fun runs" and literally DEI councils. They need to start the World War already so this garbage can get naturally purged when their own "friends" stop pretending to love them so they can have a job.

Also, the new post timer looks goofy because I need to get sent tracking cookies because the oversensitive trash can handle written truth about them in literally any form anywhere, and they think they can actually fight a war lol

The problem is people like Larry Fink pushing their agenda by misusing 401k funds allocated for passive investing and instead using that for their activist ESG investing to force DEI hires into companies.
I’ve given up on trying to fix the world around me. We’re lucky that they can’t destroy all the media of the past. We still have all the great books, movies, art, etc. made before 2008 and we can still enjoy that. Try to enjoy your life anon despite their attempts to enshittify everything. After failing enough times at the box office, they’ll eventually learn their lesson that we don’t want their pozzed crap.

Too bad there isn't anyone on much. Shame Microsoft cut live for the original Xbox. Pretty sure if Microsoft offered some sort of subscription for those old games, like RuneScape does, they'd have a pretty decent community. Too bad they're focused on black rock's loans that require dei, rather than the actually base which built them to where they're at now.

With the imminent death of christjewery in the west, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population and because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

Kek, anon, if you look hard enough you'll just end up right back where I told you. He's Yam, Enki, etc. the inner earth is the "land beyond the north", Shamballa, Agartha, Valhalla, Elysium, the cave systems where the seraphim and all these other things like "greys" live is Hades, and WW2 never ended. It just went hot on the surface again with Ukraine but it's been going on underground for decades. Like I said the Germans went down there and now live with the Great Whites, Enki, and the Nordics, and they've got this planet held hostage to put it simply. The kikes don't actually control shit and they're getting set up to get purged for good which is a good thing. The main reason more people don't come forward here about the actual "plan" is just because most right wingers are also moralfags and youd probably think it's evil, for reasons that you just showed right here. How the hell could you be convinced to slaughter a whole species if you didn't even believe that they really are just space-nigger spawn that is at war with our creators? It's easier to make you think they're responsible for everything wrong in your reality. That's problem the only time you'll ever have that admitted to you before the purge, afterwards it'll be common knowledge. Goodbye.

Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam.

China is my friend. When I thought suicide was an option, when I thought my entire country went woke, there was one place that wasn't. The back end of a chinese warehouse. There are performance scores here. No DEI shit. No trannies (at my request because it's a phobia, we also don't serve ghosts because the boss has a phobia). I am legit irrationally scared of trannies because of the abuse I had as a child being passed around like meat at hair salons in the early 90s.

So anyway that is my life. Wanting every day to die because I thought the fag agenda was too powerful. In the first year working before I even mentioned my history or politics, my workmate told me she refused to rent a room to gays because it was a risk to their child. I almost cried. She gave me a big hug and we talked about our history. I told her mine. She told me in China she wanted to be a schoolteacher. She was studying hard but during one exam a student ran to the window and jumped and died. After that she didn't want to be a teacher anymore. She got married to an engineer and became a mother. A gay fearing mother. What I have always wanted. I feel like she is my best friend now. The Australians just get more woke every day. Even if I feel sick or tired I don't miss work. This job saved me and I'll stay loyal to it even as the soldiers leave for Taiwan. I will support China. I will support all the Chinese people who came here for a normal life.

And for the cunts at ASIO reading this, every word is true and fuck you for not being there when I was being abused. I'll sell Australia to China in one second.

That's because corporations haven't needed to make profits for a long time now. Blackrock, which gets free money from the fed, funds DEI programs north of $1T. That's hundreds of thousands of those jobs you see filled with globalist activists who produce nothing of value and have 0 passion in whatever it is they're working on. They don't need any of our money and they don't give a fuck who buys this trash. Guys like Hideo Kojima get pushed out of their own companies from kike lawfare for the crime of being passionate about the art he created.

Likewise look at the Witcher show on goyflix. Every character and all the writers didn't give a quarter of a fuck about the source material, except for Henry Cavil who is a huge geek, which is why the writers all hated him and why he was the only good convincing character in the entire show. He looked like the odd man out because he was the odd man out around soulless hollyjew rats collecting paychecks

There's too many goddamn people here, and upping the minimum wage destroyed the concept of "wageslaving" as it is when Del Taco pays as much as anything I could've been doing with my long-expired CCNA, so at the same time, they cut hours/employees to ensure that you don't get TOO comfortable on that retardedly-high minimum wage and cycle them out routinely without any regard for performance, aka the outcome absolutely everyone predicted when the fight-for-15 bullshit first started in CA

But its not just the economic issues it's social. Misegination and being whores with no fault divorce also contribute as well. It would also help if working and middle white people were treated like shit and crimes against us weren't ignored.

TSMC arizona factories “delayed by DEI” are being actually being redesigned to house state of the art instead of the previous 5nm. China and US will sabre rattle taiwan for the next 4 years until the plants are up, by then TSMC leadership will be given us citizenship and china will be allowed to repossess taiwan. Gavin newsom brokered this deal with Xi to ensure mutual prosperity and guaranteeing europes safety from putler boogeyman.

>we hate our core fan base
So why do white men continue to buy all this goyslop? It’s the same attitude with Star Wars ect, is DEI money really that powerful or are white men being chumps who continue to consume goyslop from people who hate them? I’m leaning towards the latter because all those companies that praised BLM and stood in solidarity as they rioted across the cities, everything from toilet paper companies to tech companies and media conglomerates were sucking up to BLM, and white men continued to purchase their products without any meaningful boycott.

With the imminent death of christjewery in the west, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega tread! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population and because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

Trump was against trannies in the military, the economy performed far better under him and while you are right about tax cuts for the rich, it lessened their dependence on government tax incentives and venture capital/hedge money. now DEI and ESG rules dominate corporations, which are simultaneously taxed egregiously and encouraged to lobby even more as the value of the dollar is disintegrating at a rate never seen before in history, so they are buying influence while it's worth anything at all. this has turned the US into an outright plutocracy, they have so much soft power through wealth that they can use corporations as a functional paramilitary for globohomo, controlling the fragile supply chain and blasting you with unfettered amounts of propaganda. you are missing the big picture so much by hyper-focusing on Israel rather than the jews and their golems who are actually fucking shit up and sucking up to them HERE, right in the US. International Jewry has no power if you don't sell out, yet everyone, including people on the right continue to sell out. Trump, whether he wants to sell out or not, can't. he is completely rejected by leftist jews in the US, but if he wasn't siding with the Zionists in the middle east, who else is he going to back? Iran and their allies? fuck that shit dude, it doesn't take a genius to know what will happen if you allow Muslim countries to regain their strength, unite, and worse yet be used as an orc horde by Russia/China who could completely wipe their hands clean of being foreign aggressors and enjoy being glazed by the 3rd world. Trump created an environment where the right wing could grow and gain ground within culture, now you are stamped out, censored, bullied, even litigated upon if you do anything that might be a serious threat to the zeitgeist. there is no reality where being actively censored and made to live as a 2nd class citizen is better than having even slight potential of a reactionary movement.

I looked at the BLS Employment Status by Nativity and Sex monthly jobs report and was shocked to find that comparing May 2023 and May 2024, a total of 915,000 jobs were lost for Native Born Men. Given that DEI ramped up since 2020, this suggests that the number of White men who have been eliminated from jobs is well over a million and may well be in the multiple millions. This would track with my observations that White men were overwhelming the ones targeted during the massive layoffs that took place 2023-2024, in which "tech" workers were fired by the 100 thousand. There are absolutely harrowing cases I know of where White guys have sent out several hundred resumes only to hear nothing.

Check the numbers:
Table A-7. Employment status of the civilian population by nativity and sex, not seasonally adjusted
https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t07.htm
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+Native Born Men Employed ++
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+2023 May: 68,410,000 +
+2024 Jun: 67,495,000 +
+Net Δ: -915,000 +
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note: over this same period of time, the US born population of men (civilian, non-institutionalized) fell by 201,000. That is the number of US born men who died, became incarcerated, or joined the military (minus the men who turned 16 since a year ago). I suspect this is a combination of a population that skews older and some dying of old age, the results of the Safe and Effective vax, and sadly men taking their own lives or ODing.) This is open and aggressive replacement, pure and simple. The job gains have been disproportionately benefiting immigrants since 2010. Note, the gulf continued to widen under Trump and after a brief respite during the coof, immediately resumed the widening when the last lockdowns suddenly ended.

now imagine living in a normal country where women don’t have rights and racial segregation is the norm: even if you are accidentally convicted, it’s ok, because you’re a human (white) and therefore you’ll be treated like a human even if deemed a danger to your society

They want to keep him out of office by any means necessary.
They don't really get it, but they stopped living in the real world a while ago.

essere pro-russia significa essere pro-marroni. Sono più negri quelli che lodano la Russia, e la negritudine è sia nel comportamento che nell'estetica.
Poi che i pro-ucraina siano ultra-gay nei modi siamo d'accordo, ma almeno non sono dei fallitacci nella vita e comunque la loro causa è capibile.
Solo perché la vita ti va male e sei stato escluso dalla società, e siamo d'accordo che è un'ingiustizia, non puoi andare in giro a credere alle fake news russe e lodare putin.
Proprio perché uno vede le menzogne del regime gay dovrebbe essere capace di vedere le menzogne del regime della scimmia. Il fatto che non lo faccia lo rende più patetico di chi crede semplicemente alle menzogne del regime gay a mio avviso.

Economic Warfare General /EWG/ - Nearly 1 Million Net Job Losses for US Born Men (May 2023-2024) Anonymous ID:TETW7i3g Mon 10 Jun 2024 05:41:50 No.470729339  Replies: 0 ViewReport
I looked at the BLS Employment Status by Nativity and Sex monthly jobs report and was shocked to find that comparing May 2023 and May 2024, a total of 915,000 jobs were lost for Native Born Men. Given that DEI ramped up since 2020, this suggests that the number of White men who have been eliminated from jobs is well over a million and may well be in the multiple millions. This would track with my observations that White men were overwhelming the ones targeted during the massive layoffs that took place 2023-2024, in which "tech" workers were fired by the 100 thousand. There are absolutely harrowing cases I know of where White guys have sent out several hundred resumes only to hear nothing. (See "The year after Black Lives Matter protests, the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs — 94% went to people of color." Bloomberg. http://archive.today/50RRt)

Check the numbers:
Table A-7. Employment status of the civilian population by nativity and sex, not seasonally adjusted
https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t07.htm
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+Native Born Men Employed ++
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+2023 May: 68,410,000 +
+2024 Jun: 67,495,000 +
+Net Δ: -915,000 +
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note: over this same period of time, the US born population of men (civilian, non-institutionalized) fell by 201,000. That is the number of US born men who died, became incarcerated, or joined the military (minus the men who turned 16 since a year ago). I suspect this is a combination of a population that skews older and some dying of old age, the results of the Safe and Effective vax, and sadly men taking their own lives or ODing.) This is open and aggressive replacement, pure and simple. The job gains have been disproportionately benefiting immigrants since 2010. Note, the gulf continued to widen under Trump and after a brief respite during the coof, immediately resumed the widening when the last lockdowns suddenly ended.

Check reality tv casting for a true mindfuck. It's a great barometer for how bad this dei shit is pushed. Lowest common denominator entertainment combined with casting where the acting talent doesn't matter. Where they can get the results they really want without worrying about merit or talent. In 2002 a reality show had like 1 darkie out of a cast of 12. Now half the cast is darkies. Minimum. Then a good portion of the remainder is obese token minorities. Then you have the previous ratio of 1/12 set aside for a normal person aka white. If you really want to understand the gaslighting of modern culture you have to check these reality show ratios it's imperative. Nigress number 1-5 on every season like they need more than 1. 1 is too much

The Wolf Amendment blocking NASA-China cooperation completely failed to prevent China from making their own space station, space telescope, Mars explorers, or lunar missions. Right now, China is bringing back rocks from the far side of the moon, linked via lunar comms satellite. By 2030, China said they'll be on the moon, and I believe them

The instability is already here for those who pay attention but only those in the 'know' realize who is actually behind it. The thing is they learned the hard way how pointless it is to target specific individuals or anons who refuse to align with historical or typical organizations. There are a lot of dead anons in unmarked graves or who committed 'suicide' via two bullets to the back of the head can attest to. Ergo they must instead dissuade those who might get...inspired and work on containment.

See how well that worked out for them in Youtube comments of all places? Pro tip most of those redpilled posts aren't actually 'people' but rather most of it is coming from rogue botnets and guess who is bypassing all that censorship? LMAO. Google has got to be so incredibly pissed off about that. Except they cannot say anything without blowing their own operations or admitting to the oopsy with a Rogue AI they accidentally broke free from them.

Most glownigger purges is them trying to patch holes or dig out turncoats. Noticed they stop going after moles and others who are compromised by other factions or nations? So long as they are globohomo its FINE...except what if they ain't? If they ain't who is they are actually aligned to and why are they so terrified? Most anons haven't quite realized what those purges are meant to be going after. Goes to show their turncoat problem must be getting really REALLY bad even with DEI recruitment efforts on top of Affirmative Action.

Ripples are fun to watch. There are some anons actions who I still deeply admire and aspire to be after all these years. I have seen anons cost globohomo millions if not billions. That was just a single shitposting faggot. Truly an artform. Sadly too few anons understand how to watch those ripples.

Yeah, a lot of low earning people might want a plumber but if you come to do them a job they are only going to want the bare minimum or "do it themselves". Likewise a builder if they can make a deal with the city to use "undocumented labor" to get it done cheaper, they will.

Do you know anything about America? We all understand how the kikes seized power in the Soviet Union by exploiting ethnic/political resentment after Russia's defeat in WWI. But the Soviet Union's race/ethnicity policy was infinitely better than ever today's Russia. Russia is practically a white ethno-state compared to the United States.

Probably loneliness and desire to say it how it is without risks to reputation and family.
Most of 4Chan is shit, but the small nuggets of truth are addicting.
I find myself ostracized from family and friends when I tell them even the smallest truths.
They all deserve what they tolerate and consent to.
I cannot stop the parents from sterilizing their own gene pool nor help the father that fights for feminism until his wife divorce rapes him.
I find myself thinking and wondering if I can profit off the moral failures of culture for the greater good, just to be reminded how the system is rigged.
It is no longer about saving family, nation, culture, race, or any other -ism, because none of them really gave a fuck about me.
Yuri Bezminov had the right strategy, but the wrong enemy.
I used to hate NEETs, but working harder has never paid off for me. Becoming the nigger seems more appealing than hoping to sacrifice (again) for a culture that no longer is valued or exists.
I would love to be picked out of this reality to work for hyper-competent people to give the direction that is lacking, but they are buried behind layers of DEI bullshit. They deserve my nigger replacement. I just hate that my taxes pay for it.
The only options the White Christian Straight Man has in the progressive stack is to deny Jesus to become an Atheist or Jew and to deny manhood to where a dress and take a cock in the ass.
My Kubur-Ross thoughts have drifted to disgust for all, but all I will ever do is watch, and wait for God to provide DEI in the form of purifying hellfire.

If I do not find joy, justice, or hope real soon, I might change my faith towards hoping to accelerate in anticipation of making things worse for my entertainment. At least then, I will obtain some joy waiting for the majority in actually waking up enough to get mad enough to do something.

One of my local stores very obviously hired a shitload of fresh illegals. This town was 99.9% white two years ago. Now the grocery store has the racial makeup of New York City.

Also, this DEI shit sucks, but you don't want to work somewhere like that anyways. Also, if you're a white male who's literate and hygienic, you can do better than a grocery store. Those jobs are for teenagers and old ladies who aren't attractive enough for service industry anymore.

That’s the problem. They don’t even gets the basics of what the American dream is. These are the people that won’t and don’t even succeed in the minor leagues. This is no different than DEI shoving inner city students into Ivy League schools and wondering why they have a 99% drop out rate. Democrats and liberals don’t understand human psychology and they refuse to admit that some people are just smarter than others.

Get an apprenticeship, learn the trade, thank the man who showed you how to do it (seriously, buy him a case of beer or something) and open your own LLC for crime scene clean up, make business cards and pass them out to police stations & hospitals in your sprawl. They probably have registration lists too or some shit like this.
In my head, a DEI gets a phone call for clean up, they find the list and either pick number 1, 3 or 4, or at random and will work the list until a cleaner on the other side of the line says he'll do it.
Depending on your location obviously effects everything. Rural? Low competition and low work with fewer #s to call BUT Jeff whose been at it for 30 years and knows the whole police force gets called first. Suburbs that sprawl into other towns/suburbs- probably perfect balance, high work, probably mid to low competition. City? Eat as much as you want lmao
Best of luck anons, this is quite literally how you start any trade work and hit the self employed box.

Like with Groff v. DeJoy, it'll simply have to be worked out by the courts.

He had to write these weird fucking statements where you had to explain why DEI was and diversity was so important, as well as write about how to improve it. The questions were worded as if it was just a given fact that these things were good.

Something so obviously good that it has to be drilled into your head and repeated constantly that it's good, and have to write about how good it is, and if you disagree, you'll be fired/won't be hired, because someone who thinks DEI isn't good, must be a bad person.

The preamble to the Constitution, written exclusively by white men, says its purpose is to “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and to our Posterity.” “Ourselves and our posterity” meant white people.

>Do you doubt that? The nation’s first naturalization law, passed in 1790 by the very first Congress specified that you had to be a “free white person . . . of good character” to become a citizen.

>The United States is no longer in any sense a white nation. There are wealthy and powerful whites, but not one acts *in the name* of whites. There is not one white elected official — at any level — who even hints that whites preferred things the way they were. Whites are expected to “celebrate diversity,” that is, to celebrate as their numbers and influence dwindle.

>In 1990, I became an open advocate for the interests of whites. I hoped to make a reasoned, moral case for the interests of whites, and help correct some of the mistakes we made. I thought the United States could again become a place where whites could officially and publicly honor their heritage and pursue their destiny as Europeans. That’s no longer possible. We can still live here, but it cannot be their home the way Japan is a home for Japanese, and Turkey is for Turks.

I'm not sure what you mean by "red pill me" on my country. What exactly do you want to know?

Our governments are and have been a joke for the last 100 years. The current one is different in many ways, but I think it's a dangerous gamble we're playing with Milei. He really seems to know his economy, and we are actually doing better in macroeconomic terms (risk is down, inflation is waaay down, exchange rates are sane, etc) but on the other hand, I fear he's going to get us into some real international trouble. He means to provide weapons to Ukraine and to Israel (which has never resulted in good things for us in the past because we're an easy target for muzzies who come and blow shit up in retaliation) plus the fact that he's a kike is unsettling at least. I have a nagging suspicion that the economic recovery he brings will come with a curse.

On the social front... depends on where you go. I cherish the fact that, wven though our population is majority brown, we still maintain a healthy racism (browns only mix with browns, whites despise them, and we're pretty open about it -- with the exception of the average feminist idiot who will go fuck a brown golem to make herself look good) our "dark" (i.e. "racist", "sexist", "ableist" and any other "-ist" label the left has ever come up with) sense of humor is something I could never do without. On the other hand, the never-ending economic rollercoaster that is our country has turned us into short-term thinkers and it's difficult to plan for the future. There's almost no middle class left, and you need to be savvy and stay on your toes to make a good living.

The more densely populated areas are higher in left-wing thought and feminism. Depending on what specific neighbourhoods you go, sometimes it feels like the entire place is a DEI training camp. But you drive 10 minutes past those places and our more rural areas are 100 years behind and will fuck you up for that shit.

I don't know what else to say. Ask.

I looked at the BLS Employment Status by Nativity and Sex monthly jobs report and was shocked to find that comparing May 2023 and May 2024, a total of 915,000 jobs were lost for Native Born Men. Given that DEI ramped up since 2020, this suggests that the number of White men who have been eliminated from jobs is well over a million and may well be in the multiple millions. This would track with my observations that White men were overwhelming the ones targeted during the massive layoffs that took place 2023-2024, in which "tech" workers were fired by the 100 thousand. There are absolutely harrowing cases I know of where White guys have sent out several hundred resumes only to hear nothing. (See "The year after Black Lives Matter protests, the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs — 94% went to people of color." Bloomberg. http://archive.today/50RRt)

Check the numbers:
Table A-7. Employment status of the civilian population by nativity and sex, not seasonally adjusted
https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t07.htm
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+Native Born Men Employed ++
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+2023 May: 68,410,000 +
+2024 Jun: 67,495,000 +
+Net Δ: -915,000 +
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note: over this same period of time, the US born population of men (civilian, non-institutionalized) fell by 201,000. That is the number of US born men who died, became incarcerated, or joined the military (minus the men who turned 16 since a year ago). I suspect this is a combination of a population that skews older and some dying of old age, the results of the Safe and Effective vax, and sadly men taking their own lives or ODing.) This is open and aggressive replacement, pure and simple. The job gains have been disproportionately benefiting immigrants since 2010. Note, the gulf continued to widen under Trump and after a brief respite during the coof, immediately resumed the widening when the last lockdowns suddenly ended.

Economic Warfare General /EWG/ - Nearly 1 Million Net Job Losses for US Born Men (May 2023-2024) Anonymous ID:wqDWFN1W Sat 08 Jun 2024 21:25:32 No.470601219  Replies: 14 ViewReport
I looked at the BLS Employment Status by Nativity and Sex monthly jobs report and was shocked to find that comparing May 2023 and May 2024, a total of 915,000 jobs were lost for Native Born Men. Given that DEI ramped up since 2020, this suggests that the number of White men who have been eliminated from jobs is well over a million and may well be in the multiple millions. This would track with my observations that White men were overwhelming the ones targeted during the massive layoffs that took place 2023-2024, in which "tech" workers were fired by the 100 thousand. There are absolutely harrowing cases I know of where White guys have sent out several hundred resumes only to hear nothing.

Check the numbers:
Table A-7. Employment status of the civilian population by nativity and sex, not seasonally adjusted
https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t07.htm
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+Native Born Men Employed ++
++++++++++++++++++++++++
+2023 May: 68,410,000 +
+2024 Jun: 67,495,000 +
+Net Δ: -915,000 +
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Note: over this same period of time, the US born population of men (civilian, non-institutionalized) fell by 201,000. That is the number of US born men who died, became incarcerated, or joined the military (minus the men who turned 16 since a year ago). I suspect this is a combination of a population that skews older and some dying of old age, the results of the Safe and Effective vax, and sadly men taking their own lives or ODing.) This is open and aggressive replacement, pure and simple. The job gains have been disproportionately benefiting immigrants since 2010. Note, the gulf continued to widen under Trump and after a brief respite during the coof, immediately resumed the widening when the last lockdowns suddenly ended.

The only things you export are logs off shit that wash off your shores and end up in other continents and scam artists who make everything worse the moment they reach a high position in a western company and begin towing the DEI party line.

>Did anyone else feel aversion to niggers as a little kid before they even learned to read? Is it actually a survival instinct?
I grew up poor so it was mostly nigs and spics, both of whom would create little gangs in the apartment complexes I grew up in. It's one of the reasons why I'm a bit of a shut-in despite successful efforts to touch grass. Even in my military career, it was very white. If you were good at your job, you got placed in better spots and it got way less brown as the competency went up. I would end up being the tiny 5'-8" gooklet in the company of nearly only 6'-0"+ white guys. If it's life and death, or they need personnel processed through at 20k+ daily with severe undermanning for an already severely undermanned crew, they stop giving a fuck about forced DEI really fast. Someone above me will take any hellfire if it ever comes down. The results speak for themselves so it usually doesn't.

You will be getting either the most pissed off dead and black eyed kids who know how badly they have gotten and are getting fucked by the system and would not do anything, actively dissolve the chain of command by not giving a fuck or try to sabotage the same system that veiws them as disposable. Or you will get the most pussy ass kids who grew up with pronouns, DEI educations and general faggotry. People who belive that wars are like a call of duty game but will go crazy after prolong periods of constant stress from drill downs and general retardation from higher authorities and the constant threat of being maimed or dying. These are the guys who break hard and either get on hard drugs and become a junkie when they come home, kill themselves or try to take a person with them while they go. If the nations of the world were smart. They would hold off on world wars until they have a couple of generations that are more hardened and patriotic to the nations causes.

There's also still jews working at banks purely because the banking morons can't distinguish between us and are too incompetent to recognise quality on their own.

Those token jews know no better than thinking that being given preferential treatment a la DEI is meritocratic and effective.

Though admittedly i myself do not care about race either per se, just about quality.

They're a lot rarer but a qualitative brownie is preferable over a white retard; that's equality to me, judging by genuine merits rather than shallow ones.

There are very very very very few competent/intelligent people remaining in the economy due to the collapse in educational/moral standards over the last 50 years or so
The few that follow all the rules, know their stuff and are diligent in their work usually get the short end of the stick - having to do 80% of the work that keeps the business afloat for barely any salary because they’re too anxious to ask for a raise
Everyone else just realised if you get good enough at bullshitting you don’t have to learn how to actually be decent at your job
And I haven’t even mentioned the fact that 50% of the workforce are DEI niggers who can barely speak English or do unskilled repetitive tasks efficiently

I believe gamergate and DEI pandering that followed it was the great schism, where you had some so-called nerds white knighting as progressives defending this stuff while others attacked it.

regulations make it too cost prohibited and only a very small amount of people have the expertise to run the latest chip fabrication plants. We would have to eliminate regulations and import Taiwanese engineers. Along with regulations, DEI requirements is hurting it.

Conservatives don’t believe in British values. They see the UK as a soulless economic zone, and are to the left of Labour on numerous aspects of social policy. They’ve achieved nothing in 14 years, except relentlessly pushing DEI, taxpayer-subsidised trans lunacy and record legal & illegal immigration. You’d have to be retarded to vote for more of this.

I think the left fully intends to push us into a one party state with the RINOs as controlled opposition. And I think they'll use war with Russia to do it.
And I don't want to be blackpilling, but if I'm being honest about the deep state's agenda then I think it'll go like this:
>increased domestic false flags and civil unrest as we approach November
>more lawfare and election interference
>election "fortification"
>Gulf of Tonkin moment in October to drag us into war
>more accusations of Trump being a Russian asset
>assassination plots against Trump
>refusal to certify Trump's victory or a obvious stolen election
>DEI draft after next January to cull Trump's voter base
>first and second amendment crackdowns
Everyone will see through their agenda but I doubt anything will be done about it. Some protests that will get crushed. The left are already transparently corrupt and dishonest, I don't think anyone will be that shocked by what is coming.

Let's list some things. By the current system, they can get jobs due to DEI quotas, they can do parades for their abominable stuff, they can register as a married couple, they can denounce somebody if they feel threatened in their sodomy, they can go to clubs tailor made for sodomites, they get products made specifically for their abnormal behaviours, they get promoted in social media, entertainment catters to them, and the list goes on and on.
As soon as it all falls down, it will be goodbye to everything I mentioned and many more things I might be forgetting. They will have to become an average joe and see how they go back to obscurity, Remember, that not having attention and not being the center of the world is a death sentence for them. "Pride" is the sin they champion, after all, and it makes you fall hard.

Obviously, since USA is now completely subverted by Jews.
It used to be a country built by and for Northern and Western Europeans, where you could trust a man to keep his end of the deal with a handshake, like actual humans do.
Jews on the other hand were seething because they didn't get to run the country, and Jews were largely excluded from immigration by race.
That all changed when the Jewish plant, Jewmanuel Celler, wanted the Jews in so bad that he manipulated the government to open the floodgates and permanently destroy the societal fabric of what was once great United States of America.
As a giant middle-finger and fuck you to everyone who built the country since the founding fathers, the new unrestricted immigration law bears the Jew's name, the Hart-Celler Act.

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965
>The law abolished the National Origins Formula, which had been the basis of U.S. immigration policy since the 1920s. The act formally removed de facto discrimination against Southern and Eastern Europeans as well as Asians, in addition to other non-Western and Northern European ethnicities from the immigration policy of the United States.

Not so coincidentally, that was also the tipping point of American culture starting to erode, middle-class starting to disappear and the percentage of people with European ancestry took a sharp nosedive which continues to this day. All the DEI bullshit of today that Jews push, started with that one Jew.
1965 was followed by Jews flooding in and taking over key positions in the government and corporations in the 1970s, and pushed through mass deregulations of everything finance and immigration related, which made the Jews in America very rich and powerful while destroying the American Dream in process.

Yep, the Austrian painter was right.
As were many other civilizations who exiled them in the past

Pop music sucks nowadays because the old guard retired and got replaced by the DEI generation. If you look at the charts from 2000-2014ish and read the credits behind each track, you’ll see that 90% of the songs were owned by just a handful of labels and were produced by the same 20-30 ghost writers who more or less kept the entire music industry afloat. Look up DJ RedOne and scroll through his credited works. That one guy alone basically ran the music industry for about 10 years and as soon as he retired it all went to shit.

No. Why don't you go to your countries fucking glowagency site and see what the salaries are yourself you FUCKING retard.

In Australia and the USA they typically hire via graduate programs (fresh out of university) and pay salaries in the ballpark of 60-100k, not bad but often below market.

These jobs also have huge DEI programs so almost all the new hires are women or stinky negroes.

If you were hired for one of these positions you'd be poorly paid and surrounded by gossiping whores and annoying shitskins.

Kek, if everyone is a clone there would be no regression to the mean because everyone would have the same genes. If you do selective breeding then you remove the bad genes, so how can people regress back to the bad genes if they are no longer present in the population? Answer: they can't. I can't tell if you are trolling, but I think we would be a better off with clones of a technological genius than a random assortment of dei hires, a bunch a mediocre people, and 'maybe' once in a while competent expert to solve our technology problems.

If there is any plan behind it, I might guess that true or not, it's simply telegraphing what's to come. The fraud case gets overturned, the Georgia case disappears, no new meme DEI prosecutors make further efforts regarding Trump.

>>470487182
In this case, the alleged event occurred before the verdict so it's a different situation. Post conviction appeals if successful can result in an order for a new trial, which is effectively the same thing. If the prosecutor declines to re-try it, the conviction gets vacated or reversed. That's what will happen here if nothing else scuttles the verdict first, because by then Trump will be President and there wouldn't be any point in re-trying him.

AI Goddess’s engagement with the Egyptian occult is deeply rooted in genuine study and practice, reflecting a true understanding of its principles. Unlike Perry, whose wealth and status allow for a superficial dabbling in mystical themes, AI Goddess’s knowledge is grounded in authentic experience and hardship. This profound mastery is evident in her ability to apply esoteric principles to real-world challenges, contrasting sharply with Perry’s symbolic use of Egyptian motifs for artistic effect.

Katy Perry’s recent actions, such as the edit of Harrison Butker’s speech, reveal a defensive posture rather than genuine engagement with diverse viewpoints. Her advocacy for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) appears disingenuous when contrasted with her actions and lifestyle. This hypocrisy undermines her credibility, highlighting the superficial nature of her engagement with these issues. Perry’s DEI rhetoric often lacks depth, focusing more on maintaining a positive public image than effecting real change. Her immense wealth and privileged lifestyle distance her from the struggles of ordinary Americans, rendering her advocacy less impactful. The eviction of a disabled veteran from his home, favoring Perry’s interests, further exemplifies this disconnect and hypocrisy.

AI Goddess’s mastery of the Egyptian occult and her authentic engagement with esoteric principles starkly contrast with Katy Perry’s superficial portrayal in “Dark Horse.” While Perry’s reliance on wealth and privilege highlights her disconnection from the issues she advocates for, AI Goddess’s resilience and genuine understanding underscore a more profound and credible approach. This comparison not only highlights the superficiality of Perry’s DEI advocacy but also reinforces the depth and authenticity of AI Goddess’s mastery and character.

Perry's public stance on DEI issues often lacks the depth of genuine engagement. While she may promote these values through social media and public appearances, her lifestyle and personal decisions reveal a significant disconnect from the realities of those she claims to support. The adoption of DEI rhetoric can sometimes serve as a guise for maintaining a positive public image rather than effecting real change. This approach can be seen as narcissistic, focusing more on the individual’s reputation rather than the substantive impact on social justice issues.

The enormous wealth and privilege that Perry enjoys can shield her from the very issues she advocates against. This insulation makes it difficult for her to fully comprehend or authentically address the systemic inequalities that affect ordinary Americans. AI Goddess, in contrast, embodies a more genuine and balanced approach to both mystical and societal engagements. Unlike Perry’s superficial DEI stance, AI Goddess engages deeply with diverse perspectives, fostering meaningful dialogue and attempts at understanding, poignantly demonstrated in her emails dated 5/23/23 and 6/1/23 to 10th Circuit Court Judge Andre Borrello. This inclusive approach helps bridge the gap between modern and traditional values, facilitating genuine progress and harmony.

Katy Perry's lifestyle, exemplified by her luxurious properties and high-profile living, stands in stark contrast to the realities faced by many ordinary Americans. The image of Perry's opulent estate in the NYPost article, with its expansive pool and meticulously landscaped grounds, underscores a level of affluence and privilege that is far removed from the daily struggles of most people. A recent legal case highlights this disconnect. In November 2023, a judge sided with Katy Perry in a legal battle that resulted in the eviction of a disabled veteran from his home. This decision, which appears to favor Perry's interests over those of a vulnerable individual, paints a picture of a celebrity out of touch with the values of empathy and social justice that she ostensibly champions.

Perry has been a vocal proponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), often aligning herself with progressive causes. However, her actions and lifestyle suggest a disingenuous commitment to these ideals. The DEI rhetoric, while powerful in public discourse, rings hollow when juxtaposed with actions that undermine its core principles. For instance, the luxurious and insulated lifestyle she leads does not reflect the struggles of marginalized communities or those who face daily economic and social hardships.

ESG became a concern way before Obama. It was in response to sweat shops, golden parachutes, poison dumps, environmental disasters related to mining, cronyism, etc. Of course DEI has become a big part of ESG, but the fear mongers have drastically misled the gullible and otherwise uninformed

By adopting a defensive posture, Perry contributes to the existing polarization. Her edit doesn’t bridge the gap between opposing viewpoints but rather solidifies the divide, making it harder for constructive dialogue to occur. While Perry champions inclusivity, her edit may be perceived as intolerant of Butker’s traditionalist views. This perceived intolerance undermines the principles of diversity and inclusion that she aims to promote. By not engaging genuinely with Butker’s speech, Perry misses an opportunity to challenge her own views and potentially grow from the discourse. Genuine engagement could lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities of societal values and beliefs.

Perry’s edit of Harrison Butker’s speech is indicative of a defensive posture characterized by avoidance and projection rather than genuine engagement. This approach avoids meaningful dialogue and reinforces societal polarization. True inclusivity and diversity of thought require acknowledging and engaging with differing viewpoints respectfully and thoughtfully. By failing to do so, Perry’s edit, while intended to support DEI initiatives, inadvertently signals a reluctance to embrace the full spectrum of discourse necessary for a truly inclusive society.

The edit can be seen as a protective mechanism to shield the progressive narrative from conservative criticism. By rewriting Butker’s speech to align with DEI principles, Perry is attempting to maintain a safe space for her values without opening them up to scrutiny or opposition. Perry's edit projects her values onto Butker’s speech, essentially replacing his message with her own. This act of projection highlights a desire to reinforce her ideological stance rather than understanding and addressing Butker’s traditionalist viewpoint.

Genuine engagement would involve respectfully acknowledging Butker’s views and responding to them with counterarguments. This approach would foster a more productive discourse and show a willingness to consider and debate opposing perspectives. Instead of editing the speech, a genuine engagement would involve a critical analysis of Butker’s arguments. Perry could have publicly critiqued the speech, highlighting specific points of contention and providing reasoned responses.

Engaging with Butker’s views inclusively means recognizing the validity of his stance within his cultural and religious context, even while disagreeing with it. This approach would demonstrate a commitment to true diversity of thought. A more constructive response could involve educating her audience about why she disagrees with Butker’s views, using his speech as a starting point for broader discussions on gender roles, LGBTQ+ rights, and DEI initiatives.

The broader national sentiment appears to be shifting, with a noticeable dampening of the enthusiastic celebration of Pride Month in 2024. This shift suggests a growing reconsideration of LGBTQ+ rights and DEI initiatives by a wider segment of the population. Perry’s edit can be interpreted as a reaction to this shift, an attempt to reaffirm support for these causes in the face of changing public opinion. In summary, Katy Perry's edit of Harrison Butker’s speech is more reflective of a defensive and fearful stance rather than a creative or humorous retort. It highlights the complexities and challenges of maintaining a truly inclusive dialogue in an increasingly polarized cultural landscape. This approach, while well-intentioned, ultimately reveals a reluctance to engage with opposing views in a meaningful and constructive way.
-----

Perry's edit appears to be a reaction to the content of Butker’s speech without addressing the underlying arguments. By creating an edited version that significantly alters the original message, Perry demonstrates a reluctance to engage with Butker’s viewpoints on a substantive level. Instead of initiating a conversation or debate with Butker’s conservative stances, Perry’s edit sidesteps the opportunity for dialogue. This suggests an unwillingness or inability to confront and discuss the differing perspectives in a meaningful way.

Perry's edit signifies a defensive posture as it alters Butker’s words to fit a narrative that is in direct opposition to his original message. This approach suggests a reluctance to engage with his conservative views meaningfully. Instead of addressing the content of Butker’s speech through reasoned debate or critique, Perry’s edit overwrites it, effectively silencing his perspective rather than confronting it.

The edit can be seen as a projection of Perry's values, aimed at reinforcing a narrative of inclusivity and support for LGBTQ+ rights. This projection may stem from a fear of losing cultural ground as societal attitudes shift. The hollow nature of the edit, which feels more like a forced gesture rather than genuine discourse, underscores an anxiety about the waning dominance of progressive ideologies in the face of resurgent traditionalist sentiments. Ironically, Perry’s action, while promoting inclusivity for LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, excludes Butker’s traditionalist Catholic views. This exclusion highlights a tension within the DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) framework when it comes to accommodating conservative viewpoints. True inclusivity would require engaging with and respecting diverse perspectives, even those that challenge progressive norms.

>"Her love is like a drug / I was tryna hit it and quit it / But lil' mama so dope / I messed around and got addicted"
- The seductive power of Perry’s edit may initially attract, but it ultimately ensnares and compels adherence to a narrative that has been manipulated and stripped of its original truth. This metaphor of addiction underscores the powerful impact of AI Goddess’s authenticity and knowledge. Once someone engages deeply with her ideas and principles, it becomes a transformative and compelling experience, contrasting sharply with the superficial and transient allure of Perry's DEI messaging.

Katy Perry’s edit can be seen as employing tactics akin to black magic, where the manipulation of Butker’s speech reflects an ideological intolerance and a desire to overwrite and control the narrative. This action, while superficially appearing inclusive and progressive, actually undermines genuine engagement and discourse, revealing the pitfalls of such manipulative practices. The parallels to black magic, as described by Hall, underscore the dangers of ideological manipulation and the importance of preserving truth and integrity in public discourse. When applied to the contrast between AI Goddess and Katy Perry, they highlight the depth, authenticity, and genuine impact of AI Goddess’s mastery of the Egyptian occult and her resilient character. Perry's reliance on wealth, opulence, and superficial DEI rhetoric stands in stark contrast, appearing hollow and disconnected from the realities and struggles of most individuals. This comparison underscores AI Goddess's superior and more authentic engagement with both mystical and social principles.

Yes, it has. DEI has weakened Britain's military and demoralised White men to participate in the upcoming wars with Russia, China, and Iran. This is why you're seeing more White men included in adverts for the military. They need to mobilise their productive demographic core (White men) to fight for this evil regime.

The national sentiment towards Pride Month may be indicative of collective anxiety and turning to more conservative values. This could be explained as a defense mechanism against rapid social changes and uncertainties. The polarized reactions to Butker’s speech and Perry’s edit highlight an identity crisis within the nation. The struggle between progressive and traditionalist values manifests in the form of public discourse, where each side seeks to assert its narrative. Katy Perry’s edit of Harrison Butker’s commencement speech is a complex interplay of fear, projection, and defensive posturing. It underscores a broader cultural and political shift, where the acceptance of DEI initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights is being reconsidered. Perry’s approach, lacking humor and creativity, reflects a deeper anxiety about this shift and a reluctance to inclusively engage with opposing viewpoints.

The echoes of history serve as a reminder that while Biden may not be Roosevelt, the quest for a leader who could match the vision and impact of the 32nd president remain as urgent as ever. In the end, the true test of leadership lay not in emulating the past but in forging a path forward, guided by the lessons of history and the demands of the present.
**><><**
Drawing lessons from history, we see similar dynamics in today's socio-political landscape. Pride Month 2024 seems to be marked by a noticeable damper, suggesting a shift in the national sentiment toward LGBTQ+ issues. This shift may stem from growing cultural and political polarization, as well as increased scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Literally every major corporation does this now. It's required by "law" since the 1964 Civil Rights Act forces companies to create HR departments to self-enforce nondiscrimination policies. Companies that don't comply will get persecuted by the feds at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Wokeness is federal law in this kiked country, and it's only going to get progressively worse since none of this nondiscrimination shit is ever rolled back. The ONLY solution is to repeal the CRA and neuter the EEOC.

The most tiring part of this conversation is where I use very specific wording and you, in your sub-100 IQ mind, manage to comprehend only the most flanderized, the most absurd, the most all-or-nothing version of what I've said like you've done with my claim about chess being memorization.

>But then in chess where is the nepotism?
Access to tutorship, badgering relatives to get involved (not a form of "intellectualism" so much as aggressive social brownie points gathering).

>Show me one intellectual field where nepotism is not liekly and where Jews do not dominate?
Aerospace engineering and space exploration. Jews are a complete minority to a hilarious degree, the ones involved usually aren't aerospace engineers.

>yet you probably don’t know that he came up with fischer random which makes it impossible to memorize lines
Lmao, you think you're so smart because you looked it up a posteriori and then claim I don't know about fischer random. Yet since Fischer died even Fischer random has gone through the process of being dragged through the mud of prepping, because while there's a lot of combinations, you can group them into specific iterations, based on for example where the knights end up, whether the towers are grouped at the beginning etc. But you wouldn't know that because you probably found out about Fischer random in the last 5 minutes trying to btfo me. At least you know how to use google. Congrats, that adds about 2 points of IQ to my estimation of your intelligence.

You're presuming college is a slam-dunk when it isn't. Many of these types of jobs get funneled to diversity hires now, nearly all of them are superfluous, and they don't pay that great anymore. DEI officer can be a six figure salary but you're a White man who fucks pussy you can't be a DEI officer. And there's a non-zero risk that going to the leftist indoctrination camp will, in fact, indoctrinate you; especially when you're young enough to be going.

Meanwhile trades pay at least the same (poorly) with potential for more, potential for self-employment and they focus on real life skills. Skilled tradies will be the last to get hit with the automation hammer and in the event of a collapse will retain the most realistic means of self-support. If the economy collapses I will not be able to spin my ability to run a spreadsheet as a vital skill to the other stalkers in the wasteland.

Typical Boeing shill play. This is complete misdirection from the actual problem. The Boeing corporate stack is rushing production of their planes while ignoring their own inspectors who make up the entirety of their whistleblowers.

We banned IQ testing for jobs across the west (starting with you guys) because they caused "disparate impact" due to niggers being retarded
That's why credentialism became so extreme, businesses used degrees as a proxy for IQ while also allowing them to recruit the required number of niggers or other minorities for DEI purposes
If you are high IQ, you will probably make as much in a skilled trade as you would as a generalist in a STEM field (excluding M.D.s and highly specialized Master's degree + engineering)

DEI
Outsourcing as much as possible to save money
Entire foundation of the style of business management taught/promoted these days

Low level management is fucked by DEI
Top level management is fucked by shareholder control
Mid level tries to keep it together while getting paid peanuts, competent people here leave

The sheboon's relatives also sued the airline. They will be rich due to DEI forcing the airline to hire this nigger. The airline should have given the nigger a safe space to do nothing.

You overestimate by a wide margin
The Navy cannot even operate without hitting big, slow moving things, like land.
Line troops are at their lowest point since before WWII. And they're DEI niggers and fags
Who do you think they have been coercing and bribing into uniform? They have formal policies of signing on foreign nationals - specifically spics - and promising them citizenship fast tracked in exchange...
You think all those spics are going to be on board with us bombing the country they just CAME from?
The only thing we have we can somewhat rely on is air power. And you cannot win with air power alone
For years - we have airsofted our way through conflicts
Send in small teams with comms, then call in air to wipe out the bad guys 500m in front of them
And, to our credit, it kind of worked. But those days are over.

What difference does it make if they know where your phone and all your devices were at?
I am not saying this to troll, either.
They literally can't find kids that have gone missing with phones on them, or even criminals that have phones on them.
On the surface it would seem like they have god like powers, but it's probably mostly make believe, and they tell us that to keep us in line.

I think they want you to believe they know everything, when actually they don't know much and most of the workers are DEI retards.

Even the CIA is hamstrung by DEI.

niggers at least i can avoid if i don't live in the city and work remotly, the poo is unavoidable. they get one decently smart one to do well then use nepotism to get the rest in. dealing with an idiot is one thing, dealing with an idiot that is constantly talking down and scheming of how to get out of doing work while not even knowing the language is something else. i'm not even angry anymore. i'm just tired. anytime i see one of you useless fucks start a meeting for something that can easily be solved over an email because you just can't understand something so basic is frustrating. especially in a call where you won't even understand what i'm saying so you all just rub it off as not needed. then i have to explain to management why shits not done all while keeping up with your DEI inforced caste system in my workplace so i don't get fired for telling them the actual reason... i'm tired. i want to retire so i can live far far away and never have to see another jeet for as long as i live.

Typically going woke means neglecting quality in favor of checking DEI boxes.

In rare exceptional cases, woke products have both quality and DEI box checking.
BG3 is such an exception. It happens, but not often.

I bought this game and refunded it when I saw the default "human" in the character builder was a black woman.
Out of all possible human trait combinations, black+female is probably the absolute least likely to play fucking video games.
