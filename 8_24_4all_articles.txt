They lower the bar for niggers to get into medical school, but it's still the same standards for them to graduate. That's why they have such a high rate of failure. Insane liberals have wrote think pieces crying about how many nigs fail out of med school, but what do they expect? As far as I know, they haven't just started letting them skate through on DEI principles. If you meet a black doctor, they passed the same curriculum the asian and white doctors did to graduate.

>white man
>not villainmaxxing
NGMI

It has been our observation for many years now that white men have zero political representation. Neither party in the US supports white men, and both are pandering to just about every group except white men. Even in the UK, that Rwandan jogger stabbed a bunch of white children, and the political class there tried to appease Muslims. Our ancestors built the west, but every group except us is given preferential treatment. This attitude does not just exist in politics, with DEI policies at most companies, virtually no one is hiring white men, ESPECIALLY new grads trying to get started in their field. They keep down white men because historically we are effective at standing up to them.

White men, it’s bad but don’t give up, here are some actionable steps. We need to start villainmaxxing. They already treat us like villains just for existing, time to actually embrace being villains. No longer do we begrudgingly uphold a rigged social contract that has been hijacked by Jews with the intent of keeping white men down, fuck that. Every other group uses exploitation and trickery to get ahead, so we do the same. Time to outjew the jews at their own game. Upon seeing the laws and talking to others with this mindset, below is a list of possible ways to LEGALLY exploit the current order for our own gain. These tricks not only work to varying degrees for many people, but make jews and normies seethe for added bonus.

>Lie about your race on a college/job application meant for DEI hires
>Use LEGAL tax loopholes to pay the least amount of taxes or take advantage of the system
>Refuse to serve ZOG
>Debt free living to avoid enslavement to Jew bankers
>Off grid living to be independent of ZOG infrastructure
>Organizing assets like Hakimi so a divorce rape can’t take shit from you
>On a larger scale, white communities splitting off into their own jurisdictions

If you’ve got more lets hear it

What you wrote is completely made up. The dykes have zero impact on the story and offer no other sidequests if you save them vs killing them. The main villain in power (Gortash) is male, The Emperor is male, the main hero is male (The Prophet), the devil is male, The Duke is male, the cult leader is male, both starting camp leaders are male, the best mage is male. Most of the women in power are evil cunts and you kill all except the Githyanki queen.

The only niggers I can remember are The Duke, his son and the leader of the city guard (who while a girl boss is for once a hot black milf rather than a hideous ape like in every other DEI game).

You're out of you mind, the last thing they want is to be known as the lapdogs of Israel even though it is obvious to everyone by now. Likewise it has become well known that the Democrat Party is made up of Anti-White Socialists, that is why they come up with ideas such as: "White Privilege" "Anti-Colonialism" "Reparations" based on race, "DEI," etc. It is obvious the Democrat Party is anti-White, and they do so by projecting the evil characteristics of Jews onto Whites.

The reason white people aren't having children:

Its not because of some unknown factor.
Its because the powers that be, are actively pushing for fewer whites (worldwide).

Look at some of the facts:
*DEI corrupting businesses and hiring practices
*Interracial or "diversity" adverts everywhere you look
*BBC porn spamming
*Institutional racism posing as anti-racism
*Illegal aliens encouraged to enter the country, in spite of the cost and many issues it causes
*Riots when a black person is shot or killed by police (even when its justified)
*Whites demonized as being "far-right/extremist" for not wanting to have their lives, country, and culture destroyed by foreigners
*Divorce laws favor women and punish men. Men will pay child support and have their livelihood stolen
*Birth control (but when you live off welfare/govt assistance why not have as many as you want?
*Violent niggers. Everyone is aware of the problem, but those who actively work against the white race play games and pretend that the niggers arent the problem, but in fact they are THE VICTIMS
*Politicians, WEF, and other rich NGOs put their wealth and influence to work to make this happen. Why else do you think the US, Canada, Europe, etc (predominantly white countries) are all systematically being overrun?

I feel absolutely mogged lads.

I'm in a more affluent part of the country that has defo been heavily changed by Muslim migrants. Most of my friends are mega lefties. Theyre all on high alert coz of the planned riots. Immediately calling every protestor Far Right, no thought of the girls murdered in Southport, no thought for the rape gangs, no thoughts on the spiralling machete crime, and they havent listened to a single Tommy Robinson talk.
I don't know if the constant use of 'Far Right' is a psyop specifically by GCHQ, but it feels like the division is complete. The middle class have officially replaced any idea of 'working class' with 'immigrants'. CRT and DEI has made its move complete. My friends have complete disdain for the native working class.
The only hope I can think for the rioters is that they need to make their messaging extremely precise (as in make their message specifically about grooming gangs and islamic terrorism in five words or less), and they need to just not give up. Even if its constant peaceful marches from now on. Just permanence more than destruction. Otherwise, the government will just quash it, increase the influx of muslims, and allow the country to fall.
The leftoids think that they are leading the country to harmony, but actually, it will just lead to a parallel society where the islamic communities live directly on top of the non-muslim communities, and legislation won't change to be more conservative, but will change to protect muslims and mass migration more.

Has their been a people's who have left their native land and thrived for the better elsewhere? I genuinely have thoughts about my future family starting a new chapter in America/Australia/Scandinavia etc. I genuinely think that over the next few decades, this country will be lost.

30 + 1 + 300 + 5 + 10 + 50 + 70 + 200 = 666.

"Vicarivs Filii Dei" is a Latin phrase that translates to "Vicar of the Son of God." This title has been attributed to the Pope, suggesting his role as the representative or deputy of Jesus Christ on Earth.

Vicarivs:
V = 5
I = 1
C = 100
A = (no value)
R = (no value)
I = 1
V = 5
S = (no value)

5 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 5 = 112

Filii:
F = (no value)
I = 1
L = 50
I = 1
I = 1

1 + 50 + 1 + 1 = 53

Dei:
D = 500
E = (no value)
I = 1

500 + 1 = 501

Sum of the Roman numerals:
112 (Vicarivs) + 53 (Filii) + 501 (Dei) = 666

Quoted By: >>477362642
It has been our observation for many years now that white men have zero political representation. Neither party in the US supports white men, and both are pandering to just about every group except white men. Even in the UK, that Rwandan jogger stabbed a bunch of white children, and the political class there tried to appease Muslims. Our ancestors built the west, but every group except us is given preferential treatment. This attitude does not just exist in politics, with DEI policies at most companies, virtually no one is hiring white men, ESPECIALLY new grads trying to get started in their field. They keep down white men because historically we are effective at standing up to them.

White men, it’s bad but don’t give up, here are some actionable steps. We need to start villainmaxxing. They already treat us like villains just for existing, time to actually embrace being villains. No longer do we begrudgingly uphold a rigged social contract that has been hijacked by Jews with the intent of keeping white men down, fuck that. Every other group uses exploitation and trickery to get ahead, so we do the same. Time to outjew the jews at their own game. Upon seeing the laws and talking to others with this mindset, below is a list of possible ways to LEGALLY exploit the current order for our own gain. These tricks not only work to varying degrees for many people, but make jews and normies seethe for added bonus.

>Lie about your race on a college/job application meant for DEI hires
>Use LEGAL tax loopholes to pay the least amount of taxes or take advantage of the system
>Refuse to serve ZOG
>Not relevant anymore but refusing the Covid jab and not masking
>Debt free living to avoid enslavement to Jew bankers
>Off grid living to be independent of ZOG infrastructure
>Organizing assets like Hakimi so a divorce rape can’t take shit from you
>On a larger scale, white communities splitting off into their own jurisdictions

Don't even need to go that far back. Remember Trump and Pompeo's attempts to meme Sino-Russian antagonism into existence by bringing up (fake) PRC territorial "claims" against Russia in their diplomatic engagements with the Kremlin? All while giving Ukr aid (like Javelins!). Vote for le based new right to fight for Israel while your country gets spammed with infinity jeets. Btw nobody did anything about DEI so women and "ineligibles" have a two-year advantage on top of preferential hiring. Can anyone blame Richard Spencer for the path he's taken lol

British glowniggers cover everything up. They're the ultimate example of the anarcho-tyranny, neoliberal authoritarian paradoxical state - the state that enforces the values of globalism, diversity, tolerance, DEI (DIE), anti-white propaganda, and superficial "social equality" while wealth inequality grows. The problems of the West are magnified with the UK's nanny state hierarchal subservient attitude towards government. The British adventurer gene is more likely to be prominent in the Anglo settled in a New World colony. Australia for example has a large portion descended from convicts so there's that rebellious spirit there. The ones that were afraid of risk stayed on the island. And of course you cannot forget those who had died in wars such as WWII, Rhodesia, etc

It's not hard on OPs numbers tho. If he lives with parents 2-3 yrs while working a full time job and saving every penny he makes, he can do it.

The problem is most of the kids today have been conned into believing that they need to spend those years going into college debt to get a wage slave job and then rent the rest of their lives. Either renting from a landlord or renting from a bank. They never own anything. But the kid who didn't go to college, worked a full time job, saved everything, bought property. He's going to be better off than the college kids before they can even leave college.

And it only gets worse for the college kids after they leave college. They'll send out 3000 resumes to companies on linked in who are only interested in DEI requirements while the high school kid taught himself useful trades in his fixer upper and is his own boss.

As much as I know first hand how terrible US hospital systems are with "women/DEI doctors", this nigga was said to be brain dead. What I'm assuming, and I don't know in this case, so don't take this as gospel, but more than likely the medical staff assumed the family was hostile or too emotionally unstable potentially putting the staff's safety at risk. Those alarms are oxygen desat, and iirc, below threshold art. The nurses station gets alerted too. Also doing an EMTALA transfer on a brain dead patient is near impossible, even with a D/AMA. Almost no hospital will take someone like that when the facility has adequate staff and resources. As for organ illicit organ harvesting done at hospitals? Yeah, that's actually a thing, it happens. Is that the case here? I have no idea. But honestly, imo, there's no reason to keep someone who's brain dead alive. They're gone.

And that same DEI policy used to pick her as VP in the first place is now the same reason they had to choose her as the canditate so they're stuck with her.

A. Your coworkers are gossiping faggots who refuse to let you work

If Shahed's can intercept MQ9's, they can take down helicopters, AC-130/C-130's that are flying low enough and most jet aircraft that are taking off or landing at forward air bases. GIANT SWARMS OF DRONES DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE CHANCES OF THIS HAPPENING ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

Those drones can be used to make most close air support, attack/recon drones and aerial resupply IMPOSSIBLE which straight up DESTROYS MODERN US MILITARY DOCTRINE which is based around having tons of information to make decisions while being entirely overly dependent on air cover. The US could never survive modern war without either of those things because the Infantry and Mechanized Forces are all disgusting out of shape Call Of Duty players who also don't know how to counter drones, nevermind massive swarms of cheap Shaheds.

The essential managerial perspective of the people making these decisions also biases them towards the thinking that "you only need a handful of competent white or Asian guys to derive from a team of DEI / cheap H1B browns 90% of what you'd get out of a team composed solely of the former", which is in some sense true because 20% of the people are doing 80% of the work in any organization and vice versa so why not have those have those 80% doing 20% be Walmart-brand

Dawg you need to check the vibe, a lot of independents are on the Trump train now. 4 years of Biden-Harris has been a hell of a redpilling.

Correct, and there honestly hasn't been in living memory.

Any "far-right" party that you may have heard of (BNP, EDL, etc.) were little more than memes. They got like 1 politician, who was always a drunk/drug addict and didn't have an IQ high enough to boil water, and would get banned for posting obviously illegal things in official communications. Basically if they weren't honeypots, they were for people retarded enough to be fooled by honeypots.

Our "right-wing" Conservative/Tory Party has been in power for ~20 years (until just a month ago), and under them:
* gay marriage
* trooning kids
* DEI legal requirements
* more immigration than ever in history
* terrorism an expected event every year
* English proficiency has gone down in children
* most common name in England is "muhammad"
* Ethnic English is a minority in London

This was all done by the "right wing" party. We have no right here in Britain. That's why I said step 1 for us is forming a "respectable" political party. People who never (identifiably) partake in any illegal activity, and never outright condone it, but nonetheless advance the right ideology. People who get shit done with 0 skeletons in their closets.

Identity politics have gone mainstream. Everyone just wants their in-group to be supported politically, but that doesn't really work in a system that's inherently designed to implement laws and standards equally across the board. That's like the entire basis of what this country was founded on. But now we have shit like affirmative action, ESG, DEI, CRT, progressive taxation, etc, and it keeps getting worse because we keep adding more and more inherently unequal people to the picture. At first it was just white land-owning men. Then niggers, Catholics, ethnic jews, women, and everyone else. People are just too different.

Because the commies are emptying the warchest and using every media outlet to manufacture the perception of momentum.

As soon as Kamala opens her mouth, it's over. The woman is nails on a chalkboard. Right now she is riding the "not an animated corpse" bump but will inevitably sure as sunrise run into the "oh wait she's actually a retarded shrill cunt DEI hire" slump.

If it were any candidate besides her I might be worried, but people have forgetting how absolutely hateable she is. It's undeniable. This bitch carried like 2% of the primary voters in 2020. Even the dyed in the wool shitlibs will be nauseated by how awful she is after a couple weeks of hearing her speak.

And to those shilling for her, Trump will win. You grotesque subhumans will once again be treated like the abominations you are.

This. The republican ticket is mildly popular on here because of the meme factor or maybe because idiots on here think Trump is a real WN. He isn’t btw. Democrats are now headed by a younger candidate that is more in touch with the youthful electorate and has an older cream cheese VP ticket to soften the bluntforce trauma for boomers who are on the fence. Sound familiar? See picrel. This won’t be a landslide for the dems but they have the swing voters and independents in the bag at this point for various reasons ranging from the hesitation to elect trump again, his was a failed presidency and he has his supporters, but most voters and republicans are luke warm to him coming back. Jan 6th was over the top to most people. Biden’s economy wasn’t great but not terrible and the fed created policies during the Trump administration that lead to inflation from 2022-to now. Independent conspiratards will vote for RFK Jr dividing the vote with Trump. Moreover, this is now definitely about who you hate more. You are voting for the ticket you hate the least. It can be seen on pol even though Harris is obviously being shilled by dembots and fedbots. Trump and Vance are being routed and will need something dynamic to happen in order for them to get the upper hand in this race. FBI needs to open an investigation into Harris or the new VP, or Trump needs to save a baby from a burning building and make a coherent speech that can placate basedcomservativeRINO types. Vance is also a sign of how weak and bad the Trump ticket is, DeSantis could have organized the party and would have a solid lead against anyone else. He obviously didn’t accept the VP position and Trump probably didn’t want to offer him that since they obviously hate each other both as rivals and on a personal level. Nikki Haley would have been a better VP candidate. Vance is untested and too controversial and won’t bring in the DEI crowd because he is obviously a snake and everyone can that.

Hardcores are going to vote for their party no matter what, but all the moderates and even the women who lean right but don't really care for Trump are going to vote for this DEI president.

Oh and when shtf, most of the colonizers who are just “coming for a better life” will leave. I doubt the DEI hires in LE and military have the same resolve as native freedom fighters. Right now they get a high reward for low risk and that why they do it, not as much out of a sense of duty or nationalism. As soon as their benefits come with a real cost, the ones that dont outright quit will be reluctant to follow orders.

I graduated high school in 2009 and have never had a consistent job that paid enough to move out. Such luxuries went from boomers only during the 2008-2014ish recession to impossible requirements so lying H1Bs and illegals could drive down wages to the presently melting hellscape of international DEI corporatocracy.

I'm white and tick no boxes but I got a job because the technical interview makes it very easy to show you're good. I'm not saying the DEI stuff isn't real, it definitely is. My company was bragging about finding ALL interns from some conference for only black people. there was literally no shot for anyone who wasn't black. But that advantage ends once you get a foot in the door. The companies still want to make money. If you make it clear you're competent you'll get a job. If you find stuff to work on that makes you invaluable you won't get laid off. All the people getting dumped are the people who were making day in the life videos. They were the dead weight that the smart coders were hand holding through every task they were given. It's most definitely a skill issue.

For then anons on here saying that the caste system doesn't exist anymore it absolutely does, you've just never seen it and you probably never would, it keeps just out of sight. These are people that come over here with their classic rolls royce clubs and tour the west of Ireland, stopping at old manor houses and castles that have are now converted into guest houses and 5 start hotel, these are places where I have worked. These places are also always ran by a specific managerial class, that feels almost hereditary as well, and I always found that type to be good employers. I would far prefer to be fully back in that rigid social structure than be a working white man in this current DEI hell.

And the corps don't give a fuck because they don't track anything related to labor, and some bean counter claims victory over reducing the budget because recruiting got outsourced.

If managers got fired for having a labor shortage or not getting shit done, maybe shit would get cleaned up. Firing managers for not getting work done would stop DEI crap too, because DEI hires don't do squat in the office. Plus this would actually justify their anger with employees not doing shit.

Right before the Olympics started this year I saw news articles pass by about the IOC being worried about the future of the olympics. How they need to target not only modern athletes, modern sports but also a modern audience.

The the opening ceremony happened, after that the hermaphrodite boxers final and now this, a clear photo op for a modern audience, who according to (((experts))) love diversity.

Modern audience, this term sounded familiar. In fact, I heard this term being used many times the last few days watching videos on YouTube. Then it hit me, "appealing to a modern audience" is used a lot in the gaming space as a defense of game developers who either consulted DEI/BRIDGE consultants and/or gamedevs who want more diversity in their games.

So I did some minor digging and found the IOC made a strategy plan to appeal to modern athletes and modern audiences.
It's called Agenda 2020+5.

In pic related you can see a few keypoints of their strategy to accomplish their goals. I highlighted a few suspicious strategies they are using.
We should do some digging bois.
Who did they consult making the roadmap for agenda 2020+5?
What are the 40 recommendations they talked about in their meeting?

Something feels off

It has been our observation for many years now that white men have zero political representation. Neither party in the US supports white men, and both are pandering to just about every group except white men. Even in the UK, that Rwandan jogger stabbed a bunch of white children, and the political class there tried to appease Muslims. Our ancestors built the west, but every group except us is given preferential treatment. This attitude does not just exist in politics, with DEI policies at most companies, virtually no one is hiring white men, ESPECIALLY new grads trying to get started in their field. They keep down white men because historically we are effective at standing up to them.

White men, it’s bad but don’t give up, but we need a new approach. We need to start villainmaxxing. They already treat us like villains just for existing, time to actually embrace being villains. No longer do we begrudgingly uphold a rigged social contract that has been hijacked by Jews with the intent of keeping white men down, fuck that. Every other group uses exploitation and trickery to get ahead, so we do the same. Time to outjew the jews at their own game. Upon seeing the laws and talking to others with this mindset, below is a list of possible ways to LEGALLY exploit the current order for our own gain. These tricks not only work to varying degrees for many people, but make jews and normies seethe for added bonus.

>Lie about your race on a college/job application meant for DEI hires
>Use LEGAL tax loopholes to pay the least amount of taxes or take advantage of the system

The problem here is that Pete Buttigieg is a Mckenzie stooge trained to let things like this slide because the obvious problem was lack of regulation and prioritizing profit over safety. The rail industry famously says "safety's fourth" and they had the technology to upgrade their breaking system but they pushed against the Obama era attempt to raise break standards to meet advances in technology. So the Obama, Trump, and Biden administration let them have their way.

Pete was absent, offering no comment and the media avoided it. Who covered it? Rightwing media quick to blame DEI. Both sides of the MSM and politics protected corporate interest at the expense of public safety. So glad the VP pick isn't Buttigieg.

>How many people in /pol/ have luxury cars like lamborghinis, ferraris or mclarens?

I owned a Ferrari once - early 2000s, IPO money. Nice car, but a nightmare to own and maintain - I only drove it for about 3000 miles a year and it wasn't worth what it took to maintain it. I am at least 10x higher in net worth since then. For the last 20 years, my daily drivers have been a series of AMG station wagons with no badges. Don't need anything else. The wife usually drives some kind of Lexus or other.

My politics have always been centrist-right, but that puts me in the far-right now. US Constitution. Small Government. 1A. 2A.
Gays can fuck each other in the arse, I don't care.
Market capitalism is good.
Legal immigration is good IF it is done for our benefit. (H1B is a scam)
Corporations become evil when they get large.
DEI is poison.

Have multiple secret societies and rackets from the supply chain faction that uses your typical grocery stores and delivery businesses to spy and maybe poison those who are normal people and opposed to nigger worship. No seriously, don’t DoorDash your groceries, you’re asking to get nigger poisoned, are you dumb?

Oh yeah, Joe Biden getting poisoned right in front of our eyes by niggers so they can push Kamala and get more free DEI nigger money.

But they'll never do that. They'll never admit they fucked up. So they will have to resort to mandatory military service or else let the army fall apart. Because there's absolutely no way white Americans are ever going to volunteer again, and the army depended on white Americans to keep it going.

Pic related is proof that Tesla has a DEI-Programm, while Elon publicly denounces DEI.
It's a snipped from my "Inside Tesla"-Account.

I work at Elons factory close to Berlin and the factory is taken over by Turks and Arabs, of the four German superiors i had, three where made to leave with a severence package and the last one is an insecure supervisior who wears a "diversity" bracelet as visible as possible, in an effort to appeal to his turkish overlords.

This situation came about after the german superiors kept on refusing to scam workers for their vacation days and other things.

So they promoted a bunch of turks, arabs and other muslims, because most of them can barely write or know how to use a computer, let alone having any idea how employement law works and what rights workers have.

This is 100% true. If Charles came out supporting the riots it would be a historic moment and civil war would ensue with certainty. The thing is Charles would win with the backing of the loyalist military while the ZOG would only have the police and the secret services on their side which are ridden with competency crisis and DEI management so they would be bound to lose.

Charles will not do it because he is probably too afraid and cowardly. His silence will further the erosion of the Monarchy among their last supporting demographic (white working class) and soon enough the royals will be deposed by the ZOG-muslim alliance.

No, I don't believe in things with zero evidence like alien empires. If it's not fine-tuned for humans, then what you're arguing falls apart, because no imago Dei, humans at the centre of God's plan, etc.
No, it is not a coincidence that every Biblical prophecy does not fulfill even the first criteria an impartial researcher would consider to see whether something can even qualify as a prophecy, let alone that it was fulfilled. For example, there is literally no way for you to even verify Jesus actually said that, instead of just being added later. Whenever this most basic criterium is fulfilled, even super weak attempts at proving prophecies, like things you can influence yourself, guess from probability, etc, fail. Probably because prophets have never existed in the history of humanity.
There are at least six ways to look at supposed fine-tuning: design theories, multiverse theories, anthropic theories, brute fact theories, inherent teleology, dissolving the question (cognitive bias, epistemological bias, etc). Even if a design theory is true, it presents zero evidence on its own that there is a transcendent, absolute cause, let alone that it is the Christian God.

Kin based altruism confers advantages and European/Western society doesn’t practice it, while all others do. Non Euros have developed sophisticated excuses to continue practicing kin based altruism at the expense of the host Euro population. Things like anti-colonialism, DEI are all forms. What this means is none of these people actually care about these concepts (their ancestors practiced slavery, committed genocide, colonized others) but simply logically back into them because they work on Euro societies. Ironically the only people who do take them seriously are Euros themselves.
We can see this in action in Ireland, who have not only never colonized others but were colonized for a thousand years and are still subjected to the same treatment.

Simply put, it’s an ethnic group strategy deployed not because it is true, but because it works on you

Agreed fully, the “DEI is antisemitic” point is perfect. Jews had this foolish idea that they would hold this position as the most oppressed people permanently due to the Holocaust myth.

You're very correct, which is why jews have pivoted to "DEI is anti semitic", which is screaming at their own invention.

We'll probably get a kosher nationalism in the coming months/yrs as the sign tappers get vindicated, either intentionally or indirectly, and conflict continues to escalate in the middle east.

Elon Musk was originally a liberal who supported the Democratic Party.
But then the Democratic Party descended into bottomless sexual depravity and identity politics, and DEI led to his son's transgenderization into a woman.
And while Biden supports green energy, he totally dislikes Tesla and Elon. refuses to give Tesla more green energy subsidies.
This led him to start liking Trump more and he prefers normal people to LGBTQ+ transgender crazies.

Bro that's mostly just common sense maxxing. Villain maxxing would be something like selling dangerous drugs to nigger ghettos or something, aka, using villainy to achieve your racial or political goals. Or helping niggers get access to cheap firearms so they can accelerate their own self nigger annihilation. I dunno that's just off the top of my head, but- none of these are worth the risk

Makes sense, they have enough bugman gamers on their home turf to completely offset the loss of any funding the jews might have thrown their way. And China still makes 95% of the plastic garbage the world uses, so in terms of the big picture they have no reason to sacrifice their games for a few shekels more. China is still winning that race.

Villainmaxxing is NOT about committing crimes either violent or petty like joggers do, especially when there are plenty of perfectly legal ways to game the system and get ahead. Everything I listed above as an example is a low risk + high reward scheme, and has helped a lot of people with varying degrees of success. People in other threads have put shoplifting as a possible way to do this, but that is NOT part of villainmaxxing. Not only is shoplifting an 85 IQ jogger-tier high risk + low reward scheme that will likely end in you being caught and prosecuted, it often hurts people who aren’t contributing to the problem. After all, Joe’s Country Store probably isn’t contributing to the problem. Compare that to a real example of villainmaxxing like lying about race or sexual identity on a job application, the worst thing that could possibly happen is they call your bluff and you don’t get hired, which is the risk, or you could get hired for a DEI position and now be making good money that you otherwise would not have gotten as the reward. Remember, low risk + high reward is key. Anything that involves breaking laws is probably high risk as it puts you on law enforcement’s radar.

This is the mindset shift though. Instead of obeying laws because we think some greater good comes out of it, or because we believe in muh democracy or something gay like that, if we follow laws it’s to avoid altercations with law enforcement.

It has been our observation for many years now that white men have zero political representation. Neither party in the US supports white men, and both are pandering to just about every group except white men. Even in the UK, that Rwandan jogger stabbed a bunch of white children, and the political class there tried to appease Muslims. Our ancestors built the west, but every group except us is given preferential treatment. This attitude does not just exist in politics, with DEI policies at most companies, virtually no one is hiring white men, ESPECIALLY new grads trying to get started in their field. They keep down white men because historically we are effective at standing up to them.

White men, it’s bad but don’t give up, but we need a new approach. We need to start villainmaxxing. They already treat us like villains just for existing, time to actually embrace being villains. No longer do we begrudgingly uphold a rigged social contract that has been hijacked by Jews with the intent of keeping white men down, fuck that. Every other group uses exploitation and trickery to get ahead, so we do the same. Time to outjew the jews at their own game. Upon seeing the laws and talking to others with this mindset, below is a list of possible ways to LEGALLY exploit the current order for our own gain. These tricks not only work to varying degrees for many people, but make jews and normies seethe for added bonus.

This, just this. She was ultra Christian (I don't know if you know Opus Dei), and I was, let's say, agnostic. I would try to argue with her because her beliefs seemed irrational to me, I didn't take her seriously, I didn't sacrifice for her (I didn't accompany her to church, mostly), and anyway, we had a different vision for the future (raising children in religion, marriage, premarital sex, etc.). In spite of everything, she did certain things, to satisfy me, because she loved me, even though they contravened or were not in line with her principles. I, however, was unable to do the same. Nor did I try to stop her, even though I knew that what she was doing was hurting her. If I could go back in time.... Do you know what it's like to have lost someone (someone you only value after you've lost them), and to know that you'll never find anyone like them?

1. Birth rates have been declining for decades.
2. Wage suppression.
3. Low labor force participation (NEET).
4. Low military enrollment.
5. Higher inflation.
6. Property value inflation.
7. Civil rights / DEI.
8. Formation of political patronages (ie welfare class / dependents).
9. “Growth”.

Bureaucrats, politicians, and officials are careerists. Padding their CV’s with “achievements” and-or receiving money comes before ideological commitments and loyalties. These people will vie each other at a moments notice if doing so behooves them. Right now mass migration behooves *every* government agency and institution, as well as the interests of private corporations. The only way this stops is: 1) mass migration becomes less profitable or attractive, 2) invoking exception at the federal level which forcibly remigrates or imprisons migrants, or 3) widespread indomitable resistance and reaction.

Mostly this. We have to work with POC and DEI starting from universities and obviously high paying jobs are like that as well. Most of us used to think that the odd one doesn't matter but lately the number of smelly DEI folk has reached critical mass in our environments. High IQ often correlates with high income, unless you're into drugs that is, which means we tend to live in the better neighborhoods and even countries, so normally we do not have to interact with POC or we have been able to keep it down to the bare minimum.

But every high IQ person I have ever known, has been racist. And they don't want hordes of niggers and Muslims, or jeets, or anyone they view as subhuman. It's tricky, because at the same time we must keep this act going, to avoid being cancelled by the system.

I salute all the white trash who have no such restrictions and can be happily racist openly.

OWS was the last organic movement on the left. There was serious traction in the beginning from both sides of the political spectrum. Obama ran on OWS goals saying he was going to hold the investment firms and bankers accountable for their crimes. Of course, nothing happened except the banks and investment firms turned into Democrat co-conspirators as opposed to Republican ones. This is how the shift to the left was accomplished in state houses in Cali, Penn and NY. Democrats would play ball if you let Jews and niggers do whatever they wanted. Of course this also meant getting rid of whitey. DEI, ESG etc came out of the devil’s deal Obama did with Wall Street.

Because the higher iq people live around higher iq or wealthier people. Multiculturalism works when everyone is upper middle class because everything is piss easy and to get there you cant be a retard. So they only see the good people of other cultures. A good example was Indians and Chinese being smart until recently. There was such selective pressure for those countries not many retards could slip through. So with that bias you'd think everyone in china and india are geniuses.

>stupid poor black
> fuck whitey
> middle class black see dei incentive
> fuck whitey
> some whites at all economic and iq level see
> Whites noticing are banned for being racist
> to climb education or corporate later you must be silent
> lets rabid lefty dogs to bark all the time
> you only see these people screaming pro immigration

Now the opposite version
> low iq white bans together
> zog crushes it
> all involved will not be employable

There are plenty of people who hate this, but literally can't fucking say it outside of small hangouts or this contianment board.

Also the social "sciences" strike down anti diversity shit all the time. You are not allowed in if you disagree. I didn't really hold this belief until getting older when I and many cohorts saw this happening.

I will say blind racism is retarded. To insinuate that all blacks are stupid is ignorant and wrong(factually).

Saying a society that looks out for people of my race/culture will likely lead to stronger community ties and a better chance at me and my children prospering is not.

Houthis sink another vessel. Russia takes another 30 metres of land. Zelensky does another model photoshoot asking why Europe doesn't do more. Shitskins in the UK get BTFO. The fire rises.

Why is it so hard for people just to be normal for 5 seconds.
I might not be the most successful but I make it a damn important point to take care of my family and extended family.
I'll help out even black grannies opening the door or making sure they get the groceries in their car.
But I am a White nationalist and National Socialist and I make no attempts to appease minorities or to make excuses for what I believe in.
We need a White Homeland, England should be for the English, and so on and so forth for every European country.
Why is it impossible for these retards to stop in fighting and trying to make an appeal to their enemy constantly.
>>477056366
America was founded by men who thought no one other than White men of good character would be able to govern and vote for any effective state, but that doesn't even matter anymore.
You might be a little slow but America is over brother, it's toast the thing you call America is a corpse.
The leftists and liberals are rooting for the maggots eating it and the Civic nationalists kosher conservatives are rooting for the rotting corpse.
The putrid rot of DEI and diversity hires culminating in the competency crisis is flooding the nostrils of even the most normie conservatives.
The data is in, the experiment of a multiracial or multicultural society and democracy has been a complete and utter failure.
I don't care about the current "American" Empire I have no interest in participating in an Empire that rules over a multicultural mess having to enforce diversity with state power.
It's so sad seeing people "standing up" against the jews and then wanting to implement explicitly jewish policies just without kikes behind them.
Multicultural democracies are a jewish project and anyone who wants to take over simply just wants to become the new jew.
ZOG needs to be destroyed and the non-Whites need to be separated or physically removed by any means necessary.

Here's a toast to the most inclusive and progressive administration of all time. Both DIE and not DEI depending on the day. For they brought us the greatest politico of all time!

Today, we salute you, the one true patriot of this nation, for bravely and -stunningly- representing the increasingly diverse and inspiring crossdressing kleptomaniac segment of society. We thank you for showing us what is possible, and that nothing is impossible.

Truly, we are blessed. As our wise Momola once said ~ We understand the significance of time, as it comes before and after us, and the importance of understanding this significance and the way it was significant before and significant after. And it is because of this significance that we are here, now, and not later because it is not now.

Truly we are blessed. You can do anything. Anything is possible. Follow your dreams. Suck them. Fuck them. Fuck them raw. Fuck your dreams so hard you become something you never even wanted to be and you can stand there deer in the headlights, laughing, because you're the king. You're the queen. You. Now get out there and get rich or at least die fucking. Your dreams of course. Fuck them raw.

I don’t know why the fuck they put a poo in charge of Arc. Raja was a meme internally. I’m tired of braindead corporate fucks like these getting DEI’d into leadership positions and having no soul or passion for what they’re in charge of. Nobody knows how to lead in any organization I’ve been in. It’s all status quo.
I’ve never been at a company that had a visionary that wanted to achieve greatness. It’s always been a constant ADHD tier shift in focus every month, trying to chase the next trend basically instead of creating their own. Nobody has a budget to do anything anymore either. Every single project I’ve been on has always been understaffed, underequipped, and rushed.

Murderer was a nigger of nigger parenta that should never have been here.

People are protesting about immigrants that we not only didn't ask for but explicitly asked not for, taking 80% of social housing, being protected by the police on a two tier system while they do atrocious crimes against the natives that the media refuses to cover leading to an awareness bias, refusing to assimilate and openly hating the indigenous Britons for our race and the far left simply callingbus names for mentioning it.

That's just for starters. People are pissed of at woke and dei in companies which enables all this, they are upset about rigged elections where they aren't represented in parliament, our councils giving all our money to foreigners then declaring they are bankrupt and can't do what we pay them to do. Generally our population is too high, the country is sliding into a thirds world shit hole, because we appear to have the third world people here.

She worked as a senator, prosecutor, attorney general, and district attorney. In contrast, Trump is a failed businessman and convicted felon with zero political experience. If Trump was a black and if Kamala was white, you would call the former a DEI hire. Since it's the other way around though, you ignore any achievement she has while unconditionally supporting Trump despite him failing to achieve any political stances that he advocated for.

>You're also retarded if you think that cultural differences between Africans and Europeans don't matter, but the fact that you think a black with two Rwandan parents is as 'native born' as a white English person who can trace their ancestry back to their home country hundreds of years is already telling enough
What part of Rwandan culture tells people to murder underage white girls in a dance club?

Can't give an answer to both questions because none of your beliefs or talking points are based in reality. Just in double standards, pseudoscience, and fake facebook posts.
>I'm not British and I don't care for their monarchy. Nonces should be strung up alongside child-murdering niggers
Doesn't matter what you personally think, what matters is that racists act on their double standard between their race and the other. That's why they're mad at a nobody, but not at a white rapist. That's why they support felon Trump, but consider Obama/Kamala to be corrupt DEI hires.

To them, whites are the second coming of Christ regardless of their actions and brown people are demons regardless of what they do. It's not rational in the slightest to anyone who thinks about it.

To return to a comparison I’ve made before, imagine a pre-DEI hire aviation industry after a plane had flown into a mountain. A jumbo jet has 6 million parts, and every one of those parts has been through quality control checks, cleaning, and testing. Planes do not fly into mountains very often, and there is a reason for that: every time, they have the aviation industry meticulously and painstakingly accounted for every single vector of hazard and reported their findings intending to decrease the chances of a repeat disaster in the future. Was the pilot depressed or going through a messy divorce? Was he a drunk? Had somebody cut costs or outsourced key equipment to a shady cut-price merchant?

In Britain, the multicultural plane hasn’t just flown into the mountain on multiple occasions; the government will call you an extremist if you point out the oil belching from the fuselage or the duct tape holding the chassis together.

When news began to trickle onto social media that an atrocity had taken place in Southport, there was, inevitably, a lot of half-truths and scampering to find the correct narrative frame. The liberals picked up on the fact that the perpetrator was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents. Therefore, he wasn’t an immigrant but a Welshman. Yet, allowing somebody to claim they’re “as British as you” via bureaucratic mandate is only to fall back on a previously established lie that the native population had no say in or control over. Furthermore, once the passport and paperwork have been filed, it is quite literally a crime to argue that an in-group and an out-group exist unless it is to the benefit of the minority group, such as recognising that they face discrimination.

shitskins can do all the shit work they want, they just can't have any rights, visa/residency/citizenship, and of course no voting. This is not due simply to white supremacy but economic reality.

The moment you "legalize" them, they have no economic incentive to work for $2/hour. If you want migrants fine, just keep them in the shadows and away from society I don't mind, but the moment you start with your DEI, amnesty, and the rest of the bullshit you lose not only me but market forces as well

It's going back into the federal reserve bank who then buys back the stock at a lower price. It's called corporate buy backs, but the entire stock market is owned by the federal reserve now, so they tank the stock by selling off shit, triggering a panic, you dump your stock making it worse, then they buy the remaining stock for less than you'd have ever sold it to them without the panic. Federal Reserve Bank ownership of the stock market goes from 94.5% to 96.2% or whatever. And you are left poorer than ever. Then they use that control over the capital of the entire economy to force more DEI and replace the white race. With Jews you loose. Don't play the stock market. Don't buy bonds. Don't buy gold or silver. Don't buy commodities. Buy real things that help your real family. Tools, trucks, land, water, houses, clothes, long term dry food, shit like that.

If they were a cartel they were at least organized but Biden left behind tons of equipment in Afghanistan, then they're running out of equipment to give to Ukraine and have no plan what to achieve or how to quit there. Meanwhile they start operation Prosperity Guardian only to get BTFO and then they send 4 carrier groups to Israel's support while Ukraine loses its war and Taiwan is still a thing they also care (?) about because they didn't strategically secure their chip production but also they rely on Asia to stock up their weapons and tech, so if they start a war now they have none ready, aside from the competency crisis kicking in due to DEI hires and the military being low on recruits despite lowered requirements. A cartel would at least invest in its own strength and try to plan instead of leaving it to companies to do whatever, which led to the technology and wealth transfer with China, which is why that's a thing now. I don't know what the West is these days others than on a moral high horse while being morally bankrupt.

Thing is, she doesn't understand the other threat of having too many foreigners in one's country. In America and Canada's case, they worm their way into jobs, government, institutions, media, education, etc., where they proceed to practice their own form of "systemic privilege" while hiding behind DEI or diversity initiatives. Jews are the worst of this, but others, such as Indians, are proving to be just as bad. They LOVE the idea of our retarded older generations throwing their youth under the bus so they can move right in and wrest our nations from us, again, under the guise of diversity and kumbaya multiculturalism.

Another good example of this are lawyers. Many human rights and immigration lawyers here in the US are either Jewish or foreign themselves. They come here and basically act like trojan horses, subverting from within.

The entire concept of being a "nation of immigrants", i.e. determining that your own people are replaceable and thus don't matter, is tantamount to civilizational suicide. Yet it has a firm grip on many in the West.

Boomers were the generation who--while perhaps not hit hardest with the white self-hate and globohomo kumbaya diversity propaganda--they are the generation who grew up and benefited the most from the ideologies and institutions that are now failing their future young people. In other words they gained the most from greed and selling out their future, thus there is no benefit for them to question it; they believe it, it worked for them.

Besides, as they like to say, they'll be long gone by the time the chickens come home. It's the same here in the US, btw. Occasionally I meet some absolutely insufferable shitlib Boomer who was young in the 60s and 70s, who are still die-hard believers of multi-culti, DEI, and LBJ's civil rights bullshit. They're the type who will make comments like
>Oh god, we whites have been so horrible. Who cares if we become a minority or go extinct? It'll probably be a good thing, considering how much we ruined the world.
Self-hate to the core.

Some ex Scotland Yard guy was on some shitty media interview other day and said cops are disorganized with shit leaders (dei strikes again) and that 48hrs ago there were intel reports they were going to riot at that hotel but sent women and the comedy force to it that was blown out.
This means it's all one big shitshow the entire gov and this guy seems way to nutless to do anything about it so the riots will continue until he resigns in panic

1. they rape at astronomical levels per capita, 4x the next worse race and 30x white people
2. when they aren't raping at astronomical levels, they're dming every single girl on Instagram trying to fuck them, extremely creepily. at least 50% of them are actively repulsive and creepy to girls
3. they're hired for being cheap, but even the top level h1bs are completely incompetent and incapable of higher thought. they are essentially like a shitter version of chatgpt, and require 24/7 surveillance by white people to get anything done
4. they are completely filthy, their homes smell disgusting for years after they leave, they eat with their filthy hands and wipe their anuses without toilet roll with the same filthy hands, you will often see them leave the bathroom without washing their hands, if they aren't shitting in the street. in their country they don't even use toilets, they use holes in the ground
5. they smell fucking terrible
6. they contribute nothing to culture. at least black people make good minstrels. their music is terrible, cinema is terrible, festivals are terrible, ugly language, ugly accents, no art of note ever
7. never invented anything good in the past 2000 years "we invented the number 0" is their cope
8. nepotistic and rude to their host, don't respect their host cultures. mistreat their women and children. second ugliest race too
9. their only unique hobby is sticking a giant punto onto a fiat punto and wearing gaudy gold and using fake medicine
10. unlike east asians who want to be white and inventive and civil, they want to emulate blacks, they want to be cool, they want to rap and street race, they are just too cringe to ever succeed at it. even their most famous indian aziz ansari is just like "I... I met jay z and stood cringely in the back of the Otis video. I heard 50 cent order grapefruit juice". all their celebs are just DEI hires
11. at home they do nothing productive, just run scams. deport them all, rapists can't stay

In any case, I'm a manager at an engineering firm. There are no DEI points for hiring pajeets so I shred every single jeet resume I get, even the IIT-educated ones. I haven't even so much as given a jeet an interview, let alone hired one. I'll hire a nigger before I hire a pajeet.

So what you're saying is that for Kamala to win, she'll need:

>A VP from a Party that threw out moderates in favor of Nepotism and DEI
>A Debate with Trump where she is likely going to get streamrolled with both facts and dunks
>That same Unicorn VP completely mopping the floor with Vance.

At least that third one has a good possibility of occuring. I think she'll have to stick with media shilling. It suits the rest of her artificial campaign.

You guys know that Lamala is going to be terrible right? Not just for the Jews and Israel, not just for Wall Street and investment vc and banking money, and not just for MIC.

She and her sycophant backers are going to be terrible for America overall. Stop coping with the delusions of you’ll survive her, you’ll make it work, you’ll somehow get by despite the additional layers of retarded and moronic nigger dei candidates she’ll install (oh and I found out recently that dei was for disabled, real disenfranchised minority groups, mentally handicapped and physicall handicapped, not just niggers despite what blacks say).
No, you’ll “survive” as you’re being pushed further down on a slippery downward slope. That’s not livid or surviving. You’re basically enduring a hostile occupation force and a hostile faction who is continuously making power plays to rule the government.

You’re just giving in, and giving the “people” who hate this country and hate all of you and me more time, money, resources, and more influences

woke was created by the marxist frankfurt school in the mid 20th century
it took until the 90's to become mainstream but it was behind the civil rights movement, sexual revolution and lgbt rights (from the 60's to the 90's)
in the early 20th century europe frankfurt school created the critical theory, which is analysis of politics through a material marxist analysis (this created the anti-imperialist movement which mostly was focused on the west because the west used africa and the americas for resources which left them poor)
around the mid to late 20th century frankfurt school thought was evolved to become the critical RACE theory in america, unlike the critical theory which looked at things from a class and material perspective, now a new racial aspect is added where instead of capitalists/imperialists being on top of the chain as people who opress others its instead white people, and the darker races are now the new victims (instead of poor people)
this quickly created things like affirmative action, demand for reperations and black nationalist movements like the black panthers (which were also a marxist movement) and all of these things become popular around the mid to late 20th century (70's and onwards) with the 90's making them fully mainstream
all of this thought spread to the internet around the early 2010's with tumblr taking over it (along with transgender thought promoted by john money which also started around the mid 20th century with some other sexologist/sociologists)
most of the sjw and other "woke" shit you see was amplified by tumblr, they made the ideas of white guilt popular online, same with the idea of there being million genders, they made gender/sexuality flags a thing etc
the tumblr stuff went fully mainstream online in 2014 with gamergate followed by 2015/2016 trump stuff
gamergate made people take woke shit serious and the woke then took over corporations (from games to capitalist products) and now you have DEI/diversity hires everywhere

6000 of the 20,000 officers recruited under BoJo are gone.
7000 more intend to leave by the end of 2025. Some areas now only have 11 police officers for 70,000 people. Others have no local officers at all.

5200 Met Police officers intend to leave by next summer.

At this rate there will be no police left. Those being recruited are all DEI,manlets,basedboys,lesbians,trans and whatever the fuck quota you tick.

The military is similar aswell, 10693 joined in 2023. 16414 left in 2023. Recruitment is down everywhere.

Gender wars/segregation and "globohomo", the reality Anonymous ID:qXvB1rg/ Sun 04 Aug 2024 15:15:01 No.476945099  Replies: 1 ViewReport
Assuming you're not retarded (*I bite my knuckle for a moment in consideration then continue*) globohomo means globalization + homogenization. This has of course been bastardized into globalism + homosexuality, though it isn't far off. A lot of guys are under the impression that the globalist agenda is Marxist and promotes femininity. This is retarded, but that's probably what you're being meant to think so it isn't your fault. In reality, science is breaking new ground fast and causing things like religion and the need for women reproductively, and more, to be challenged, it is making religious/reproductive pillars go defunct. In addition to the Africa stuff, this is another reason why DEI is being shoved in your face while simultaneously we somehow keep seeing women actually being pushed OUT of women's spaces (including the Olympics) and scaled back to like, the home and trad-wifery. Even though religion is certifiably extinct to anyone with a brain, we keep seeing men with platforms pushing for religion because it's being used as a weaponized tool to strong-arm and enact race & gender wars. Elite men know women are on course of becoming not necessary and want men to be ... (fill in the blank). Because of this Gender Homogenization, bi & homosexuality is actually just an implication of that, par for the course, a natural inevitability. Notice how there suddenly will be gay football leagues and more types of men's leagues. This is why a healthy embracing of all types of masculinity is key going forward, and the globohomo howler apes probably don't even realize they're shooting themselves in the foot by being so turned off by all things "homo" to the point of screeching about globohomo which basically makes you an honorary female, congrats. So if you see Ryan Reynolds talking about bicon Marlon Brando, or Hugh Jackman's ass, or Chris Evans. Or MrBeast having scandals involving women, maybe nixing female involvement in his competition shows entirely, this may be why.

Your Bubbie will greet you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They’ll bury you with a headstone engraved with the Stars and Stripes, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know an American is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a failed state that was unmistakably genocidal.This is your fate. This is what you chose.

I also don’t think the democrats think they can win. The economy is a disaster, people have less money in their bank accounts, and inflation is out of control. Also, there has been a huge backlash towards “woke” politics. People are sick of it. A couple of years ago PRIDE stuff was everywhere in June, this year it was much more subdued.

>the British are about to send their security forces and foederati immigrant armies to massacre the british people for not tolerating immigrant invaders

What was the massacre of Thessalonika? Theodosius I welcomes the gothic invaders as part of the roman empire and the goths immediately start pushing boundaries, with the people of Thessalonika losing patience and refusing to provide the goths with free gibs and accepting to be lorded by them. Then the gothic leader made foederati commander of roman armies starts jailing popular anti-gothic personalities over random charges such as being a faggot (this was a retcon to make the protesters look like they were defending a sinner, just like journalists do to delegitimize dissent) while tolerating gothic crime, which leads the people of Thessalonika to chimp out into a race war and riot. To end the crisis and restore order to the roman alt righht, a ROMAN EMPEROR sends his diverse army of roman and goths to MASSACRE a roman city, killing 700 romans.

The crisis further weakens the imperial authority, which allows for the Catholic Church to force Theodosius I to sign in the THEODOSIAN DECREES (the ultimate DEI education reform), outlawing the old roman faith and creeds and temples, as a way to assure stability and crush the roman violent resistance. It was the roman equivalent of peak clown world, with the elites tripling down on multiculturalism by forcing you to accept foreigners are your brothers.

We are watching this right now repeat itself in the Britannia, and soon in the USA, as the now army composed mostly of foederati migrants wanting a job and free food will eventully be sent by Washington DC to fight the american people.

After all, if there is only a small number of 'far right extremist thug' against immigration, they wont fear a referendum on it, will they? Also, such a referendum should give opportunity to vote to those citizens born in the UK. We need referendums on many issues in order to put the country back on it's feet. Things like the pay rises that murdering nhs cunts get? Id take money off these cunts and put them on performance related pay and if they dont like, they can fuck off and if they dont meet targets, objectives or if they mistreat patients, they are fucking out on their arse. The line that we need immigrants for the nhs is an absolute fucking lie. They need them because THEY put DEI employment number targets into the recruitment equation and they have been doing that for decades.

Simple explanation is this. When rates are 0%, then it makes sense to invest your money in a business that turns 5% profit. That's a pretty miserable rate of return, but it's better than nothing. When rates rise to 5% though, no one will invest in said business, because the "risk free" rate of return is 5% on treasuries. So the business needs to turn at least a 8% or more profit depending on how risky it is. The whole economy works this way. That's how cap rates are figured on real estate.

Most of those businesses barely penciled out when rates were low. That's why they were all on interest only loans, the business didn't even make sense when they were paying principle on the mortgage. Then the Fed started hiking rates. Now all of those interest only mortgages start to roll over to higher rates.

https://archive.is/Qgrvn

Now all of those inefficient businesses with DEI hires that can barely turn a 5% profit die.

Jesuits are a branch of the masons, yes.
Big responsible for the tainting and corruption in the Church of our Holy Lord Jesuscrist.
But they arent the masons by himselves nigger.
Masons operate in national delegations all acrooss the globe tvem tgey have branches for every aspect or thingy.
Catholic ones are the Jesuits and Opus Dei. Protestants dont know but probably much much much muuchy moar. Orthodox dont have this kind of suvbersion, they have the contrary... ultra giga tradicionalist sects inside orthodoxy.
Im a catholic but i have my eye on the orthodoxy if the Church of Jesuscrist falls to Satan completely., but I think that dont end up happening cuz too much shit is starting to happen nao.

Almost all the actual coppers have left. All that's left are foreign mercenaries, busybodies and DEI larpers. That's why the response is so inept. Instead of letting this fizzle out they immediately went for the riot tactics without enough numbers, forced all the protesters round back and kicked the whole thing off. Other anon is right, a DEI squaddie who can't hold an SA80 would be maximum acceleration.

Why can't women do all of those things? They get more views per youtube video than men, people will hire them to any job to fill their DEI quotas of 30% women, they can, at any time, just record themselves doing their normal daily routine shower, shave, and even eating and get paid for it. Plus they can, at any time, attach themselves to a man with money if they decide to simply retire at 25.

In a western pampered society, their advantages are far better. Especially in the US where they can carry a gun. That just about erases any advantages men have over them and they get to keep theirs

The US Air Force's F-35 Lightning II fighter jet has struggled with reliability and maintainability in recent years:
Mission capable rate
In 2023, the F-35A's mission capable rate was 51.9%, down from 71.4% in 2020. The "combat-coded" portion of the fleet, which should be ready to fight at any time, had a rate of only 48%.
Mean flight hours between critical failures
The F-35A fleet was supposed to achieve a rate of 20 mean flight hours between critical failures after 75,000 fleet hours, but in 2023 it only achieved 10.5.
Maintenance and repair
Some reports say that maintenance and repair problems ground F-35 jets 45% of the time. The program also lacks the capacity to efficiently repair aircraft when they break.
Software
The F-35 relies on software for maintenance, but the system isn't working properly. The program is also delayed in updating the aircraft's software.
Other issues
Other issues include inventory management failures, a battery that gets too cold to operate in Alaska, and a night vision camera display that shows horizontal lines during low-light conditions.

>TLDR. The F-35 reliability rate is quite low around 50 percent. It's a piece of shit along with the DEI maintainers.

>According to Anthony:

>"Many of the qualities of Indo-Iranian god of might/victory, Verethraghna, were transferred to the god Indra, who became the central deity of the developing Old Indic culture. Indra was the subject of 250 hymns, a quarter of the Rig Veda. He was associated more than any other deity with Soma, a stimulant drug (perhaps derived from Ephedra) probably borrowed from the BMAC religion. His rise to prominence was a peculiar trait of the Old Indic speakers."

>Dyaus (Sanskrit: द्यौष्, IAST: Dyáuṣ) or Dyauspitr (Sanskrit: द्यौष्पितृ, IAST: Dyáuṣpitṛ́) is the Rigvedic sky deity. His consort is Prthvi, the earth goddess, and together they are the archetypal parents in the Rigveda

>Dyauṣ stems from Proto-Indo-Iranian *dyā́wš, from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) daylight-sky god *Dyēus, and is cognate with the Greek Διας - Zeus Patēr, Illyrian Dei-pátrous, or Latin Jupiter (from Old Latin Dies piter Djous patēr), stemming from the PIE Dyḗus ph2tḗr ("Daylight-sky Father")

>The noun dyaús (when used without the pitṛ́ 'father') refers to the daylight sky, and occurs frequently in the Rigveda, as an entity. The sky in Vedic writing was described as rising in three tiers, avamá, madhyamá, and uttamá or tṛtī́ya

>Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́ appears in hymns with Prithvi Mata 'Mother Earth' in the ancient Vedic scriptures of Hinduism

>In the Ṛg·veda, Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́ appears in verses 1.89.4, 1.90.7, 1.164.33, 1.191.6, 4.1.10. and 4.17.4. He is also referred to under different theonyms: Dyavaprithvi, for example, is a dvandva compound combining 'heaven' and 'earth' as Dyauṣ and Prithvi

Most of that money is still locked up behind DEI initiatives that they couldn't reach. They ended up shutting down their Columbus plant because they couldn't reach the racial quotas that were put in place.
Hell, the entirety of the CHIPS act might be the biggest piece of shit ever made. Chipmakers thought they could finally make manufacturing chips here work only for it to go tits up when no one could actually access the funds. TSMC shut down their Arizona plant too. Everyone is now moving to Japan because they'll work for peanuts and it doesn't have to answer the Taiwan question.
DEI fucked everything up. Now Gelsinger has to basically trash their entire DEI hiring base and go back to square 1 because they can't get that juicy government money (for now), but it might already be too late. The Japs are going to eat our lunch because the Biden admin was more concerned about lunch ladies making chips here than actually competing in the market.

>Harris graduated in 1986 with a degree in political science and economics. Harris then returned to California to attend the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly the University of California, Hastings College of the Law) through its Legal Education Opportunity Program (LEOP)

even if you ignore their academic and professional backgrounds, despite his age, trump is clearly better at thinking on his feet and grasps the direction and intent of a conversation at a much higher level.

Same with how they want 100% tariffs on foreign vehicles.

Why do you think most people were throughout history? It wasn't just because they were entitled greedy assholes who felt they had a claim to everything they saw. It was because the instinct of the guys who were racist for the sake of it were backed up by the scholarly observations of the men who were racist because that's what nature showed them. We've been tricked into adopting the morality of the slave caste, and now we're being overrun by them.

because money is printed and given to them. the white man pays both via inflation.
There are two economies right now, the shitskins love Democrats because they get a free ride and live a better lifestyle than most whites so who actually work to pay for it. DEI vs Whites.
Chances are Kamala will win because to DEIs the economy is great, and they put outnumber the whites who work and pay for it all. That's generally out LatAm shitholes go too, spics will keep voting for socialism until whites are made so poor they can't keep up the failing system anymore, then the spics end up in hovels

You fuckers are scrambling because nearly every Dem official currently serving is a DEI-retard who sucks at their job. That's why everything in the US is going to shit. You're running a bitch who got her job by extorting Biden over the death of George Floyd (with Obama's help). That's the ONLY reason she was made VP, she was the highest ranking DEI Dem in the party, in Biden's own words. She and Biden then filled the government with fags, trannies, and lefties and the country is crumbling because of it.

This is why Kamala is losing. You can point to any fake polls you like, the internal machine knows the truth, otherwise you all wouldn't be getting paid to be here.

>With high interest rates, it's hard for companies to expand, hire, invest, etc..
so? it still makes sense to dump the dead weight and replace them with white men
you just need the DEI collar to come off

>Meta and the other large tech firms would gladly hire pajeets and chinks if they can.
like i explained, it comes down to whether you need to actually perform or not

eg google doesn't really need to perform anymore. google search is established, android is established, youtube is established. as long as they can keep the lights on, as long as the services continue to run, they'll keep printing money forever.
amazon is mostly the same too. as long as the store works, as long as aws avoids any major outtages, as long as prime video keeps serving their filth, they're good.

but on the flipside, tesla needs to make cars, and they need them to work, and they need to improve them continuously to compete with the rest of the auto industry. and spacex needs to make rockets that fly and land and do all that cool shit. they can't rely on network effects like google can. they can't rely on one product selling another, like amazon (how many here have prime video because they have prime for the store?)
musks companies actually have to make shit that works, and works better than the competition, and is made to a competitive price. and you can't do that shit if you're carrying dead weight, or if you rely on 70iq jeets, no matter how cheap they are.

La storia del Tricolore ha inizioalla fine del Settecento. La nostra bandiera, infatti, trae ispirazione da quella della Francia, introdotta nel 1789 durante la Rivoluzione. I tre colori francesi – blu, bianco e rosso – furono scelti perché la milizia parigina, una sorta di esercito popolare fondato dai rivoluzionari, indossava una coccarda blu e rossa (i colori storici di Parigi), alla quale fu aggiunto il bianco, colore della Casa reale dei Borbone (si era ancora nella fase costituzionale della Rivoluzione e il re non era stato detronizzato). Nel 1790 l’Assemblea nazionale adottò ufficialmente la bandiera blu, bianca e rossa come emblema dello Stato.

Rappresentando la Francia della Rivoluzione, il Tricolore francese divenne un simbolo di libertàin tutto il mondo e alcune repubbliche adottarono bandiere a esso ispirate. Tra le altre, la Romania, il Messico, il Belgio e alcuni Stati fondati sul territorio italiano.

yeah idc what biden says publically. His action to instead cover up his faltering health for how long time let's say 6 months maybe a year. Instead of letting her step in and take over, which is what a vp is supposed to do. Except if you pick one who you never expect to be taking over at any point.
And then he gets stuck with her because african americans or indian americans or whatever is going to flip out if he says she's not good enough as he thought. It's all making way too much sense unfortunately.
And so to not upset da almighty polls (got to get the black vote, the black vote, the indian vote), they run her instead of biden. good lord.

The goofy bitch didn't even type that post. What was said and agreed to with Biden doesn't magically transfer to his DEI replacement. By Sept 10th some other Democrat puppet could be in her place.
We've all seen her debate, horribly. Homala can barely function when reading off a teleprompter. The fact she's not thrilled to have more prep time shows they are shitting themselves over being on Fox with a live audience. Probably cause ABC was giving her the questions in advance. Cope harder, bitch will look like the retarded clown she is.

You understand that chinese children can do the assembly work once trained right? That kind of job quickly weeds out shantiniquas and the like because they simply can't hang even though its simple work. I'm not saying it has to be white I'm saying you have a much bigger pool of workers incentivized to at least try to work vs people who they have to put suicide nets out for.

The Chinese and the Island Chinese exercise strictest policies in their chip fabs, and they treat their factory personnel like slaves while they're on campus. They're given dormitory sleeping so they can be tapped at a moment's notice if they need to work 18 hours instead of 12 hours today. There's a reason these factories began to install suicide nets and locking the door to the roof.
Meanwhile American chip fabs have to hire niggers who show up on the bus, scratch their ass while they're on the floor, argue it's racist to put on a clean work uniform inside the facility, many such problems arise.
Precision manufacturing requires bugmen. Plain and simple. Maybe some semi-autistic German stock if you're in a pinch. But American factories will not find these people to hire them...at least not while they have their DEI/ESG/BRIDGE requirements to make half the workforce be useless niggers and useless women while all the actual work is dumped onto Steve.

In order for White nationalism to succeed it requires large numbers of talented Whites to care more about their collective racial well being than their individual status in life of their access to consumer goods. Part of the problem modern Whites have is "bourgeoisie values" where one values how they are precised by wider society ie "status" and their access to consumer goods. The Whites most bribed by this are Whites who are intelligent and talented which allows them to get high paying jobs (yes, even with DEI and other anti-White hiring practices if you are capable you can still get a high paying job). A successful WN movement needs to convince those Whites that collective wellbeing is more important than individual status. This is easier in Europe than in America because of the hyper-individualism of American culture, this is something that needs to be destroyed for a successful WN movement to arise.

>like who coined the concept?
It got a foothold into the business world after a study by McKinsey which concluded that diversity was good for companies.
Then BlackRock and Wall Street started pushing it by saying they'd only invest on companies with high DEI rates (since, according to the aforementioned study, this is a good predictor of success).
However, the study has come under a lot of scrutiny and it turns out it was all made up. Despite it being discredited, however, it still persists for two reasons:
- There was an organized effort to teach people that "diverse teams see problems diversely, thus coming up with better solutions" but, of course, there's no organized effort to say "actually that was wrong lmao".
- We're past the point of no return, those who were hired for diversity reasons are only willing to hire for diversity reasons. Since they have large numbers in pretty much every company now, they're the de-facto executioners of DEI policy.

We know from leaked internal documents that DEI accomplishes a number of objectives:
* 1. Primarily, it caters to a liberal worldview, which is important for a pro-immigration (pro-business) philosophy, as will be explained in the following points. Many CEOs genuinely hold liberal beliefs, being inculcated in leftist universities.
* 2. It suppresses unionization. The internal documents don't speculate why this is the case, but this is absolutely acknowledged. Presumably, the mechanism is that a diverse group of people have difficulty banding together under a common cause. Having a high worker turnover rate is also conducive to suppressing unionization... which really makes you think.
* 3. Minorities are content with being paid less. That they also do a shittier job is seen as not mattering when every other corporation is also hiring them. Our only competitor is China, and our leaders presume they can just sanction it to death.
* 4. The HR market, as you've noticed, is huge, and needs to justify its existence somehow. It does this by micromanaging meaningless bullshit. On the other hand, if some of these things are not attended to, vexatious litigation will ensure that the company in question is sued into bankruptcy for not fulfilling an ape quota. It's legalized, state-sanctioned extortion, with the express intent of creating the illusion of apes in suits and ties accomplishing things.
* 5. The entire economy is similarly bullshit. DEI just exposes that. That the hiring process for these seemingly important positions is no more complex than the criteria for a Netflix television show SHOULD suggest to any intelligent person that these jobs are just that... shows. They are not real, and the economy is fake.

The only thing the government ever needs to do is cut taxes by x% every year. Even if it's just 1% per year, every year they will have to shed some fat (fire some DEI hires) until 20-30 years ago the country becomes an absolute superpower, and its citizen a superior class of humans, due to burning off the weak links within the system that do not produce, that are incompetent, retarded, or outright malicious.

To manifest this, you need LESS bureaucrats than we currently employ, which means that whoever wants to actually improve anything doesn't need any new tools at all.

Always been like this, yet you are being misled into thinking the opposite.

Anyone else remember when accelerationism was a thing? Those faggots should be wetting themselves right now:
- Olympics has become a tranny display of degeneracy and a shielder of pedos
- Israel practically invading its neighbours for the purpose of annexation
- The sitting US President has dementia
- One US Presidential candidate is a felon, the other is a DEI hire
- Mossad agent caught red handed blackmailing the rich and famous and was killed in a prison cell
- Open insider trading by US congress
- Naked bias and obvious public manipulation throughout the media and tech companies
- France ruled by Islam loving communists
- The entire western world funneling money into a Jewish Ukrainian comedian pockets while literally supporting neo-nazis
- Every single Hollywood movie being DEI workshop
- The USA has been caught illegally spying on more or less the entire world, including all Americans.
- Banning paper straws, plastic bags and hydrocarbon vehicles while fucking you with climate taxes
- Currency debased and the youth can no longer afford to buy a house
- Teachers and medicos manipulating children into being trannies
- Decriminalising pedophilia for gays
- US government bans most popular social media site as they allow criticism of jews
- Standards of living visibly dropping

My questiona for accelerationists is these: What is it going to take? Have you lost already?

You will likely die an unsuspecting death at the hands of a negro who will not be charged for killing you.
Perhaps a drunk bixnooder will crash into you, or maybe a hootin' and a hollerin' in a public setting will get out of hand and you will catch a stray bullet, maybe even a Nigger doctor with a DEI degree will botch your surgery and you'll pass from an infection.

All of that is to say, so long as you live in that shithole of a country, you will never truly be safe or happy.

DEI was and still is a failure and will never work. The hippies or star trek utopia will never happen because foreigners don't have compatible cultures. Even if these people don't cause serious problems, they behave poorly with loud talking and music, trashing everything, being selfish, not understanding local traditions, and not wanting to adapt. Nobody wants to live near these people. It will never work. It would have been better to negotiate with the places they came from and see if they can improve by themselves, and then we'd have better trading and understanding.

To those out of the loop this is why intel is undergoing such large cutbacks.

https://youtu.be/b6vQlvefGxk

>intel chips been having issues for the last two years minimum
>this has been stumping gamedevs and hardware partners for a long time
>intel almost managed to gaslight entire segments of industry from believing that intel is at fault and that it was the fault of microsoft for updated microcode in windows updates and motherboard manufacturers for not properly adhering to intels baseline specs
>more evidence comes out that not only do intel chips have oxidation issues that progressively destroy the chip, but intel chips have been designed way over spec and overvolted leading to faster wear and tear and eventually bricking of the processor
>This effects but is not limited to intel 13th and 14th gen chips. Mostly the K lines whos performance is unlocked.
>To make matters worse intel has not managed to provide adequate support to users and large companies who sourced chips from them.
>And any attempt to have open communication with intel is met with lies or radio silence.

So this has little to nothing to do with the current economic downturn or DEI policy. Although that probably isnt helping. They are getting absolutely ahegao fucked over this issue. Otherwise I dont think I could make it any more tl;dr than that.

I agree with the guy who made the post about the last great films being made in 1995, which I’ve evidently lost his post or it has been deleted. I’d say 2014 is the film industry’s dying breaths, but America’s cultural death started on 9/11. Has anyone else become something of a Luddite with games and media and the like? I’m comfy with culture ending in the 2010s, certainly not a high note, but whatever we have now is an anti culture. Keeping it with film and moving pictures, I’d wager that the overwhelming majority of television and film produced now suffers from the same basic problems…the biggest one is you cannot suspend your disbelief. Another problem is that there’s no tension or drama anymore. Most writing is either abysmal, or it panders in the worst ways imaginable or is a DEI wet dream. You can fill in the blanks. Personally, there’s part of me that may while there's time just make a list of films, buy every UHD Blu-ray I can and call it a day. I know Blu-ray’s are obsolescent, but I’m getting older and I could not care less about whatever nonsense is being made at this moment in time

Here's what he said (part 1):

>"It’s taken me a week to fully comprehend the genius of “White Women for Kamala” and “White Dudes for Harris.”
>One thing right-wingers love is to complain that you can only have affinity groups for blacks and other minorities. Whites sometimes feel like they’re being held to double standards and treated unfairly.
>Along comes the Kamala campaign and says it’s ok to be white. That is, as long as you’re a good person, which means supporting reproductive freedom, not being “weird,” and voting Democrat. We’re all in this together.
>It seems “woke” on the surface, but it’s actually a sign that liberals are moving away from woke. In 2020, something like this wouldn’t have even been possible. Talk of “whites” in left-coded spaces only occurred in the context of flogging them for their sins. In 2024, you can be a white dude for Kamala and it’s totally cool. The symbol for “White Dudes for Harris” is a trucker hat, showing self-deprecating humor and membership in a movement that is not at all weird or neurotic about race.
>White people receive the message that Democrats do not consider you the problem. You’re welcome into the coalition. There’s even a Zoom call you can join, and don’t worry, it won’t be just Robin DiAngelo telling you how much you suck. Kamala has made clear that she’s *only* considering white men for VP, and there couldn’t be a clearer signal that we’re past peak woke.
DEI therefore doesn’t always mean anti-white! Now you White Dudes get your own DEI pick, like everyone else.
>Republicans have been caught flat-footed. Conservatives want to portray these events as a kind of 2020 DEI struggle session, and they can find clips backing up that view, but people who have attended say that there was actually very little of that."

She needed the hell out of Kyle Reese, and the Terminator who showed up in T2. Even John her son had to set her straight a few times snapping his fingers in her face. Yea she was strong but she was also highly vulnerable and was suffering mental issues / PTSD at that point.
> black genius scientist
Yea they had a black guy in the movie who died trying to fix his mistake. Heaven forbid they put a black character in a movie. It's not that, it's the fact they replace white characters or they're DEI. One black guy in a movie who's in it for a fraction of the film is not DEI.

They always been marketing faggots to decisive consumers. paying ads in the Superbowl shilling their worse products, selling intel chips to normal fags in places like best buy by bribing them for sales.
they basically shilled their Nehalem 1st gen i7 and been coasting on it for years, 14nm+++++++++ fabs and small tweaks, meanwhile amd had worse single core better multicore product that failed,cause amd doesn't market like intel, so amd had to again change the hardware and you got ryzen. Intel shit so bad ryzen started eating them up. Their latest new arch is big core small core room heaters with 500w an d now those latest chips and last years chips are fucking dying in a year.

a) no it isn't there's also a lot of attacks on her past, be it the dicksuckery that got her where she is and the retard-tier positions she has supported
but more importantly
b) you have to understand the target audience. kamala's voters are brainwashed libtards. you're not gonna get to them by talking about kamala being extremely anti-gun, those fags think that's a good thing.

talking about how she's a DEI hire will reach all the males voting for her, especially the white males. not many of those in her camp, but still, some are. EVERY white male has seen DEI affect their career negatively. to a lesser extent, this will also reach asian/indian males, even some black males. all males lose to women when DEI is involved.

and talking about how she flipflopped on her fucking RACE will DEFINITELY reach black people. they're pretty militant about "cultural appropriation" and people trying to steal their own DEI points for personal gain, so yea, bet your ass this is costing her black votes. indian votes too, as its her indian identity she bailed on. and ofc, this will also cost votes from everywhere else too, as voters see her as dishonest.

I am here solely to point this out.

I have seen zero messaging from Republicans and their online proxies that is above board - they really think spewing veiled "but she's a nigger!" DEI lines is a GOOD strategy.

At this rate, I predict Trump to lose by a landslide with major R losses in the sunbelt and rustbelt battlegrounds.

At this point Texas will be in play for the dems by November.

Absolute buffons.

FYI I work in campaigns for 30 years and know very well what I speak on. I have campaign managed congressional campaigns and have held party positions for over 15 years.

When did I ever advocate for that? Once again you're making up complete bullshit to fit your narrative for what, the third time?

Right tool for the right job fuckwit, to pretend solar isn't a tool and there isn't a job it's suited for is pure fucking brainrot, look how much of Aus's complex systems already run entirely on the sun, we run entire fucking mine sites on solar, our farms run on solar, right there is the backbone of our nation running on solar, that doesn't mean we don't have gas, coal, nuclear etc, hell 1/3 of NZ is run on hydro and has been for half a century. Maybe instead of making everything so political you should use some common sense once in a while?

Oh right, you don't want that, you want people completely reliant on the system, right? The jew owned, DEI managed, system that has proven time and time again that it wants you dead and broke.

Is DEI actually intended to cause economic ruin at the business/corporate level?
Was this an engineered takeover to create some kind of pseudo-Soviet economic system where a single central organ owns all industry?
Do you see what I’m getting at?
Everyone keeps screaming “Get woke go broke!” But what if that’s the point? What if they want to make everyone and everything economic slaves to the central debt-dealing entity?

DEI diversity hires have ruined every aspect of everything. this includes being anything, a jannies, and glownigger, all women DEI hires do is drive white men out, cause bullshit drama, they cry on the job, and make the lives harder for the white men who stay. this is what the jews want to over see all this shit. to sew divide among white men. using white women as weapons.

Capitalism is completely dead in the West. The oligarchy used their printed money to buy everything of value and then pay off politicians to regulate any potential competitor out of the market.
Foreign competitors are waged war on at public expense for private profits.
That's the reason they can employ policies like DEI. They're the only game in town.

That's the way the entire Western world is currently being operated.
All mass migration is about keeping share prices and property prices artificially high. Without them being added to consume products, the entire stock market collapses and takes the system down along with it.
DEI is about keeping wages artificially low and an attempt to make it seem like these immigrants and women in the workplace are providing value to society.

It is totally unsustainable.

At that time it had migrated to tumblr, but it began and incubated on LJ and fandom forums like CBR. People think it originated on tumblr; they're wrong. tumblr before Yahoo bought it in 2013 was basically apolitical except for posts like "REBLOG if you think it's okay for gay people to exist!" kek. There are articles out there saying Occupy 2010 was organized on tumblr but they're full of shit, I actively looked for that content at the time and it didn't exist. Occupy happened on FB.
I'm at work but I bet if you did a google search for the word "tumblrina" you wouldn't get many hits from before the year 2012 or so, and if you did a search for "fangirl" you wouldn't get many hits from after 2013.

These people use race/cultural grievance i.e crime or diversity in media and race bait shit as a distracting while they raking in the profits and bring in more unruly rapists for their enrichment not yours.

And while that we blacks are dysfunctional dur to the 100 years currently due to Jim Crow and it's stealth systemic racism since "Civil Rights" which acknowledge was biggest mistake we both suffer with. We did not benefit from it nor DEI nor AA and your government purposely not only created minority status for Asians, Hispanics etc to make them siphon the gains and programs that was meant for Black American solely, but made sure to revision 50 year mass psyop fooling America that Hispanics and Asians were also badly treated same us in attempt to fool everyone that there was something inherently wrong with Black Americans are falling behind that systemic racism was lie.

Yeah, I expected something like that desu.
call me delusional, "winnist" opposite of defeatist, or something else, but im like 90% sure trump got this in the back.
Like what the fck is even that campaigning?
Kamala is a "brat"? What the fck lol?
Lady's like 60 or something, old enough to be a literal grandma.
Trump is weird?
Who the fck came up with this shit?
Is this the DEI caused competency crisis hitting her PR team like Boing?

It was a lab funded with public resources, yeah. I wouldn't say that the work we did there was irrelevant, quite the opposite actually.
But the ones who had the final say on everything saw it the other way around. To them, being able to report that we did a good job was uninteresting. They were way more keen on being able to report that we can now house some paraplegic vegetable in there without an issue, so that all their other DEI cultist friends would clap them on the back.
That's exactly why the Western world is going to shit. At the head of every other institution is some fucking retard who doesn't understand that the work performed in there is actually of importance, and thinks it's just some tool they can play around with to show off to their ideologically blinded dicksucker friends. We are being ruled by ivory-tower retards. Even if you removed everyone who is intentionally destroying society out of malice, you'd still end up with hundreds of thousands of retards embedded into the bureaucracy who will still ruin shit, not because they want to destroy the nation, but because they are fucking idiots.

Yeah, I had the same experience. I felt like some nazi fags were interviewing me.
But trust me, at the end of the day, no one gives a shit unless they're schizophrenically committed to DEI.

The Jesuit genetic labs at CERN are located in underground levels that the public has no awareness of. All the scientific and support staff in these labs are Jesuit fathers. The other roles not requiring scientific or administrative skills, such as food prep, laundry and cleaning, are done by mind-controlled individuals who are never allowed to leave CERN and are killed then replaced with new individuals about every half year. We consider this a necessary evil as the stress of being underground around the horrors of CERN degrades the quality of even such menial work over time, thus new workers are needed. Furthermore, that they never get to leave CERN alive means that our secrets are kept secure. These levels can only be accessed through special elevators hidden in the more public levels of CERN, and through special underground tunnels deep beneath the ground. The tunnels extend for many miles and have several openings above ground far away from the facility. The openings are located in small villages run by the Knights of Malta (KOM), an occult society with close ties to the Jesuits. These knights, who look like ordinary villagers, have guarded these secret tunnels entrances and exits for many years. They have been trained to guard this secret with their lives if necessary, for the KOM are dedicated to Vatican – and Jesuit- security. On the Italian side of the alps, there are other tunnel entrances that are guarded by other groups such as Opus Dei with equal diligence.

Trump schedules interview before 12pm, this blindsides the negros who were in charge of the event, so they had to start 30mins late. Kamala was invited but she had a funeral to attend. Trumps sits down and without a hello or anything, gets the spotlight put on him right off the bat. He gets pissy about it, until he is asked if Harris is a DEI hire. He could have used that question against her but fails, asking if she can define that for him. Trump immediately starts talking about Harris' ethnic background, saying he is confused about. Gets dragged out of stage by his team because the whole thing wasn't rigged in his favor.

Coding interview questions are retarded, they're designed to be obtuse and have very little to do with the process of creating software. They are puzzles that can only be solved when you already know how to solve them, which is why "cracking the coding interview" has so many editions.

I know a guy who coded a video game that made over $100k on steam, who then went on to interview for a dev position at a AAA company. He failed every coding interview question because he didn't know you needed to memorize the specific tricks beforehand. I looked up the woman who would've been his boss, and she was a black sorority girl DEI hire, who literally didn't play video games. Wtf.

If you understand how to follow a recipe, you know how to code 90% of things.
If you learn basic electrical engineering and how it relates to low level software, you can now code 100% of things.

Don't let tards demoralize you. Coding just takes practice.

It was DEI hire crap anyway. The height of American discussion culture being about shills and press gremlins spamming phrases like it's some kindergarden. By the party that has all the fat, colored hair on drugs marxist psychos who don't know their gender or what a woman is on top of it. You'd think they'd have a selling point for their candidate, but no, just the usual dirt throwing in politics. Newsflash: People just ignore such shit and drivel now. It's the reason why no one takes MSM serious anymore or as a source of information: No serious information present. So simple that they can't grasp that. They should lose their jobs for failing a core basics.

Kamala has every advantage
>polling is down but momentum is yuge in her favor in swing states
>normies hate vance
>media memory-hole'd assassination attempt, even though it was obviously a poor CIA nigger op
>media spinning everything Trump says as unhinged and dangerous
>Kamala btfo fundraising records
>media at this point are activist Democrats and will 247 run a propaganda campaign for Kamala while she hides away safely not saying anything stupid

However, Democrats have one problem: they are victim to their own DEI bullshit and are the "fail up" party (case in point: Kamala), and they legitimately suffer from the competency crisis. They are FUCKING RETARDED and their hubris is immense. If there is a way to fuck this up THEY WILL FIND IT.

everyone prefers asian women "over all", and all other women hate it.

even if some guys prefer to stick with their own i.e. Aryan Beauty shit ... at the end of the day the Asian girl is pretty enough and she actually acts like a female and is typically going to be less of a DEI enforcer nightmare.

The only kinds of white women who are no DEI / HR type nightmare whores are country / redneck whores who have a body count of 20 by the age of 15 and are ready to be "trad waifus" at 18 when their vaginas are so loose they're about to fall out and run away.

It absolutely will. He'll say he got rid of DEI and wave the flag and then send them to die.
