Unless the glowniggers really did DEI themselves into fumbling the entire operation and anons/twitter helped expose it all. With the level of censoring they have available, I cant see this being true. I think were all still in their plan and it has nothing to do with covid, or the financial system.

They usually do until the company wants to give one of their relatives a job or needs a makework job for DEI
Then they "offload" the project work (usually from the lead engineer) to the clueless retard that becomes the PM
The lead engineer still understands the project better than the PM and has to help them design the project tasks but the PM gets to make fancy graphs and Gantt chart to show leadership .
The other 95% of time is spent not being productive because how long does it take to input a fucking project into Asana and pressing button to make reports and charts.

You're a moron who's been psyoped by modern politics into thinking further centralization is the solution to changing human behavior when the only way human behavior changes is on an interpersonal level. You're advocating for the state to replace people's communities and culture, which is what we already have going on now, it's why DEI exists since it's both an ideology and a form of replacement that is state sponsored. We tied banning alcohol in the 30's and the only thing that ended up producing was violent and organized crime. If you want all aspects of culture and community to flow from the top down then you might as well move to China. Libertarianism shouldn't need to cover the cultural aspects of society if your culture is worthy of preservation.

Angers me too.
I knew guys who worked at a nukeplant in PA.
They were control room guys. The techs who ran the core.
They used to fagbrag with each other about how cool the remote location of the plant was. It had this great long rural/hilly road leading up to it for miles and miles.
They loved to fill their sinuses with blow then race each other on their way to their shifts. One guy had a white Corvette he was constantly talking about.
Loved Reagan.
Called themselves Republicans.

>>455606587
Thing is the above Danger Dog incels still were able to run the plant apparently without incident in those years.
Now we're expected to have DEI/AA hires. Literal retards.
I don't trust the perspectives of anyone who uses the meme term "competency crisis" however.
You're covering up for niggers, shitskins, and degenerates of all races. As though a population that regresses to a mean of 85 or lower can EVER be trusted around high technology.
"Competency crisis" is a slimy WEF-seeded meme designed to make people stop recognizing population biology and evolution, so fuck you.

a somewhat ironic twist is that people against licensing of new reactors end up causing old reactors to run far past their original licensing. yes, they are often retrofitted, but it's still one of those areas in which thank god a lot of shit in the 50s and 60s was over-engineered.

>As somebody who travels a lot for work I thank whatever Gods there are when I can hear over the plane intercom that the Captain is a white male.
Yea, I travel internationally a lot, but am at least primarily based out of asia, and they still care about competency, at least for now. an amusing thing is that skilled US pilots end up getting recruited to countries like china (both for military and commercial) because china realizes that competency is important, and will pay handsomely for it. they have no problem taking top cadets based on performance, whether from civilian flight schools or from military academies. had a few fun flights that were definitely ex-PLA flyers. sharp movements, and to the point. would trust them god forbid the worst happens over any la'quonda DEI hire from the bottom 2% of SAT scores at historically nigger colleges.

same reason white haired white guys make people feel safe. if they were able to safely land helicopters and planes while under fire in 'nam, they can at least fly a commercial jet to the best of their ability. covid and DEI have completely shredded that pipeline. the competency crisis is terrifying. ffs we still have tons of train crashes in the USA because we refuse to install cheap anti-crash sensors.

>I place nuclear energy as a backburner policy we can pick back up once whites have political autonomy again.
and this is why the demographic change has been a top priority for the elites, to reduce the number of Whites to such a low level that it will be impossible to regain control of the country. I'm very bearish on the US, and it doesn't make me to be bearish on the states (as I'm a White American, born and raised), but the US socio/economic/political system is fundamentally flawed imho and is irrecoverable.

Agreed. Used to be a big advocate of nuclear myself, but seeing as how complex systems are already beginning to fail from demographic decline, the last thing we need is an irradiated landscape because Shaniqua couldn't tell the difference between calcium and cadmium. We're already at the stage of barely being able to keep planes in the air due to DEI policies. Air traffic controllers are already incapable of routing flights when the computers fail. Add to that they are already starting to have all non-white flight crews and the airline industry is fucked. As somebody who travels a lot for work I thank whatever Gods there are when I can hear over the plane intercom that the Captain is a white male. Add these policies to nuclear infrastructure and everyone is truly screwed. I place nuclear energy as a backburner policy we can pick back up once whites have political autonomy again.

yup, I completely agree.
>why the US is imitating virtually the exact same reasons that led to the collapse of the Roman Empire. Surely there must be some behavioural aspect for the striking similarities.
I often wonder the same. it's a death cult in a way. to, in a pyrrhic fashion, rule over burned ashes. no sane or logical people would want this, as there is nothing to rule over. but, jewish leaders as well as many goy elites have a tendency to move from host to host destroying things and moving onto the next host. I don't understand it. if you want to be powerful, wouldn't you want to rule over a healthy, strong base? why do elites want cities to be hellholes? some democrat politician in SF had a brick thrown through her car window a few weeks ago, which was hilarious. why do they intentionally destroy the systems over which they preside? it's this weird, almost moloch worshipping thing.

and cheers, fun conversation. dont believe everything you read online. I love technology but uncle Ted is a swell guy, too. a lot of other engineers I know feel similarly. at the very least, I'm bullish at least on actual clean energy and nuclear development happening in china, because of how china controls their nuclear corporations and can finance them and employ "the best of the best" to man their facilities, without giving two shits about DEI or any of that other garbage.

as for the west.. ehhh. the frustrating part is that many people in the world (probably the vast majority) just want to do something productive with their lives along maslow's hierarchy, and things like energy and food form the base of the pyramid. which is why it is disheartening that food supplies are poisoned and we keep pushing for things like fracking and wind power which cause so much environmental damage, when instead we could just build some reactors and put competent people in charge of running them.

No. They failed because he valued fanaticism to the party over practicality and advice from generals. Literally the same thing the left does today with DEI and ESG, but instead of NSDAP ideals. Soviets did the same thing, they organized based on allegiance rather than competence or merit.
Yes, Hitler did believe he was possessed by a great spirit of some kind because he was an esoteric autist. Probably Wotan or some shit.

there's also the issue of financing in the US. the US doesnt operate on long term projects, capitalism doesn't allow for it. but in china, the nuclear industry is split between two SOEs (state owned enterprises), which get the most preferential loan rates from PBOC (people's bank of china).

so even if you do have a bunch of intelligent people in the US, and remove the morons and DEI from construction and operation, you still have the financing issue, and also all the regulatory tape etc.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t give a fuck about color, but if you have a majority of a populace in a state that does then the state gets the say, the federal government was NEVER supposed to tell a state what happened on states land.

There is no military, anon. The U.S. military consists of DEI sheboons and tranny generals who can't even operate their own planes let alone figure out how to use drones. There is NO MORE MILITARY. It's gone. In the case of a civil upheaval the establishment is incapable of doing anything as they have no power to enforce their mandates. They're really desperately clinging to this narrative of the military being the most powerful in the world because if people stop believing it then they can't enforce anything through fear.

If you’re worried about a draft, you’re worried about the wrong thing. The things that will actually affect you are much more mundane, like CBDC’s and the backdoor social credit system they enable, the DEI commissars who fire you first in a recession and hire you last, things like that. Not as exciting as war and drafts, but they’ll actually be what shapes your life outcomes, not an imaginary draft letter.

tbf DEI is a term that has been being used for fucking YEARS by ivory tower antiwhites and they dont seem to have any intention of letting up on it from what i can see. your average 20 something brown zoomer in college is as pro DEI as it gets, and almost every single club (and even a fair amount of sororities) have had DEI chairpeople for a while now. these niggas see nothing wrong with this to the point that they cannot fathom whites as anything other than this inexplicable old guard-esque force that exists solely to get in the way of them and more gibs in the form of diversity hires and laxxer immigration policies. its not so much that they hate you as much as it is that theyre perplexed that you wont just roll over and die so they can have even more shit and are mildly afraid of you when in areas that dont look like the fucking mos eisley cantina. it would almost be funny how retardedly self-centered their viewpoint on the issue was if it wasnt so corrosive.

People want quality in what they purchase. The worse the economy gets and the more people feel they need to stretch a dollar, the more they will expect that quality standard to be maintained so they still feel like they're getting value for their money. There are very few people out there who are willing to pay for a substandard product as long as it's produced by quota hires and contains the myopic opinions of some bloviating, pretentious faggot. That small fringe group has spent years amplifying its presence on the internet and social media, but the sales figures don't lie and people are realizing that it truly is a matter of going back to catering to customers instead of investors, or else their company will go tits up. Larry Fink with his $30 trillion + in capital doesn't care because no matter how hard these companies tank themselves to conform to DIE (I call it that instead of DEI, because when you implement those policies, people die) his losses will still be minimal because they can be written off as investment losses. Like the Rothschilds back in the days they were fomenting revolution throughout the world constantly, they win no matter what the outcome is. This is just a new, modern, digital form of that.

Even worse than that, I listen to a podcast called The Glenn Show (some nigger host). A month ago he had some faggot purple haired negress DEI person on who talked about how she got fired from a community college DEI team for not being progressive enough. The main thing I took away from the entire conversation was that a small community college had, I believe, 5 people whose entire job was DEI bullshit. Between salary and benefits, I imagine the taxpayer is paying around $1 million/year for a fucking community college's DEI program.

The thing where a company that is 98% White between the age of 25 and 55 tries to attract "diverse" work force at the cost of trying to coerce the present 98% White work force to praise "diversity".

In the general population people opposed to cultural marxism make between 25% and 45%, mostly in the demographic of 25 - 55 year old White men. So if a well qualified men has the choice between a DEI company and a non DEI company, he picks the non-DEI company.

So the company that bet on DEI lost access to the majority demographic in the work age and the best qualified, to get access to "divers" which makes out less than 0.5% of the general population

>how do you protest something going away?
Contemporary protesting is just cargo cult behavior. In the West and especially English speaking countries, we've been conditioned for decades to understand that waving signs and chanting slogans is an effective means of political expression, but not why. One of the things most frequently taught in college classes that satisfy the DEI credit requirement, is student activism in the 60's, and how crucial it was to everything [normies think is] good about society today. The idea is so ubiquitous that even kids cartoons like Spongebob and Ed Edd Eddy have episodes dealing with the ideas of workers rights and striking.

tl;dr: 99% of people participating in protests have no idea why they're doing it or how it will realistically solve their problem(s). They're just familiar with the idea of physical activity and don't know what else to do. At best they've got some sophistry about "solidarity" (another effectively meaningless Marxist buzzword) or "raising awareness".

It's already mainstream. Musk commented on it. The competency crisis is "including" retarded people of low merit or intelligence in fields they have no business being involved in. Imagine putting Shaniqua Tah-NayNay with her McNugget degree in charge of your nuclear power planet safety protocols, and you can see where this is going.

Some people DO NOT belong, and SHOULD NOT be there. Especially when it comes to critical infrastructure. DEI is pouring gallium all over an oil rig's support pillars then doing a big "WHOOPSIE!" when the ocean gets poisoned right after.

Same in my industry. Generally safe, but big push for DEI. Forced to allow sites to open in countries that we know are corrupt as. Now I am dealing with fraudulent data, doctors who can’t read lab results, and corruption with finances.
A huge portion of my budget was just given to the diversity department to produce a now legally required diversity plan. The guy who wrote it gave me a literal template with ctrl F replacement of some terms that are the project name in and charged us 250k of time and expenses to it. I could have done it in ten minutes. His ‘recommendations’ were medically dangerous and unethical. If I complain I’d be fired.
I genuinely don’t care what colour my pilot is, I only care that they’re as qualified as possible, and with as much experience and ability as possible. DEI is going to kill a lot of people.

FAA hiring targets: People with psychiatric problems and severe mental disabilities urged to apply
By Suzanne Downing -January 14, 2024

In order to meet its targets for Diversity Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility, (DEIA), the Federal Aviation Administration is recruiting for people with severe mental disabilities, psychiatric problems and physical disabilities.

The recruiting campaign comes at an awkward time, as companies like Spirit AeroSystems, which built the malfunctioning fuselage for Boeing 737 MAX 9s, have crowed to their shareholders about hitting their DEI targets for hiring, and firing white men in order to met their diversity quotas.

Targeted disabilities by the FAA are people with disabilities that the federal government, as a matter of policy, has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring,” the FAA’s website says.

The FAA’s targeted disabilities for hiring are, in the agency’s own words:

• Hearing (total deafness in both ears)
• Vision (Blind)
• Missing Extremities
• Partial Paralysis
• Complete Paralysis, Epilepsy
• Severe intellectual disability
• Psychiatric disability
• Dwarfism

“Individuals with targeted disabilities have the greatest difficulty obtaining employment. This is the only protected group for which Federal agencies may have a hiring goal,” the FAA says on its target web page.

According to the FAA, people with these disabilities can be hired “on the spot.”

Depends on the country, I guess.
I was in a similar situation as this anon: >>455486990 . I was so done with it all, that I just let it all out to my therapist (sick of being cucked by DEI, overworked for being the only white man and therefore the only one that works, discriminated against by the legal system, etc - basically a /pol/ thread). They told me that they want to avoid sectioning me (whether out of of compassion or budget restraints, I can't say), and asked me if I would an hero if they released me at that moment. I said I won't, so they didn't section me.

What did happen, though, is that now I get my old salary's worth in lifelong bennies for having "mental health illness".

I want to seethe at the fact that I'm the only sane person of everyone and somehow that's made them decide I'm crazy, but hey, I get paid to stay at home, work on my vegetable garden, increase my own knowledge, be a caregiver to my children so they don't have to be looked after some negress at a nursery, and all of this while sois and good goys have to carry on slaving away.

And you can too.

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk.

PwC has dropped some of its diversity targets in the US and opened up previously off-limits scholarships to white students after pressure from right-wing activists and a Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action. The Big Four accounting firm, which employs 46,000 people in the US, said it was applying “rigour” to its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to reflect the new legal backdrop.
The changes included ending race-based eligibility criteria for a student internship programme and for scholarships to help candidates prepare for professional accounting exams, two initiatives that were designed to increase the diversity of the firm’s employee base, according to executives and changes made to PwC’s website.
The firm’s latest annual DEI report, published over the Martin Luther King Jr holiday weekend in the US, also dropped a pledge to award 40 per cent of its procurement spending to minority-owned suppliers.
The firm amended some of the language in its report versus the previous year. It said it had an “aspiration” rather than a “goal” to reflect the racial make-up of the US university student population, which is 35 per cent Black and Hispanic. It also removed a guide to diversity metrics that labelled them as “on track” or “behind”.
The Supreme Court ruled last June against race-conscious university admissions, prompting legal analysts to warn that factoring a job applicant’s ethnicity into hiring decisions could also be considered unconstitutional. Companies including Pfizer and the law firm Morrison Foerster have also opened up diversity fellowships to students of all races.

I got a few options for Trump's VP:

Greg Abbott - Based R from Texas Effectively kicked out and removed subhumans attempting to cross American borders. Is practically good in R wing economy, not afraid of leftists including Joe Biden himself. He does R wing stuff himself without any instruction from the R Party, non-dependent. Not afraid of feds.

RFK - A new R on the area. Denies climate change ever existing, and is anti-leftist environmentalist. Potentially fascist R-leaning. Somehow a conspiracy theorist and not into globohomo vaxx mandates and COVID restrictions. Generally not in favor of federalism, and dislikes fedish COVID mandates and restrictions. Perhaps not into both Feds and CIA (cuz he is a conspiracy theorist, right?)


Ron DeSantis - Personally won and faced off against (((Michael Chitwood)))'s lefto-judeo ideology. Direct to the point in saying on why DEI, leftism, immigration, migration, illegal alienism is wrong. Does not fear The Left, Disney, Tiktok (ByteDance) and Leftist Communist China. Potential R-leaning fascist.

Not gonna be Trump's VP:

Nikki Haley. (Donald Trump officially said he will not like nor condone Nikki Haley's closet democrat globohomo and closet PRC standards. 100% sure Nikki Haley will not be in VP position cuz she is a literal faggot.)

Barry's administration actively worked to promote and retain senior officers who would push a political DEI agenda while forcing the resistant ones out. The left is fundamentally terrified of the military and the people who typically comprise it so they wanted to fundamentally weaken it in order to control it at the highest levels. The glowies and DoS dorks are all predominately leftist so this course of action was very favorable. The upper echelon mfs didn't care as long as they kept making money because the true purpose of America's military is not to win wars - its to prolong low intensity conflicts in order to prop up the economy. You don't need a particularly competent military to do this. The problem is that the left is both highly motivated to destroy America's institutions of strength and also fucking retarded when it comes to thinking about the long game. Like the copypasta says they know their diversity hires are disloyal cowards who are incapable of winning a war and most of the world wants America's lgbtqia+ boot off their necks after witnessing the horror shows in Ukraine and Gaza.

women now control sex, money and culture and its created ego hambeasts.

they always controlled sex, as far back as rape was illegal, but they didnt work, so they still had to sacrifice for food, and being a mother wasnt seen quite so much as the albatross that feminism-addled modern woman claim it to be. so men and women were forced to engage in quid pro quo.

then women were forced into the workforce, which picked up steam bigly under the guise of DEI. its been known for at least 100 years (everyone should read bernays's propaganda once a year until its internalized) that women are mindless consooomers and big time suckers, way worse than men, because theyre slaves to the herd.

so youve got women with money who can buy all the baubles they want and they dont need men thus there is no incentive to negotiate. this leads to rampant simpery, men giving it all up for a crumb of puss. you see these sad faggots all over in the passenger seat while their woman drives them around town. i feel like woman only find men out of some sense of "its what youre supposed to do" and also so they can spend his money, a lizard brain instinct women will never shake.

so they got the sex keys, at least half the money, and theyve steadily encroached on every male dominated zone in an effort to ruin it. i would guess over half the tv and movie content made today caters to women and weak men. so thats sex, money and culture they own. the kikes who handed them this opportunity love it: easily controllable retards, an endless sea of them, all ready to activate if you say the right words. the men who dont comply, call them a racist and take away their jobs until theyre homeless and dead in a ditch.

so yeah, thats the long and short of it. the only way to win is not to play.

The humiliation ritual is a classic expression of the east asian psyche, which manifests in all of their cultures. This feminine (high estrogen?) obsession with "face"/social standing leads to a society that thinks it's worse to be chided and taunted than to simply be beaten up.
it's this obsession with face that causes them to vote democrat in the west, even though diversity quotas/DEI are explicitly anti-asian.
I genuinely feel like Asians are under-hated. They're like jews without the creativity.

FAA hiring targets: People with psychiatric problems and severe mental disabilities urged to apply
By Suzanne Downing -January 14, 2024

In order to meet its targets for Diversity Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility, (DEIA), the Federal Aviation Administration is recruiting for people with severe mental disabilities, psychiatric problems and physical disabilities.

The recruiting campaign comes at an awkward time, as companies like Spirit AeroSystems, which built the malfunctioning fuselage for Boeing 737 MAX 9s, have crowed to their shareholders about hitting their DEI targets for hiring, and firing white men in order to met their diversity quotas.

Targeted disabilities by the FAA are people with disabilities that the federal government, as a matter of policy, has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring,” the FAA’s website says.

The FAA’s targeted disabilities for hiring are, in the agency’s own words:

• Hearing (total deafness in both ears)
• Vision (Blind)
• Missing Extremities
• Partial Paralysis
• Complete Paralysis, Epilepsy
• Severe intellectual disability
• Psychiatric disability
• Dwarfism

“Individuals with targeted disabilities have the greatest difficulty obtaining employment. This is the only protected group for which Federal agencies may have a hiring goal,” the FAA says on its target web page.

According to the FAA, people with these disabilities can be hired “on the spot.”

All he has to do is get a badass VP like Tulsi Gabbard. Ready to take the reins should anything happen. Trump is a symbol. He's a figurehead, the only way for the silenced and maligned anons on 4chan to have our voice heard at all. Without Trump we would sink into mass censorship woke-AI clown world DEI quicksand. The presidency is the only way to smash the lawfare and corruption of lawyers and judges who are at the core of the stolen 2020 election and every other entropic malaise afflicting our once great nation. We're not worried about Trump being a spring chicken for his second term, were worried about putting scum like Jack Smith where they belong

Our foreign policy and general attitude in the government doesn't make any sense until you understand that most foreign and non-western 'advisors' as well as consultants who are influencing CENTCOM, Pentagon, and various other organs of the Federal government are in fact puppeteers and manipulators.
Feigning friendship and possibly fooling themselves human abdin style but are corrupt and foreign to the core, trying to enact their group ethnic agendas in US as a hivemind with the intent of usurping its policies.
Council of Foreign Relations is just one example. Do you know how many middle eastern 'consultants' and faculty members are trying to influence our foreign policy and taking advantage of our nation while first feigning friendship, then progressively worsening to pushing DEI and making sure they are indispensible to the governing process?
Parasites, subversives, and liars.
Start going through all the universities around DC metro area and look through departments to see how foreign subversives are hiding in plain sight, taking advantage of our nation while claiming to be helping.

Los Angeles has always had some darkness to it. I was just thinking, Black Dahlia. Then later, the Manson Family. And whatever weird connection there was between Laurel Canyon and the military/CIA or whatever. But L.A. was definitely better at one time. And then everything took a dive during the Obama era. You'd probably need a few MAGA-type administrations back-to-back and stopping the money printer and spending (and thus, DEI crap) to get back some of what was lost.

I wish we could just nuke social media and smartphones in general, that would help.

The oppression olympics never end. The politicians will continually beat down the most successful groups to appease the niggers' envy. For the passed 100 years whites were wealthy and dominate, so niggercrats legalized openly discriminating against them. Asians didn't have to deal with this discrimination, so they rose to the top. But now the niggers realize that "Those Azians gots mo' money." Congratulations, asian bros: enjoy the decades long beat down. Enjoy getting taxed out the ass with a fraction of the government services available to you. Enjoy the propaganda telling your women that niggers make great lovers (it will be even worse for you than it was for us: your women are way more superficial and materialistic. they will flock to niggers the nanosecond the HollyJew comes for them.) Enjoy not being able to defend your home without having hard evidence that it was the most lock solid case of self defense evar ("Your honor, the nigger in that white man's house may have been armed with a knife and high on crack, but the video security system clearly shows he turned slightly towards the door for a fraction of a second before he was shot. Clearly, he was intending to flee. Therefore Mr. Johnson, who is white, is a white supremacist and guilty of 1st degree murder and a hate crime." --(((the lawyer))). "Thank you, Mr. Shecklestein. Your argumentation is excellent. I have weighed all the evidence. Mr. Chang is guilty of all charges and will serve maximum sentences on all of them." -- (((the judge))).) Enjoy DEI targeting you in every facet of society.

This shifting of the oppression olympics will continue until we hit Communism or everyone in the west is a nigger. And even then we would probably start measuring degrees of blackness and widths of noses to keep these Olympics going ala houto and tutsi style.

Oh, the sheer brilliance of an agent resorting to acronyms like "ppl" and "irl" in a feeble attempt to convey their oh-so-clever message. Bravo! It's truly a masterclass in linguistic laziness. I can only imagine the Herculean effort it took to type those extra letters. And to think, this is the pinnacle of their linguistic prowess.

Here's a thought for our intellectually-challenged friend: maybe if they invested a fraction of the brainpower expended on concocting acronyms into actual critical thinking, they wouldn't find themselves stumbling through the intellectual abyss. It's quite amusing to ponder how a pink-haired anime girl, with about ten times the brainpower of ten agents of this caliber, could effortlessly outshine their feeble attempts at linguistic sophistication.

As for their oh-so-clever strategy of spreading beliefs publicly, it's almost endearing how they believe anyone is buying their tired DEI tricks. Newsflash, dear agent: the era of naive compliance with your simplistic tactics is over. Nobody's falling for your little charade anymore. It's time to retire those worn-out acronyms and step into the realm of coherent thought. Or perhaps that's too tall an order for someone of your "irl" intellectual caliber. Better luck next time, champ.

Europe indeed (easily the most important factor in a post-globohomo world), but Africa has been kept just below boiling for decades as well; doesn't matter whether christian or not, it's the perfect counter-horde.

Then there's India, obviously, or call to mind the Rohinya and indeed China and Russia themselves after the lip service has outlived its value.

But perhaps most importantly: The entire muslim world itself has this simmering undercurrent caused by decades of failures.

This dhit ain't gonna be an Arab spring, but an Arab winter akin to the 30 years war.

Also it is foolish wishful thinkibg to attempt to separate migration and Islam; the movement ling since predates DEI/ESG and even the mass migrations themselves. It's deep-seated.

when you say "much of the world," who do you mean? european populists? russia and china are at least paying lip service to integrating their muslim populations at the moment (while also using them as an excuse to build up their domestic police state and surveillance tech)
The US isn't known for being pro-muslim, South America doesn't have muslims really, Africa has always been split along ethno-religious lines. So you must be talking about Europe because you're certainly not talking about the Middle East

i see the reaction in Europe as more of a reaction against immigration and corrupt politicians forcing the DEI/ESG agenda on their population as a trojan horse for control, and less against islam.

thanks for the rundown Persia-anon

Israel's statements yesterday about withdrawing from Gaza and allowing Gaza to self-govern could be seen as paving the way for a ceasefire. If a ceasefire happened, do you think the current tensions will defuse (with Houthis, Iran, Hezbollah, US/UK forces in Red Sea) or are we firmly on the escalation ladder to WW3?
"Nothing ever happens" but it seems like things are beginning to happen. Do you predict they will continue to happen?

Also it seems like the time is ripe for a zionist false flag. In your opinion now that Israel is backed into a corner, do you think they will lash out in this manner?

Finally, nukes. What are the odds they get used by either side in the coming months?

Look into the alleged bomb this boomer allegedly made. A highly sophisticated Thermobaric Explosive. Something only seen by non state actors a couple of times and those were sophisticated terror groups who had R&D teams of college graduates. Without advanced math and/or extensive testing as a proving ground you can't make a turn key thermobaric device. But this boomer makes one out of the blue and even wires it up with a loud ass audio warning system to clear out cops and civilians before it explodes.

Obviously the white guys at CIA were on duty because this job wasn't some sloppy DEI fuck up. They used the bomb to destroy servers housed on the Internet Backbone(Verizon?) and it knocked out the internet for 5 states. It's also theorized they used this internet blackout to infiltrate more networks and install more back doors. Likely hardware back doors on the backbone itself.

>>455377242
He gets it, when you look into the gritty details of the OP case and the Beirut case you see clearly who was behind each explosion.

>>455377483
100% true, the air/fuel mixture is a fine tuned variable that you can't just guess. Maybe with some advanced maths you can get close but someone with his education, a simple audio electronics installer, would need 5-25 test runs to get it right. Each of which would be a massive explosion. Even were I live innawoods we don't get many of those. Notice how the FBI never found the "proving grounds".....really makes you think huh?

Please note that Thermobaric explosions need a high explosive charge to kick off the chain reaction and sometimes several precisely timed....but I've already said to much.

No, I'd say niggers are just as stupid as abos but more athletic and violent. They are also extremely uppity and insecure, so they are easily manipulated by their jewish masters to attack white people, or whatever else the jews want them to do. I don't think abos have the same seething jealousy and insecurity complex, coupled with a lack of impulse control from a stunted prefrontal cortex. Nor are they protected from on high by their jewish masters. Niggers are just more destructive.

Ausbros, do abos congregate in your cities and get DEI'ed into corporate jobs they can't perform? Do they bus their kids into schools with your kids? Do they put up free housing for them in your suburbs? We are forced to mix with niggers here but it seems like your abos stay on their own reservations, no?

Like many religious cults, the members at the bottom are sincere believers that Opus Dei is the path for personal holiness. Many are “numeraries,” men and women vowed to celibacy who live in communal residences and hand over their earnings to the organization. This creates workers totally dedicated to their assigned tasks, assures a steady stream of revenue and makes it difficult for members to leave. “Supernumeraries” are married and live independently but are still required to make large contributions and send their children to Opus Dei schools if available. At all levels, the names of the lay members are secret unless self-disclosed. Opus Dei also has an order of publicly identified priests and prelates.

Opus Dei's only "charity" is founding schools, mostly business schools and student centers at the world’s leading universities to train and recruit a continuous supply of professionals dedicated to Opus Dei/Catholic goals. Opus Dei is “significantly connected to 479 universities and high schools,” according to journalist Michael Walsh based on a confidential report submitted to the Vatican in 1979.

https://web.archive.org/web/20220405041158/https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2014/4/6/1290024/-Opus-Dei-Influence-Rises-to-the-Top-in-the-Vatican

Opus Dei, an official institution of the Catholic Church, at the top is a secret society of international bankers, financiers, businessmen and their supporters. Their goal is the same as other plutocrats – unbridled power – except they use the influence of the Catholic Church and its worldwide network of institutions exempt from both taxes and financial reporting requirements to advance rightwing parties and governments.

A year after Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio’s elevation as head of the Church and his many appointments, the dust has settled. Three cardinals have emerged as the most powerful in this papacy; all have close ties to Opus Dei. Two now control all Vatican finance.

Still the most exhaustively researched book written about “The Work” as it is referred to by its members, Their Kingdom Come (1997, 2006) by Robert Hutchison, a Canadian financial journalist, traces the growth of Opus Dei financial power “by all available means” - deception, dirty tricks, even “physical muscle” like poisonings which mimic heart attacks. “What gives Opus Dei its importance is the influence it wields and also that it deploys its immense financial resources…Opus Dei knows very well that money rules the world,” Javier Sainz Moreno, professor of Law at Madrid University, told Hutchison. One of their goals was to control the Vatican’s wealth, now closer than ever to being realized.

man, it set up so many things. hard to list them all.

more than anything 911 constituted a jewish attack on the american people.

-while clintons telecom act of 96 was picking up steam and reducing our media to just 4-5 corpos, 911 and the war distracted us. as we now see, this was important for jews' biological leninism plans to roll in (lgbt, attack on US soil via immigrants, blm, DEI, etc).

- erosion of us citizen privacy protections, massive gains in federal reach & powers. patriot act etc.

- destroy US goyim physically via war, jews exempt as always. also weaken goyim back home in many ways both physical emotional and mental. get us all chasing red herrings like bin laden to set a stage for a nignog potus to play hero.

- massive money laundering opportunities. trillions "missing" day of 911. "lucky larry" fink's last minute insurance policy on the towers. war machine profiteering. and so on.

i could write 4x this much... 911 was an MVP play for jewish interests globally.

>I felt like it never ended
It didn't.
We had the Recession from '08 to about '12, which was hitting right after high school or college from most of us. A lot of us either didn't go to college, a lot of those that did dropped out, and a lot of those that graduated did so just in time to find a completely fucked job market that left us hopping from wageslave position to wageslave position.

Even when the markets finally started to recover and some of us started to get into some decent (well, less shitty) entry level positions, Boomers decided to put off retiring which led to a massive bottleneck in upward mobility. Boomers still have a lock on all the upper level positions, Gen X has been stuck in middle management limbo, and Millenials have been stuck in entry level with the only way to actually get competitive increases in pay being to make lateral moves every 2-3 years - which means you don't build any kind of seniority, which means Boomers and GenXers and their bullshit "you gotta put in your time" mindset instead of rewarding merit means that even now that Boomers have started retiring in earnest, none of those mid-level positions are going to open up until all the GenXers have gotten their promotions (another decade).

And, of course, all of this was happening in the midst of Covid and another Recession and runaway inflation and mass migration and a competency crisis and all the DEI shit and yadda yadda yadda.

The train that Boomers have been running on Millenials since 2000-or-so never stopped.

They are pissed that the Israelis' whore didn't do well. I think the message would reflect that what lessening white males there are in the country will attract to.
I want white males to go against the BS propaganda of "No Work; No Pussy" to explain DEI hiring practices because they are trying to shit on you while blaming you. It's not you!

They have 3 prices on everything, and will only sell at lower prices if you give them all of your dox and let them ransack you phone by installing their app.

Their CEO has bragged about the stores espionage capabilities

They let people walk around with animals in the food basket

Their nose a bunch of niggers that don't do their jobs

They push DEI and spew nonsense about some black history month

Their prices are all higher than they should be, significantly higher than Walmart
The stores usually have sewage leaks and will smell bad, saw one take over a decade before they repaired it

They pushed mask mandates but then claim they can be gun free zones because it's private property. Pick one, you don't have to obey the government and the disregard the government alfor the same reason

They are gun free zone

Jared Taylor dipping his toes in the water on the Jews. He's commented on them before but it's not his main focus.

>"The Jewish Question" - Jared Taylor
https://odysee.com/@ascbhakscjaksjak:6/jared-taylor-jews:1

Article from Taylor here :

>Jews, who have pushed diversity and anti-whiteness for decades, seem to think they get a special exemption as Holocaust survivors and perpetual victims. Thanks to current events and to Jewish wealth and prominence, Jews are not just white oppressors, they are uber oppressors.
>The question, therefore, is: Will Jews learn anything? Will they insist that the solution is Holocaust awareness training, starting in kindergarten? Will they demand that DEI offices add them to the victim’s list so they can be coddled and made to “feel safe,” along with blacks and trannies?
>This Jewish law professor makes the stupidest possible argument in the bluntest possible way: “To Fight Antisemitism on Campus We Must Restrict Speech.”
>“The value of free speech has been elevated to a near-sacred level on university campuses,” writes Claire O. Finkelstein.
>Another ignoramus or liar. “Antisemitism — and other forms of hate — cannot be fought on university campuses without restricting poisonous speech that targets Jews and other minorities.”
>Please, she says, hate white gentiles all you like, but leave our precious Jews and other minorities alone.

[...]

>Jews are smart, but they can be appalling blind. They have been busy promoting mass immigration, diversity, multi-this, and multi-that. Bill Ackman has finally realized that Jews can’t escape being white.
>They need to decide which side they are on before they get chewed up by the multi-culti madness they helped set in motion.

It's Not Antisemitism. It's White-Hating.
Jews need to decide who’s side they’re on.

To put it in terms that normies will understand:

Americans aren't going to want to live in walkable cities with public transit if you're going to decriminalize vandalism, public defecation, drug dealing, littering, theft, and assault. They aren't going to want your urban planning if you defund the police and let violent criminals right back onto the street after being booked and processed. They aren't going to want to live in your city if their kids can be removed from schools (that they pay for with insane property taxes) on a whim to house illegal migrants. They aren't going to want to use your high speed rail if the conductor of the train is a DEI hire that flunked all their training.

In short, niggers and white leftists are why we can't have nice things.

You're way over thinking this anon ... DEI is aimed at big ass corporations and successful company's that hiring a black woman tranny for one position will just eventually lead them to one where they will be left out of the important jobs.

My company is fairly large, but the top workers are definitely not hired on for DEI purposes all those hires work mundane monkey jobs. The best workers we have are bull headed, anti social just do it types.
I'm not sure what the office is like, but its pretty diverse there, then again, computers do most of their jobs and the top level workers are either men, or women who are good in those fields like HR, or accounting.

Real politics:
A. Big solar can be owned by huge private farmland holders like Bill Gates who want's to also shut down farmland. Boomers are selling and that's step one.

B. Reactors always meltdown during a power downs. Less reactors in a country are better as all are soft targets for EMP and everything related. It's accepted science we will have mega-flares in our lifetimes that will fry the power grid, reactors will have to power down and they will have backup cooling failures. There is also likely a solar micro-nova event coming based on the behavior of the three closest stars to us in the direction of the galactic center, boom boom boom, Sol is next in line with a calculable year 2046ish. Also everyone knows EMP attack on the US is more likely then a nuclear war.

Any of those would shut down the reactors, many will have meltdowns not because of an EMP but because people are fuckups. A grid down event will have a 90% kill rate due to starvation. And reactors power downs almost always fuck up, so more reactors = chernobyl's all over the fucking place. Look at Japan's Fukushima, yeah are you going to tell me the Japs don't have their shit more together then the DEI hires in the US? Nope, we're fucked.

But side note, LENR is likely to take over the reactor/heating industry. Despite MIT doing hit pieces against Cold Fusion decades ago, Cold Fusion aka LENR is becoming competitive. LENR reactors can fit in a car, don't produce neutron radiation, just X-rays and UV. Yeah, that's the future. FYI.

And Bill Gates if he somehow lives another hundred years drinking children's blood, he's going to build up a solar empire replacing farmland, then sell that shit to suckers. Same goes for all solar, all solar investment is going to be sold to suckers.

I don't like trump and I'm not american so I'm pretty unviased on this. From an outsider perspective you're just going after him politically and denying reality, it was a riot, big deal. By going after trump and trying to stop him from running/locking him up when he hasn't committed any crime you're actually making yourselves look bad.
Its blatant that you're trying to steal the next election even if the last one wasn't stolen. You're making Trump look like a paragon of democracy and yourselves look like DEI fascists.

It's just a jewish blackmail scheme that works on 2 levels.
Larry Fink, of BlackRock, openly said they used ESG to coerce companies, and they have all the tools to do that, since most companies either need money or have already sold stock to BlackRock, Vanguard, etc.
The mid level grift is by forcing them to get approval from DEI (((experts))) who threaten to ruin the company's reputation if they don't pay their premium speaking fees and participate in the bullshit. Ofc, one affects the other, so as soon as you need credit to grow, you're fucked.

Lui era il principale antropologo accademico di tutta la Germania, detestava la "razza baltica-orientale" (fenotipo degli slavi e dei baltici). Hitler ha detto che i terroni sono stati degradati razzialmente in MK.

I have a theory on DEI. In summary: it's a long-term cost-reduction strategy.
It's obvious that unqualified people cannot perform jobs as well as qualified people. Like, it's painfully obvious, so obvious that there's absolutely no chance that corporate leaders aren't aware of this fact.
Most DEI stuff comes from publicly-traded companies, meaning Blackrock/Vanguard/State Street are driving it. Let's also assume all corporate leaders (the C-levels, the lower ones don't matter much here) understand that DEI decreases worker qualification in their company. The largest expense for a company is worker wages. Filling your company with incompetent people provides the perfect excuse for automation efforts. Since automation has a better ROI (particularly in large corporations), other shareholders will go for it.

>"Obviously we have to change this."

When United crashes a plane because they hire a retarded nigger to fly or maintain it, can we just nonstop rub this in everyone's face? DEI is going to kill hundreds of people and they don't even care. We're screaming with as much speech as we're allowed to have to not do it.

People need to understand, we barely manage to have no crashes as it is, it's a very hard standard to maintain and their plan is to remove merit, to judge based on skin color. It often means not going with the 2nd or 3rd best candidate, but the 600th best. Hundreds of times, thousands of times. This cannot work out for the better. 0% no accidents cannot get better. We maxed it out and finally made flying reliably safe. And now they are jeopardizing that.

Also, they receive federal funding, which you're not supposed to be allowed to get if you discriminate, and to hire blacks you have to discriminate against more qualified people. As the left loves to remind us, blacks are too stupid as a whole, too illiterate, to even get a voter ID which is why Voter ID's are racist. If they they are so mentally incapable that they cannot get Voter ID's, then I don't want them flying me anywhere or maintaining planes. Merit based hiring also lets you rest assured when you do see a nigger flying a plane or fixing one, that they can probably actually do the job.

DEI was originally just DI and is already getting more letters (LGBTQifying) into DEIB (diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging) and perhaps other terms
But yes, it is stupid to fixate on the invented terms from lefties rather than specific policies, and often I assume part of the purpose of these ideas is to cause confusion and demoralization because some feel like they’re being attacked on so many fronts
Personally, I just lump all commie bullshit together and don’t care to ‘understand’ it or the threat it represents beyond acknowledging it as commie bullshit.

The very name DEI reads like some kind of bad ironic fiction:

>As part of the DIE initiative, the FAA assistant director, Manny Crashlandh, said that planes will be prioritized for landing based on the intersectional minority status of the pilots. Research by Drs. May Day and Ngo Suhrvyvers found that such a policy will increase equity dramatically in the airline business. But some critics, like Ida Wanadye of the Worried Passenger Union, says she is worried.

It has to be intentional. They are laughing at us.

Extreme.

We don’t have nearly enough ships
We don’t have enough sailors to crew the few ships we have
The ships we have are ancient and take a LOT more maintenance than previously because they are fucking old.
Our new ships are clusterfucks of epic proportions: LCS, Ford, Zumwalt
Our navy now has captains and senior officers who all rose through the ranks under Obama’s DEI/loyalty Uber alles promotion scheme.
Hell we don’t even let the sailors paint their ships anymore (which leads to a LOT more corrosion than necessary and even MORE maintenance time.
Most navy ships are composed of a handful of competing drug gangs and drug use is EXTREMELY common.

Our military is fucked FAR beyond what you think. The 1980s us military would wipe our current force out in a matter of hours.

But you’ll also buy a plan ticket the next time you need to go somewhere. It’s about a humiliation ritual where you stuff your little dick between your legs and squeeze like a good little goyim and keep your mouth shut. The less sense it makes and the more ridiculous it is, the greater the resulting humiliation for people like you who just shuffle on shaking your head in silence and buying tickets anyway.

Yeah I know what you're referring to, but I don't think they expected so many whites to also start rioting and were worried the blacks and whites were getting too cozy, so they decided to start using DEI and ESG to alienate them from each other. DEI is basically the koshernat compromise for blacks, you get something out of the deal with jews and fuck over a third party (with blacks/DEI it's whites, with whites/koshernats it's muslims). This is the same sort of D&C trick employed at OWS when everyone starts getting mad at the (((wrong people))).

>Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk plans to take on multicultural America’s most sacred idol: Martin Luther King Jr. The idea naturally inspired a wave of media condemnation of Kirk ahead of the MLK holiday. It’s rare for any public figure to criticize King. Kirk himself praised MLK as a “hero” in years past.

>But the TPUSA chief is now “redpilled” on the civil rights activist and his legacy. This is a very positive development. It’s essential that more conservatives critique MLK. The diversity, equity, and inclusion framework is imposed on America in large part due to King’s efforts and our nation’s worship of him. From the civil rights regime to reparations, MLK stands for America’s anti-white mania.

At this point I fully believe normalfaggots will bring back lynching and kill the 2nd illegal Constitution(civil rights act) and there will be threads here form "le basated hitlerites" saying if you want to repeal the CRA you're a double secret double jew.

I think it was a product of the Social Justice wave more than anything else. Once it welled up and merged into our institutions with its adherents being given more and more DEI power, it's became anathema to put blame onto the institutionally blameless.

So fat people are coddled instead of being shamed, and society is forced to go along with it. 'Fat shaming' dovetailing third wave feminism was the final nail in the coffin. Because fat women at the end of the day feel as entitled to it all as their thinner counterparts.

Companies like blackrock have forced companies to adapt these idiotic policies in order to access the market. No DEI? Your company gets blacklisted and since they have all the money you don’t get much say. It is being forced, undeniably. The fact someone has to explain this too you like a toddler indicates you’re legitimately too stupid to function.

The entire problem starts and ends at the C-suite level. This is entirely a management issue. The only significant parts outside company management are the political (and regulatory) interactions with Washington.

It has nothing to do with factory employees or engineers. The two major problems with the plane have been a software problem and now a mechanical fixture problem. The only connection to those two domains is through the C-suite.

weaken Warren Court era Establishment Clause jurisprudence and return christianity back into schools & government. pump as much tax money into churches as possible. Red states should start passing covenant marriage laws that raise the bar for filing divorce, and eliminate no-fault divorce contracts as an option at all. Eliminate community property laws and make prenuptial agreements a mandatory part of the marriage contract where the presumption (unless explicitly opted out of) is that all assets pre-marriage shall remain with the pre-marriage owner. Jail pornographers and block its distribution. Use lawfare against federal or state laws that benefit women like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Attack and eliminate state & federal DEI/affirmative action initiatives which disproportionately benefit women. There's a lot that is doable, but conservatives need to grow some balls and do it

For the vast majority of women, their PRIMARY value is as a wife, homemaker and mother.

Media, feminism, government and big tech have gaslighted women into thinking they're something they're not. Most young men are all too aware that society considers them disposable, and their only value is what they can bring to the table, while simultaneously robbing them of any opportunities, via DEI, affirmative action, mass importation (H1B) of cheap labor, and blowing huge financial bubbles that only boomers and the .001% really benefit from.

We're due for an enormous economic correction. Women will face a very harsh reality check.

For years people could sit in do nothing tech jobs because management had no clue about what they did. They just needed an analyst or security person. They aren't even qualified to hire those types of people.
That and the big houses went all in on DEI. Pretty much anyone they hired after 2008 or so is 100% expendable. The bigger problem is that the people that built these systems are all retiring and their replacements have no clue. We are one mistake away from major infrastructure outages. The quality of people in tech is undeniably lower. I know women hired as product VP's straight out of college that don't even have a basic understanding of the product they represent.

This. It's rare that you can break a war down into one single cause. It's a grade school way of looking at history for multiple choice exams. College exams, in a time before DEI when they meant something, would ask you to write an essay an the causes (plural) of the war.

The war was brought about by slavery, but also unsettled issues of state powers vs federal powers, economic conflict between North and South, religious conflicts, and foreign powers seeking to break up the United States for its refusal to participate in central banking. For conspiracy theorists, that last one, being a hugely prosperous nation without a Rothchild bank controlling it all from the shadows, was the single most important cause.

Look at our current war in Ukraine... what is the cause? You could detail a hundred incidents that led to US/Russian relations turning to shit since the 90's. It's the build up of many things.

The preferable scenario is obviously the man making more than a woman. It causes tension in the relationship no matter how either person thinks they feel about it.

Realistically though, with all this DEI shit, this is going to happen or a lot of peoiple are going to die alone. Try to think of the positive aspects, like having more money for the family unit.

We want more white people so some will have to be with wealthier women than them.

Pope John Paul II issued some quite extensive apologies during his pontificate. Whether or not it included the Albigensians (which includes the Cathars, Paulicians and Bogomils - even if only loosely, and also the Waldensians. We saw him making a very pointed outreach to the Waldensians in Rome. So perhaps they have apologized to the handful of followers that survived those genocides.

One of my personal heros is Giordano Bruno, the Dominican burnt at the stake in Rome’s Piazza Farnese (or Campo dei Fiori) in 1600 - so I sympathize with your call. Perhaps Innocent III and the popes of his era saw these “heretics” more as a civil war within “Christendom,” and that he/they had to put down at all costs. Looked at from that perspective, we can see why they would never have apologized, any more than US presidents would apologize for the Civil War today.

What the Albigensians/Cathars represented was a protest against a world in which all civic and religious power were merged, even when the civic rulers were at odds with the church. They simply lacked the means to stand up to such a concerted effort to bring them down. Apology or not, it needs remembering.

The last world war had homogenized countries involved. Which means that the people at home didn't have to worry about police presence. If WW3 were to break out today, could you imagine the strain on major cities when people realize that the police force is full of retarded DEI hires? It'd be hilariously easy to get rid of "undesirables" during times of great strife. Fucking imagine the deaths at Walmart alone if sugar/butter/gas stamps became a thing again.

Like what? I stand for viewing politics as a set of problems to which we should apply solutions. To properly come up with a solution you have to consider actions regardless of the political leaning.
It's telling that CEOs of corporations don't look for jobs with some kind of party affiliation. Like "It's time for a republican CEO to deregulate the company and promote job growth." You don't see that, because the practical solutions focus is the default method in business in general. Even today with how woke capital has gotten, you have them doing a DEI initiative one hand and then seeking to evade taxes and destroy or take control of competitors on the other. Or a movie company will release a woke movie about owning supremacy while making an action movie filled with allusions to individualist heroism and traditional gender roles at the same time. It's all just a practicality to achieve profits, while for politicians it would ideally be practicality to achieve prosperity and happiness for the country.
Only in politics is the partisan bullshit tolerated because it's how you get elected, further your career, and propagandize the masses, to the detriment of the country.

One of the reasons these farces are tolerated by management is that it provides some veneer of legal protection against discrimination lawsuits they might face, so having someone drop redpills in what is essentially an anti-racist morality play defeats the entire purpose

they don't train to push the start button, but most of their work is automated, because the skies are way too complex to leave the lives of over 200 passengers up to some 2 faggots in the cockpit.

If you look up the incident with Qantas Flight 72 (QF72) for example, when an onboard computer miscalculated the autopilot nearly killed everyone on board. Certainly, the incident was investigated thoroughly and future similar events were eliminated, but it just shows how much control computers have over passenger planes.
So if you think a DEI is going to crash a passenger plane - yes, if the computer systems fail, but that would be a freak event by definition

It’s just all about the cheap labor, the fact that DEI is allowing unqualified people into highly technical jobs and expecting the professions to teach them the trade is incredibly reckless. The analysts don’t know what they’re doing beyond cherry picking their variables to increase profit and the brain dead management only care about their own pockets. This is the deathknell of western society and it’s all thanks to capitalism, I hope you enjoy your judeo-hyper capitalistic dystopia where you own nothing, tater man

Dot Bomb of '00-01 was the best thing that happened to me.
But you're right about the malarkey later--when proto DEI took the place of even the candy-ass skills of the early Web.

Every fucking kid from some jerkwater university came in advertising themselves as a Designer or Programmer, then getting excited over the temporary fat paychecks for basically being a VC sponge for whoever was running their company. The narcissistic self promotion was more low tech than today but somehow more insufferable.)

This isn't news, he talks about this openly. It is how he made his money.

Yes, he is a former pharma exec. It was his experience in pharma that led him down the rabbit hole of the WEF/ESG/DEI Vanguard and Blackrock financial manipulation schemes and their connections to power first hand.

>Soros
Tired talking point that has been addressed in literally every thread.

It was a generic grades based scholarship from PAUL soros, not george. There were no strings attached. He wrote multiple books and and is actively against the open society foundation and the DEI/ESG blackrock and Vanguard initiatives. He started an competing finacing company to take them on directly. He is financing himself from his profits in the Pharma industry and isn't wasting it on TV ads.

As for the kikes, he has directly stated multiple times that he would end special treatment for israel and encourage them to defend themselves while the US uses its materials and military to secure the border and deport the 'migrant' invasion. He is the only candidate to declare ending the primary agencies which mossad controls, namely the FBI (directly trained by ADL operatives) the ATF and the department of education. These are not empty promises that can be countered by the Israel first congress as he has identified and articulated the legal presidential powers that are currently active from 1977 which allow unilateral abolition and restructuring of redundant or inefficient agencies.

Every single policy proposal he puts out is a direct attack on the known mossad control networks and his action plans for achieving those policies is based on legal precedent that goes around the mossad control systems which neutered Trump.

He has laid out the detailed plan to remove mossad networks and re-establish nationalist control of the west and claims that if he found anyone he thought would be more effective to implement that plan he would gladly give up his position. The support he has isn't for his personality, it is for the plan he has articulated. The very plan that people HOPED that Trump was following. Trump forgot that he simply rode an America First wave and believes that he leads and directs that wave. The wave existed before him and he failed to live up to it.

>It’s funny because pajeets ruined Boeing not blacks.
Actually true with the antistall that was a major loss for boeing had to ground their entire fleet. So the harping on african american airline pilots and staff is a bit misleading. But it's caused by DEI and hiring an incompetent african coder who you knew could fuck something up cause he's poorly trained, would have same result. That's just because it was in that particular case a programming error. But it could happen in any level of construction or design or anything, because if you have a principle i can hire dumb people of other races who can't even do the job, for positions where you can't make mistakes like this. Then this is what is going to happen.

Anyways have a nice evening/night.

Well there is one difference, the bigger the operation is, the more it is required that those who maintain and operate it, know exactly what they are doing.
Making DEI even worse because they are hiring them in big countries in very big industries, where if something goes wrong it goes wrong in a big way rather than in a small way cause it's all scaled up.
This just makes DEI hiring when you aren't even sorting for competence, even more disastrous.
For example in terms of IT If you have servers that serve 1000 clients, and it fails and also backup fails. Or if you have it maintain only 10 clients. This is a much bigger issue with much more significant consequences.
So if that indian coder that fucked up the boeing fleet and caused grounding of the entire boeing fleet some years back. Had instead fucked up some database access to a website temporarily, than the antistall mechanism of an entire fleet of airplanes. Well that'd be fine, database is down now just need to go find where he fucked up.
That's where you can do this DEI stuff, not with big airplanes or big infrastructure things or big industry.
You can only do this sort of hiring when if you fuck up it's not too big of a deal. So you are factoring that in.

Also in terms of scale is something americans don't seem to grasp. Because even if denmark is a tiny country and so is netherlands. It all works same way. Scaled up or scaled down doesn't make any different except it's more moving parts. However you're doing the exact same things anyways. So in this way size doesn't really even matter. Unless it's way too small to even function. Which no country big enough to call itself one is to begin with.

The crisis elon is trying to point out is, USA went from some of the most sophisticated infrastructure and building some of the most complicated machines, to now ending up hiring dumbasses to both build and operate them, causing errors that shouldn't exist with complex machinery. It's directly caused by hiring incompetent people, and the competent people they go do something else, cause of USA refuses to hire them cause of this DEI bullshit.

There's jobs for dumbasses where they can fail and it's no big deal. And there's jobs or functions where there's basically zero tolerance for being a dumbass, cause you can't 'afford it' in terms of you need attention to detail, or you get people killed.

Also to me aside from DEI being just blatant anti european racism, and race based hiring with race based quotas. Which leads to actually in a minority/majority situation which is most nations. The main race of that country gets shafted and can't get hired for that position cause of the quota is exceeded faster.

And that's bad enough but they have extended it so now they are also hiring incompetent people of these other races, knowing full well they are incompetent, for jobs that you absolutely should not be allowed to be even remotely incompetent for.

You should only hire slightly incompetent people for positions where if they fuck up it's no big deal. And you are hiring or creating specific 'no big deal if you mess up a little bit' positions, to help people enter job market or whatever else.

To misuse that. That's what the danger is, you can't hire these people for positions where if they fuck up they get people killed or hurt. And that's exactly what part of DEI is being used for.

FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT ELON MUSK WENT FROM A HERO LOVED BY AMERICAN LIBERALS TO AN EVIL MAN, because he came out and said he didn't hate europeans and wasn't necessarily for endless invasion immigration.
Till then they loved the ground he walked on. So what changed? nothing. He's still being elon musk but they didn't like him being vocal on that part, so now they are trying to destroy tesla motors, his recently purchased x former known as twitter, and anything else.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1745475145337020463
Here's musks actual position. https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/01/complex-systems-wont-survive-the-competence-crisis/
Which is completely correct.
With complex systems and building things where life are at risk if it's not done right, and where error tolerance is therefore low. Idiot participation trophy bullshit like DEI has no fucking place. Unless you want to get people killed in the process. Is why elon mockingly has started calling DEI, DIE.

Also it's not about africans or anyone else necessarily being stupid. It's that if they happen to be stupid, they shouldn't be part of building or operating things that can get people killed if those individuals happen to be so.
DEI advocates disagree, is what the issue is.

The irony is, if musk had never gone political about being against anti european racism in USA and internationally, 100% of the american liberals would have agreed with him.
>yes obviously we don't want stupid people to build and operate airplanes, that's dangers, good point elon
And you already know that this is what they would say. But now he is persona non grata, nothing he ever says is correct, even if it is, simply because it's him saying it. So preposterous.
If you took a random hobo in USA and had him say same thing. They'd probably agree, but elon can't say it because elon is suddently 'a nazi' and is now 'wrong about everything'.
Welcome to american politics these days i guess.

Now admittedly elon might be sharing slightly incorrect tweets, but he's correct about the competency crisis including in USA aviation and other complex systems where DEI is being utilized to simply hire non europeans. Not even caring that those people are not qualified for the position, but simply cause of their race being non european. Even if they were competent it would be wrong to do because you are then refusing to hire europeans simply because they are europeans, and preferring actually another race instead. But it's even worse in usa with DEI, they don't even care that the ones they actually hire are competent enough for the position.
Boing had recent crashes some years ago because they had outsourced antistall mechanism to an indian coder who fucked it up. Also the pilots had not been adequately trained in the aircrafts so they hadn't read the manual and didn't know the features or how to disable the antistall that caused several crashes and deaths of hundreds of people and caused boeing to ground their entire boeing 737 max 8 fleet some years back.
And now there has recently been a problem where the frigging door flew off.

This is the direct effect of DEI.

And then the 'officer' title, as if she has state sanctioned authority. It's a real underhanded way to try and project power for such a make work role.

you have a right to peacefully assemble and redress grievances. You have no specific right to form a grouping. Go try and form a white student union or any sort of non mainstream political grouping on a college campus. Go try and incorporate a non-profit (New York has been particularly aggressive about this). You have a right to assemble which is why a church grouping can worship, but then again during the pandemic they showed how weak that ability is because they started to directly attack freedom to assemble. You have far less rights today than you did 30 years ago and in the future it is only going to get worse.

They wanted to twist it into some sort of right to join the military and get a DEI job. They have writing from the 60's and 70's that shows that was what their end goal was. They did not expect the court system to take the turn that it has.

There is only so much payroll to go around, and if you do it fairly, it contradicts the DEI mandates and laws. This is why:

1. My wages are suppressed. I am in both wage compression and wage inversion.
2. I can't get a promotion in a reasonable time frame.

Simply put, I am not a protected entity in my own fucking country. And if I make more than a roastie, then the laws are written to mean that is breaking the law. Basically everyone is a minority unless you're a white man.

Im an HR Manager and in my experience there isn’t this deep hatred for the white men. Corporate mandates reports regularly to ensure we meet DEI goals. Sometimes there is pressure to get a diversity hire for certain roles and whites may be overlooked. It’s just about making numbers and appeasing our Jewish corporate masters.

In my experience the best HR managers that are female are mothers that are married with children. If your HR manager is not married or has children she’s going to be a cut throat bitch with something to prove.

All in all HR doesn’t give a fuck about you. They care about making it look like they do.

At some point you'll realize DEI is just a codeword for a religious-like inquisition and purge of white people. Always ask any ardent DEI proponent
>Why is diversity only ever an issue when there is a white majority involved?
DEI and its supporters view white people as a problem that needs to be "fixed". The worst of them are white liberals who are fully enamored and absorbed by it. When I was younger I used to wonder why some blacks hated Uncle Tom types. Now I can see something similar: whites who hate themselves in an effort to be liked more by their non-white peers. The entire western English-speaking world has allowed this masochistic ideological disease to permeate everywhere, and white people are afraid to speak out against it in fear of being stigmatized or thought of as a non-good white.

If you want to know something hilarious it's that Jews are included in DEI for acceptance into Harvard and Yale, but once they are in they are being counted as white for the statistics to mask the incredible bias.

For example Harvard has ~34.6% white students at undergrad level, including 9.8% Jewish students. The latest US census indicates that 75,5% of the US is white including 2,4% Jewish people. Put this altogether it means that white people are underrepresented at 33.9% of expected value while Jewish students are overrepresented at 408.3% of what would be expected by population alone. Ergo, a Jewish applicant is 12 times more likely to be accepted than a white student to Harvard.

These are the skills they advertise, that boomers claim are needed by their hiring or management staff at these restuarants (before they hypocritically pretend no skills exist and you dont deserve their pay).

>the dishonesty is what gets me
Its offensive dishonesty, like when businesses pay for headlines complaining "no on wants to work" during recessions after mass layoffs, or to gut an industry (like farming) before replacing domestic labor with cheaper illegals. The whole "unskilled" lie is the same logic, to create a "certification culture" where experts with 20 years experience can be retired before time if they dont stay on the recert treadmill, dictated by HR departments (the lowest skilled but highest paid job in the world) with the less skilled (DEI hires, etc). The same logic governs "treatments not cures" in medicine, and so on. We lives in a pyramid scheme society of legal fraud. If you really want to fight the matrix, start building an organized crime network, its the only thing that can stand against the legalized cartels.

He was groomed to be Trump without the baggage.

1st step... take some yes man military faggot with baggage out of Congress and get him into higher political office. Run him against an easy win (black crackhead homo found naked in a hotel room right before the election). Even then he barely won.

Step 2. Give him political wins. RNC with the R supermajority legislature in Fl tees up lots of easy agenda wins for him. Hype all those wins on Murdochs Fox non fucking stop.

Step 3. Give him an enemy and a platform. Those motherfucking wokesters at Disney gotta go! Corpos happily play ball since they dont want Trump at all costs. Remember how
DeSantis "took Blackrock to the woodshed over DEI"? So Meatball tilts that windmill. Anti-woke becomes his platform. Endlessly push the bullshit "victories" on Fox news.

Step 4. Make him look like a big winner. Run him against fucking Charlie Christ (former R gov suddenly turned Dem...) whom everyone there fucking hated with a passion. Christ runs an absolute shit campaign losing intentionally. RNC/DNC rig the elections in key states same time to ensure Trump backed candidates lose so the "red wave" never happens and RNC can start talking about how Trump candidates cant win. Trump LeLoser. Greasy wop magically "wins by 20". Endless media hype on Fox about "America's favorite governor, a real WINNER".

All the while, Little D hangs on Trumps coat tails like a little bitch. NEVER says a bad word about Trump directly. Calls himself antiwoke MAGA governor in FL. News yaps up non stop how he's Trump without the baggage. And look what happens a few months after winning his 2nd term as Guv, he run against Trump.

He was a planned Op since 2016. A fucking uniparty Operative set up and media promoted to try and peel of Trump voters. Either to win outright, or strip enough delegates away from him to stop Trumps nomination.

Outside of the butthurt belt, it's not size or even economics that is the limiting factor, but rather incredibly poor planning, poor maintenance, DEI, and the competency crisis.
This isn't little guy vs big guy, it's Russia vs incompetency.

Seatbelt laws, smoking bans, helmet laws, social security implementation, affirmative action, DEI, central banking, free trade agreements, feminist programs.

It starts off with international organizations like the U.N and E.U creating policy initiatives and then soon after the woke federal politicians start implementing them in lockstep.

These international organizations set the standards in academia, and then academia is who fills the cabinets of elected politicians and the administrative State.

So even if you have boomer politicians, woke regulators who work for the FDA will start regulating stuff out of existence on behalf of the U.N

It's not likely to reach that point, those planes are several millions of USD each. The casualty and fatality count will be like having a deadly pileup many times over every time it happens though.

Personally, I love DEI. DEI will be remembered for permanently damaging the reputation of many demographic groups, and rightfully so. I've also realized that my job, no matter the career field, is to fix the mistakes of the foolish and incompetent. So long as the choice is made to, I will never go hungry, nor will I ever go poor.

Take a car if travel is possible terrestrially. It's faster. Between driving to the airport, processing through, waiting for the increasingly frequent flight delays, flying, processing out, and reaching final destination, it's easier to rocket down the interstate overnight for any distance under 3200 miles, if you're ever so inclined to do a straight push.

The Pentagon and the entire Military Industrial Complex appears to be rotten to its core and run by violently stupid people with undiagnosed childhood or work related mental illnesses. I have no other way of explaining this phenomenon at this point.

I also heard that a Major got KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT by some PFC in 29 Palms recently so I can only imagine how stupid some of the career officers really are. The entire military has a huge defect of white recruits because it's run by corrupt and incompetent racist fucktards who only got in because of nepotism or DEI and it's not going to get better anytime soon.

Honestly the electric tank thing and electric military vehicles in general sounds like the LCS on steroids. Any reasonable adult from most backgrounds would be able to tell you having such SENSITIVE SYSTEMS IN EXPLOSIVE SITUATIONS is a terrible idea but yet that does not stop anyone...

Jews are in a tricky place here. The new DEI standards do not categorize them as separate from white people, so it discriminates against them the same as whites. Instead of coming to the conclusion that DEI is bad and should be scraped, their hatred of white people kicks in. They wish to be separate from whites so they can be represented in the DEI standards and support discrimination against white people at the same time.

Things didn't work out as planned, I switched degrees and schools. Don't get me wrong I knew what I was signing up for, and likely wouldn't be working in the industry had I not. Certainly many of my friends who got a 'lower value' education didn't land the same positions. Not that any of the education actually mattered, only the paper is needed to gain access to the system. But the system is breaking down, inflation is too high and wages too stagnant. The entire premise was that you can pay it off with a higher ssalary, but cost of living has destroyed that. Without the loans people from middle class families (lower class gets scholarships) are effectively barred from technical industries, all while immigrants and women get free passes.

At this point I hate them so much having seen the DEI hires that got their shit paid for, the people they've gotten killed, I'm ready to nationalize all higher education. Fuck the ivy league. Fuck the endowments. Fuck the financial aid, fuck the loans, they've destroyed our capabilities as a nation and neutered our professional class. They are parasites and a threat. Threats to the Volk must be removed.

I honestly don't know why more people don't talk about the entry-level problem when it comes to the work crisis they're blasting everywhere. Like I'm not even talking McWagie fast food or retail, but actual entry-level for actual jobs and shit. It's just untenable to break into any industry now. I don't know how else to put it other than the fact that companies are making it impossible for actual legal workers fresh out of college or a few years out to actually get any entry-level job without insane amounts of hoop-jumping and just outright lying.

Companies are literally barring out the young up-and-coming generations from starting their career life, simply shifting all the available jobs and workloads to already-existing 'senior' employees who managed to get in before this new change in attitude, or to migrants/foreign workers.

THIS is the issue for so many. Surely I can't be the only one observing this. ENTRY LEVEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ENTRANCE, NOT A BARRIER. Blackpilled as everyone in the younger generation is about working, there is still a plethora of people who still are willing to work, even at the insultingly low wage offerings, but they just simply cannot get in without being either insanely lucky, or otherwise connected. Blue-collar and white-collar both.

Seriously, why aren't more people talking about the days of honest laboring, either physical or mental, and simply being hired to start, are long gone? So many willing to work, like myself, but just actively barred out, whether because of DEI, or overqualification, or stupid HR bimbo underqualified standards, or H1B, or whatever the fuck have you.

>Making bitcoin legal tender
He hasn't. The only thing he has done is allowing people to sign job contracts in any kind of currency. That's not what legal tender means. This being said bitcoin adoption like El Salvador has done really doesn't make the jews mad or whatever.
>Eliminating 50% of the government including all the jewish DEI bullshit
What he has done is actually RAISING taxes on the middle class and workers , fucking over pensioners, making everyone mad and poor, cutting import barriers so Argentine industry disappears to benefit Chinese imports and told people to expect 24 MONTHS of stagflation, raised rent prices, increased unemployment in the private sector, etc. As a bonus he has confirmed the purchase of 20 F16 planes from the US. LOL
What's the result of all the argentine suffering? According to Milei 2/3 of the benefits of his policies will be seen in 15 years. In 35-45 years according to Milei Argentina can expect growth and prosperity compared too.. *drums roll* Ireland!
Pensioners especially have seen everything double in price while their pensions are stuck in the mud. Milei promised to make the 'castas' pay for the liberal adjustment but people are realizing they are the ones who will pay for it.
The funny thing is that the most die hard libertarian Milei fans are mad at him for being this retarded and actually dooming the country to a perpetual leftist government in the future

Yes, all of society is like this now. Affirmative Action which turned into DEI basically means you have to begin with the premise that even the highest of institutions does not have the best people.

The west has recreated the old soviet system, except it's dumber and gayer.

Go to a hospital? Can't trust you'll get good care.

Send your kid to a school? No good education, plus he must beware of groomer boomer teachers.

Want to go to a public space? It's likely flooded with foreigners who resent you for existing in your own country.

All of this was done on purpose.

My boomer parents never taught me shit. My mother harped on when I was a teen, that, “you should do something you love, otherwise you’ll be miserable” and other boomer drivel. My parents never emphasized education and the importance of choosing a career by 19 or 20. Even though both of them are college educated, and obviously understood it.

Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian parents emphasize and pummel the importance of education and career into them when their kids are like 2 years old, and beat them if they get bad grades or slip up.

I’m a White millennial that grew up in California. If my boomer parents actually cared about me, I could’ve gotten a tech career in Silicon Valley 15 years ago, and earned enough money to retire by now. Who knows, I’d probably be a crypto multimillionaire or billionaire as well. I knew of bitcoin back in 2011, 2012, but simply didn’t have the money to invest and go all in. Now, that’ll literally never happen with my age, the economy and DEI hiring policies, lmao.

It’s irrefutable. They inflated the global economy, printed a bunch of money, lied about being genocided, and bankrupted and looted every place that took them in after having the native populations killed. Jews are not “good with money” they’re just good at stealing it, assuming identities, shapeshifting and killing and erasing their hosts. The muh Christians banned usury theory is for 50 IQ unread morons.

The services of the Temple Church made the pilgrimage to the Holy Land a lot safer. Now pilgrims did not have to carry as much money with them when they set out on their journey, reducing the odds of attracting robbers. Plus, if they were robbed, they would be able to replenish their finances at their destination.

In an article for the BBC, Financial Times columnist Tim Harford called the Temple Church “the Western Union of the crusades.” Historians often refer to the organization as the world’s very first bank, preceding Italy’s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena by several centuries. The Temple’s concept of a letter of credit was not entirely original; in the 7th century CE, Chinese merchants could deposit their coin rings at agencies in exchange for promissory notes. The key difference was that these agencies were operated by the government of the Shang dynasty, while the Temple Church was a privately owned enterprise.

In some cases, they would charge rent or a holding fee – which was not forbidden – instead of charging interest.

The financial services of the Knights Templar were not just available to Christian pilgrims, but the general public as well. Ferris mentions that “all classes of persons who possessed treasure” turned to the Temple Church to store their gold, silver, and jewels during the 13th century. The order’s list of clients also included the English nobility, who stored taxes and feudal dues.

I have a great idea.

We should take up a collection and rent a house next door to one of these "DEI CEOs" that publicly promote this anti-white DEI racist bullshit. Like literally the house next door. I'm assuming it's going to cost something like $20k a month or more to rent because all these CEO cocksuckers are bloody rich and live in ultra-lilly-white neighborhoods.

We then find and move in the BLACKEST, MOST FUCKING GHETTO black family we can find into this house we rented and offer them free rent with NO strings attached. Like Shaniqua and Tyrone on fucking steroids. They MUST have kids because we want their ghetto black kids to want to play with the CEO's lily-white kids. You know EXACTLY how that's going to go.

We only ask that the ghetto black family allow us to install a camera on the outside of the house and in the backyard so we can watch the pissed off Boeing CEO talk shit while Tyrone and Shaniqua are blasting rap music at 3am while partying in the backyard while Jamal and his boys are flirting with the CEO's 18 year old blond hair, blue eyed daughter.

How much you want to bet after one weekend of Tryone and the boys blasting rap music, smoking blunts, and just being their natural selves—We can catch the Boeing CEO on our backyard camera muttering the words: "FUCKING NIGGERS!!!!!!"

Hypocrites, the entire fucking lot of them.

It's one aspect of it, yes. BLM, Antifa, holohoax narratives, and "leftism" in general, are all other parts of it as well. The new "religion" they are creating doesn't have a name yet. It probably won't for a while. Christians didn't really start calling themselves "Christians" until the second century. Before the called themselves Christians, they just called themselves Jews.

Probably yes, DEI is built off of a Christkike framework, just more focused on the social justice angle. It's a software update for the Goyim, same with the new traditionalist Catholics, and the evangelicals. The kikeservatives are to serve, as analogs to their Hasidism, slave breeding programs, and particularly to serve their breeders (the Hasids and other Orthodox Jews) while the DEI crew is to serve the Jewish elite classes, and to help prevent us from discovering FTL travel.

Yes, but there is something called "shit detail job."

If you make waves, they can't fire you. But they will definitely find a way to make your life a living hell. At that point, your best bet is to start psychotically demoralizing your coworkers. "If I'm going down, so is everyone else around me."

Or quit and find a new job and leave your old supervisor and the purple-haired 300lb leftist dyke in HR a horrible (but 100% honest) review on Glassdoor etc. That will hurt them the most.

Also, you can use the jews subversion against them. What's stopping you from claiming you're a jew—despite you not getting "officially" converted into their religion? After all, if men can suddenly decide they're women—and the kike DEI shit forces you to agree with that—what's stopping you from identifying as a jew?

"Oy vey Mrs. 300lb Dyke in HR. I feel this DEI stuff is anti-semitic. If you don't do x, y, and z to make me feel less scared while working at your company, I'm going to call my cousin at Shlomo, Shlomo, and Shlomo firm and will have a nice payday once they find you have violated my jewish rights. I will take a $5,000,000 check in advance.

Just say that you started your own jew sect—because you felt that sacrificing children in blood libel ceremonies was morally wrong and that's why you couldn't go to jew school to convert. Basically, play their fucking anti-American, anti-white, commie games against them.

That's literally all false. This is at least the 100th thread of Milei supposedly doing something American libertarians want done in this country, that's completely irrelevant to Argentina.
>>454622334
>>ended the jewish central bank
Again, he didn't. But regardless, the Argentinian national bank isn't Jewish, it's nationally owned by Argentinians. Unlike the Federal Reserve, which he wants to tether his nation's economy to.
>>made bitcoin legal tender to end jewish monopoly on currency
Completely false.

>>eliminated 50% of the government including all the jewish DEI bullshit
He's eliminated 5,000 government jobs out of 3.5 million and nobody is more Jewish than him in Argentinian national politics. Keep coping though, kike-lover.

that dumb nigger reposts one of the most poignant arguments against artificial race baced gap closing (affirmative action, DEI etc.) and then acts like it's irrelevant because most white people aren't 140+ IQ even though the same principle applies at all levels of IQ, just not as dramatically
even at 100 IQ whites will be heavily overrepresented in comparison to blacks in comparison to the population, just not by a factor of 250 as in the 140+ bracket
that factor of 250 is also proof that black nations will never be capable of great scientific or technical innovation on a large scale, and refutes the argument that black nations are shitholes because of muh racism. it's because of low black intelligence which is due to genetics

Encourage individuals to choose their roles based on their skills, passions, and capabilities, rather than conforming to rigid societal expectations tied to gender norms. The goal is to create a space where everyone, regardless of gender, can explore and contribute to various aspects of life and work based on their unique strengths and interests.

Inclusivity should be at the forefront of these efforts. Strive to create environments that not only permit but actively encourage individuals to pursue careers, hobbies, and roles without being confined by traditional gender stereotypes. This involves dismantling preconceived notions about what is deemed 'appropriate' for a particular gender and instead celebrating the diversity of skills and talents that each individual brings to the table.

Additionally, it's important to provide education and awareness programs that challenge existing stereotypes and promote a broader understanding of individual potential beyond gender. This can help mitigate resistance to change and foster a culture where people are supportive of each other's choices, irrespective of societal expectations.

Be mindful of criticisms related to the misuse of diversity initiatives for political agendas. Study ancient societies, for the positive aspects of their social structures. Strive to apply these lessons, recognizing that historical wisdom should be adapted to address contemporary challenges, such as concerns raised about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) bureaucracies.

The impact on future generations is a critical consideration when examining the potential trajectories of current social disparities and trends, especially regarding gender dynamics. Here's an elaborate exploration of the potential consequences:

People always explain it like this, but the logic is plainly nonsense.

You absolutely can say something "as hurtful" to whites or asians or whoever.

The difference is that those other groups don't have a never ending perpetual victim complex and we don't justify severe retaliation over nothing but mean words.

Basically other groups are just typically more rational and have learned to take that sort of thing in stride.

The only reason blacks continue to overreact like spoiled children when people say the evil no-no word to them is because we as a broad society allow them to and nobody criticizes them for such an absurd overreaction. Nobody tells them to get over it and everyone gives them attention and sympathy when they flip out due to "muh history" (where the vast majority of them weren't even alive and have actually benefited tremendously from built in systemic sympathy, DEI, affirmative action).

It's just dumb as fuck. Nigger is a just a mean word, same as spic or chink or whatever else. It's genuinely no big deal. Furthermore it can be appropriate to call someone a slur if they are behaving as such as per the OG Chris Rock standup where he was and still is correct that there are normal black people and then there are niggers. Same for other groups and their slurs, etc etc.

Not to mention DEI and how it's impacting society.
Separately, I've seen a lot of people come to realize that black a advocacy groups are not fighting to be recognized by the content of the character. This has been exasperated because of how bad the democrats are with crime.
This alone has primed people for racial conscious rhetoric to a great exent.
I'm not about worshiping race, but it's clear whites have to circle the wagon because we are at a dangerous point in society if we largely hold on to our 20th century ideals.

All these issues make people realize that the majority of other races do not see America in a color blind fashion. And for our own safety nor should we.

In order to defend the Individual and Liberty, we need precise modern definitions for them. Not a re-imagining of the classical ideas mind you, but an update. There hasn't been any updates since John Stuart Mill's 1859's "On Liberty."

Defeating the jews will take every resource and every faculty we have. Where it needs to start though, is the local levels. Local NGOs, town councils, city councils, county boards, etc. After that we move up the chain. We banish all marxists (DEI, woke, trans, etc etc) and build bulwark to identify and prevent their re-infiltration (which they will always attempt).

We then need to return to an updated form of Classical Education to build robust independent future generations with strong character.

The worst enemy a marxist has is a rugged individualist capable of free and critical thought.

Just so my fellow anons know, a bag of red cells with a few phenotypes on the red cell can get sold to a hospital for 2,000 USD+. I was once happy to do it even with a profit margin that no one is ever justly compensated for because it's the decent thing to do. But after how they treated us to try and force that shit into us, I'd sooner pour it down the drain before I ever donate again.

It’s one thing to be led through a day in the life of a dirty job for the kind of money he pulled in with fame to boot. It’s another to be the typical person actually doing those jobs to get by.

And Fox is retarded too. Not as bad as CNN slop and such but man it’s gotten dumb. Basically just props up corporations and shits on young people without actually addressing real problems.

And hey, lots of white straight young men want to work, they just don’t want to be impoverished serfs with jobs that make them want to blow their brains out. If that’s too much to ask then this society deserves to fail. Also nobody is hiring us because of DEI retarded initiatives and affirmative action which should’ve long ago been illegal.

I think a good tactic is to defend diversity hires in cases like this with an argument such as "ok yes, DEI may come at the cost of professional competency, but I think it's worth it despite what the alt-right says". Lead them on so they either admit (or don't deny) what's going on.

Jews have had a free hand at running the country since the 60s and they smashed it into the ground. For the last 40 years, our foreign policy directives have been run by dual-citizen Zionist jews who live in Israel, foreigners who had total access to the DoD, State Department, and White House. We went $28 trillion into debt in 20 years fighting wars for jews. They also shilled for mass-immigration and every scrap of anti-White rhetoric swirling through the country today, including DEI and ESG.

Yes, jews are the bigger threat. By far.

It could be about a perceived down turn but its just as likely if not more that less people are simply needed as they make technological improvements which are on the horizon if not ready to go right now.

Blockchain, oracles, smartcontracts, and AI in tandem ends up displacing many more white collar workers in the near term before it does the blue collar workers.

No, the crews obviously reported the issue. The airline did nothing and the NTSB did nothing, save make a minor limitation that the aircraft couldn't fly over water.

The real story, along the general lines of American societal decay is why the warning light was ignored and the issue not gotten to the bottom of? Why was the only consequence a minor limitation not to fly over water? I saw an NTSB conference on this incident helmed by a black man and a white woman and it did not inspire confidence in the system.

The holohoax needs to be the final redpill because it's the aspect of Jewish power that boomers are most hysterical about. I've prodded my boomers with soft redpills such as jews being top donors to both parties and jews running the asset mgmt firms that enforce DEI/ESG and they'll even reflexively ask if I believe in the holohoax out of nowhere in the middle of my explanation and even try to dissuade me by saying "I'm sure a lot of people who know these things deny the holocaust. That should concern you".
You have no idea how retarded they really are. They see believing in the holocaust as a virtue in of itself. Telling them Bolshevik jews killed 40 million whites in Russia and Ukraine is just another factoid to them like the height of the pyramids or something. It's truly bizarre.

It is unironically over for Jews. The left are hating them for Gaza, Bill Ackman and his hypocrisy around academia with his wife, Blacks are hating on them for Harvard dramas with the Black president, extreme right hating on them for open borders and their anti white tirade with DEI. So much noise and varying opinions on social media it’s getting difficult to control the narrative, but ultimately throughout all the winding narrative chaos, all roads inevitably leads back to Jews.

Whenever I look back at history at the many, many times Jews have been targeted for their trickery and heinous nature, I always wondered, if they’re at the top, and control all the media and narrative, how did it all crumble. Well, now we get to see it unfolding in real-time. The cycle births anew. All it took was Musk to open free speech on X, and like any oscillating cycle given we were so far from the mean the force required to keep us there was significant, we just needed 1 straw to break the camels back and begin the reversion.

Naturally Jews will be aware of this and see the tide shifting, they will begin the propaganda to redirect likely to China, DEI or Blacks, this will end with a new war, once again retard whites will die in the millions and we’ll begin the new phase of Jew growth again, ad infinitum.

Its woke/DEI, another name for Marxists. It's how they take over every facet of a society.

1. Demand access to group/profession/organization by playing victim
2. Demand representation in that group: any resistance is proof of their victimization
3. Once established, eliminate all opposition and completely overtake that group/profession/organization and replace with your own
4. Use the power/resources of that group to further the overall marxist takeover until said group/organization is destroyed
5. Move on to the next group/profession/organization

It has nothing to do with legitimate claims of underrepresentation or marginalization. It's only a strategy to infiltrate and take over society at large one organization at a time.

it is true and very funny how things are playing out with DEI. You have 30-40 yo roasties lording over white engineers their same age, telling them to write every thing into procedures, but they can't write them themselves. So they send white engineers like me to go talk to the few remaining old techs who has all the knowledge in their head. The old guys laugh at the whole effort, and here I am trying to get their knowledge both the old way (bullshitting with them, showing them what I know and don't know and letting them help fill int he blanks) and the new way (have to write up fuckign documentation all day, have to make it so roasties will feel safe SOMEONE will be able to still do the job (knowing it won't be them). So in 5 years after all the old guys are completely gone, roastie is going to tell me to hire Jamal with his diversity engineering degree and train him on "that one procedure -we- generated" and I will and Jamal gonna have a bad day, and when Jamal has a bad day, everybody has a bad day. And then Roastie will blame me, for not being able to teach him, or not writing the info down good enough. And guess what, I end up getting stuck doing it while Jamal sexting white whores on snapchat. And when they see I need real help, only then, will they give me an assistant of my choice, 5 years too late, while Jamal is appointed a custom job title and position to "move past" his incompetence and actualize his full monkey potential.

It's true. It's about to get really bad for DEI and the managers doing it. I'm currently wage inverted (newer people who report to me make more than me) and myself and many others are current wage compressed (new people who report to me or less ranked than others who report to me are making as much as I was 5 years ago as the manager).

When you try to find out why you realize 2 things:
- All the money that would have kept our wages salary has been siphoned into DEI positions (direct or indirect, it used to be only indirect i.e. token, but now they have DEI specialists) and DEI agendas (we spend more on progressive PR events than we do on fixing our engineering stuff like we're talking in this thread)
- It is LEGAL to pay white men less, but it is ILLEGAL to pay anyone else less because of what it means to be a protected minority - so it just traps men like me in this wage inversion and wage compression

>so why did they stobbit?
I'll try to get right to the point, although there is a lot more I could say. Each individual industry is unique, but the money men and corporate management structure are the same across every industry. The same trends that stifle innovation in aerospace and power generation stifle innovation in video games.

The video game industry has seen a transformation from the 80's and 90's when they were created by small groups of 10 people really in to making them, to the modern day when a video game is a 200 million dollar project with thousands of people, subject to the same controls as any project of that scale. In order to get the money men to approve of something like that, you need to show them tons of marketing data that demonstrates projects like yours have been successful in the past and a market exists for your product... in other words that it's a copy of another successful game. This approach works fine if you are looking to launch a chain of burrito restaurants or zinc mines... demonstrate that there are people who want that type of product and what they are willing to spend on it, then try to carve out your price if the market. This approach is the absolute death of creativity and innovation though... just rip somebody else off.

On top of that you have the corporate culture that thus thing is a paycheck, not a passion. You have a management team that doesn't play video games hiring DEI people that don't really give a fuck about this project and are just going through the motions to get money to fund their real passion for furry porn.

Maybe the jobs stats are fake. There's wide suspicion of that but I admit I don't have the data on ghost job openings nor the demographics of jobs filled in a recent time span.
I'm interested in the US, Canada and EU countries by industry and sector against economic zone. I'll have to spend months trawling databases.

It's also possible it's misconstrued or embellished. Most job openings created this quarter but they're all part times (38 hr schedules) without benefits paying federal minimum, and the better paying full times are going to below market visas on DEI, or something.

>It's funny because our boss is a very rich white man. White females always have a way of getting hired. I got my orders from my white female manager though.

Yeah unfortunately this is often the case. I definitely see what you're saying here - it's easy to be racist and lash out at other races in these situations - but there are many cases where it's our own people who are to blame.

The problem is that the DEI ideologues are getting more radical as their ideologies fail, not less. Same as Mao, Stalin, etc. they never step back and re-think.

I prefer to work on showing my own people why they are wrong, rather than insulting other races of people. It's disgusting that there are people like this who hurt their own.

I don't know much about the arts industry. But it doesn't surprise me, you never see a white male in an ad now.

I definitely think race relations would be more harmonious if we didn't have insane libtards running everything in the country. They seem to *want* to destroy everything. Obviously (other) whites are on the bottom in their insane worldview but they're far from benevolent and don't seem to care about POC other than pawns in their game, hurting them long term too by enforcing bad cultural values. Alot of POCs don't agree with it either but don't know where else to look for ideas. And the kids are fully brainwashed

Interesting. What company do you work at? If you can't tell me that, can you say the approximate size, industry, etc?

Were you banned from hiring all whites or just white males? Was it due to DEI reasons, or expense reasons (ie. POC being cheaper)? Were the owners, execs and HR white or POC?

I'm just curious what kind of companies are refusing to hire whites. I work at a medium sized company and we've hired a bunch of young, fairly talented white guys in the past few years. Seems like there's an availability of white employees out there, maybe in part due to discrimination by the larger corporations.

I think the root cause of this issue is a lack of a free market in dating (and by extension all levels of society). Politicians only care about aggregate birth rate to prop benefits, tax revenue and solvency. A robust supply of worker bees replacing each other at a rate above two is good for the economy since it forces growth.

I think we've spent 15 years implementing top down patches that have stunted dating and mating. The spaces that exist for most men and women, dating apps, are algorithmically rigged to charge them or rig DEI. The reality is that people want to date who they want to so if we keep rigging it we just alienate people more. It's not sustainable, just let the cum flow freely and reform the divorce courts.

That's not really how it works
Meritocracy means the top 20% of workers are the top 20% of americans
DEI means the top 20% of workers are the top 20% of Blacks, top 20% of Whites, etc.
But, as the Black average is much lower than that of everyone else, adding their top 20% to the highest positions in our economy is still a downgrade

Good evening anons
Ukrainian anon reporting in
It's Orthodox Christmas today :3 So Merry Christmas, frens :3

What has happened in my country today?
The (((official))) media are telling us that:
- Many Goyim continue to celebrate Christmas today. So antisemitic and rude
- The war in the US greatest ally continues. Day 93
- The statue in the center of Hamburg will be dismantled in favor of a “reflection space on sexual and gender diversity”. So stunning and brave, Goymoney
- Netanyahu seethes over Hezbollah
- 13-old kid from US beat Tetris
- Elon Musk has used illegal drugs (The WSJ)
- THE KIKE'S MINION LUTSENKO CLAIMS THAT UKRAINE LOOSES 30k SOLDIERS (DEAD OR WOUNDED) EACH MONTH. He urges goyim to get drafted
- The kike's goons allegedly snatched a goy in Bila Tserkva and beat him to death. They deny it and claim that it's just fake news
- iPhone 16 to get bigger screen
- Orban can soon rule in the EU council (Politico) EU seethes
- The minister of foreign affairs of Japan arrived to Kiev
- Boeing 737 MAX 9 lost a door in the air. DEI is our strength!
- AFU intercepted 21 out of 28 Iranian drones last night
- The black overlord of Pentagon spent 4 days in hospital
- THE KIKE'S GOONS SNATCHED A GOY IN THE ZAKARPATIE REGION IN FRONT OF HIS WIFE AND A KID. The wife released a video complaining about it. But then, just a (((coincidence))) goy, she released another one apologizing for her complains. Everybody thinks that the kike's goons forced her to do it
- THE JEW DEMANDS THE WEST TO SEND HIM (I mean Ukraine) 300 BILLION USD OF RUSSIAN FROZEN FUNDS. TRANSFER THEM NOW!

You mean wavy?
Or jet stream "wobble"?
The jet stream wobbles all the time; that's what gives us our "Nor'easters" here in New England (we're in the midst of one as I type).
>it's very simple
It isn't though; there are many complex systems at work here which are all working in unison to create weather. It is not as simple as that.

unusual cold patterns on one side of map ≠ earth is in a warming trend

>the information is all available
Forgive me for my skepticism, but these are many of the same people who were double-masking during the pandemic;
the same people who also said it couldn't be manmade;
the same people who vote for Biden;
the same people who want more DEI;
the same people who encourage open borders;
the same people who tell you driving an EV—that's charged by a coal-fired power plant—is better than driving a tiny internal combustion-powered car.

It isn't simple, and I'm not burying my head in the sand. In the late 1970's, all of the world's climatologists and meteorologists were talking about the potential for another ice age because they saw a cooling trend.
They said many of the same things they're saying today, except in reverse.
TIME magazine published an issue about the Earth going into an ice age in (I think) 1973.
There was also a special on public television about a coming ice age, hosted by Leonard Nimoy:

Partly this, partly DEI. We went to the moon by grabbing the smartest rocket scientist ever out of the clutches of the Nazis (though he was actually Nazi but history likes to rewrite things as if he and the hundreds of other Nazi scientists we grabbed were just "pretend" Nazis). Now we have a bunch of DEI hires trying to to get us back there with the goal of cheaper launches, but it'll still be the most expensive rocket ever made and cost more per launch than anything before it. Our only hope is Elon getting us back there, and he's already 3/4 of the program to actually land people on the moon.

Yeah this is the unfortunate reality in our over specialised economy. Innovative business require educated employees and if education itself is gatekept based on DEI then you are preventing the best and brightest from contributing to innovation.
However there is some truth that if the market is artificially inflating the value of minority groups then a business can get an edge on competition by being able to hire white male employees who are better and cheaper than their brown and female counterparts. But at that point you are basically making the argument that DEI is good because business get to underpay white staff.

i used to be modification electrician at Boeing. i left in 2021 to work for Tesla in Reno, NV. mostly decided to leave because of the rapidly rising cost of living (which was already insanely high) in the Puget Sound area, and the covid insanity that was happening there. after about 6 months, and realizing that Tesla was an even worse managed ESG/DEI disaster than what Boeing has become, I started applying to get rehired into my old position at Boeing. I've reapplied 3 times since. the first time, i got 2 interviews with recruiters. nailed the interviews, and thought i back was in, but after 2 weeks got an email saying i was no longer under consideration. 2nd time, get a no longer under consideration email within 24 hours. 3rd time, get an email saying i'm not eligible for rehire at Boeing. contact my old union rep, to see what's going on, and he bluntly told me the only reason i'm not getting the job is because Boeing's hiring priority is blacks, and indians above all other candidates. while white and east asian people are the last to be considered.
tons of good paying skilled jobs at Boeing are not being filled, but are constantly being posted and updated on their career site, offering generous relocation packages and huge referral bonuses. instead of hiring the best candidate for the job, they keep the position vacant until the right diversity hire comes along to fill the position.
it's insane watching what was once one of the best, and most respected companies in the world intentionally destroy itself.

The truth of declining power structures is much worse than most people realize. They think at one level of nuance and say, "Wow, hiring based on race, sexuality, religion, etc. they're not going to get the best candidates!"

In reality, the entire power structure becomes corrupt and eventually destroys itself from the inside. Bad actors are then able to leech off of the remaining power structure. They're not morally capable people so they're easily corrupted by outside forces (WEF being an easy pick). DEI hiring is just a method to get easily corrupted people into existing power structures. Do not engage with ANY DEI company at all. This must become common practice. The parallel economy will succeed.

Airbus will continue to win as long as they don't go insane with DEI stuff... Which is definitely not a certainty. We will have to see which way Germany and Europe breaks.. they are definitely more closed off than they were a decade ago.

Ironically Embraer might be the least susceptible to DEI as Brazil is such a shit hole that they can't give a fuck about diversity.

Other than that, better hope China comes up with a solid airliner before their population collapse becomes too severe.

The thing about DEI is that once it takes over a company it's too late to change. Even if the all white execs start to change course, they've already filled every lower management position with people who hate white males. They just aren't going to listen. Boeing is finished, as is every company that went full speed on DEI.

After Dallas Mavericks owner (((Mark Cuban))) simps for DEI and says organizations should reflect the demographics of America, Ohio senator J.D. Vance astutely points out that his basketball team consists of 90% niggers.

Imagine believing this crap.
In 2003 US invaded Iraq which had at the time the GDP of today's Slovenia. So the the US beated Slovenia at the cost of trillions of $ with tens of thousands of KIA, MIA, WIA, let alone many more casualties by suicide among the troops. That is what the US could/can do without a WWII-like mobilization, that is not even possible today because of DEI and whatnot. Get real.

Mark Cuban is an obnoxious billionaire faggot that's always running his mouth about stupid fucking shit. His latest thing is defending DEI, which stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Basically hiring niggers, faggots, and women over more qualified white people. Mark Cuban is also owner of the Dallas Mavericks, a basketball team in the United States. Wei Wu here thinks that Mark Cuban should put her on the Dallas Mavericks if he loves DEI so much. Why does basketball have to be dominated by tall black men, why not have an short Asian woman who barely speaks English on the team?

>Opus Dei
The first I heard about that was from the DaVinci Code. I don't know if that was an accurate depiction though. Was it?

I was lucky enough to have many experiences as a child that seem to be consistent with what Catholics called "beatific vision" so I was never attracted to aethism. However, many times I felt abandoned by God and acted out and became nihilistic but eventually I realised God hadn't abandoned me, rather I had abandoned God.

This faggot is attempting to slide the thread itself. Thus spamming nonsense. Glowniggers are BAD at their jobs. Guess your agency drank the DEI juice. I mean we used to have glowniggers who were somewhat good at deceiving mankind, who didn't fall for 9/11 at least initially? But the troons and shitskins can't keep up.

Let me take a wild guess....one of the anti-American kike banksters on Wall St. told the Alaskan Airlines CEO to "get your DEI score up higher stupid goyim or we won't give you any shekels." As such, Alaska Airlines went on a hiring spree and hired hundreds of brown mechanics. How close am I to the truth?

Wonder if their mexican mechanics get a free siesta break every 2 hours?

Anyway, lots of old heads in recent years coming out of those places, boeing, lockheed and the like, and they say it's getting bad the quality of people theyre hiring to build out new planes.
