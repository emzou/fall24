See picrel. It explains a lot about the current israel war via the leaked email and others. Plus, the way jews use us goyim and refuse to fight their own wars.
The DEI troon mutt troops are entitled, lazy, incompetent snowflakes. They'd serve no purpose other than meat shields to the real soldiers who left already.

They're also pushing iran trying to kill trump and other lies. To demonize them from now, to get republicans to rejoin the military- the patriotic white males who follow orders and are competent

the hypothetical character was naive (as was op's company) and subsequently, not concurrently, grew to understand the consequences of the company's action
it's not a simultaneous while, it's a chronological cause and effect
that is the comical part about it

you must be some sort of retarded subhuman nig chink (since you apparently hate poos) that doesn't understand simple logic and lacks all reading comprehension

Well it’s wrong
American gothic also called carpenters gothic buildings were built beginning in the 19th century and evolved later into the typical farm house style of that period
All be it striped of many of its gothic features
America gothic building are not built out of brick they also do not have Tudor chimneys or Tudor brick work designs or

Tudor revival was popular in the the late 19th century and early 20th when that house was built

It was obvious by the time covid happened that this was going to be the case anyway, covid just turned it from a gradual process that would have taken the entire decade to play out into an avalanche hitting all at once in 2024 because everyone had already heard how easy it is to get a job in tech making 6 figures just to dick around on a computer all day, then covid happened and everyone who was even considering entering the field was basically ushered into it because pretty much every other field had shut down at the time, plus everyone was saying "we're always going to need more coders" which was the most insane and idiotic thing I've ever heard, we absolutely will not always need more coders, as we see now, but they all signed on for degrees and certifications geared towards the tech industry in 2020 and the market is now oversaturated with them. It's really a niche market that only needs a small number of highly qualified members to run optimally, but now we have a massively over inflated market of under-qualified members who are all fighting for a spot on the bottom rung of the ladder to the point that skill isn't even a consideration to tech companies anymore, they already have all the highly skilled employees they're going to need for the next 2-3 decades, those guys aren't going anywhere, they get paid way too well to do way too little work to ever give it up. Now the tech job market is absolutely flooded with incompetent pajeets who are so bad at their jobs that the quality of the average app/website is actually getting worse rather than better because the only qualification tech companies care about for new hires is how little they're willing to accept to work at their company. Also being a retarded 3rd worlder scored their company DEI points or whatever. Either way, this was always going to happen to the tech-retards by 2030 anyway, the tech industry just happened to get a perfect storm in 2020 which accelerated the outcome as fast as possible

The Nazi paradox

The most comically inept and simultaneous villainous regime ever that only lasted 12 years. They somehow managed to engage in the greatest genocide ever using ACME level rube goldberg contraptions to kill Jews while fighting a multi front war. Making advances in rocketry and other endeavors. Being culturally autistic, rule following meticulous notetakers yet none of the logistics line up. Not to mention the fact that Hitler and Nazi Germany is constantly said to have taken inspiration from how the United States treated people which is conveniently where tons of Jews ran to and is the main target of all the DEI White people bad propaganda. Facing many of the same problems outlined in Mein Kampf. We supposedly won WW2, but if this is what defeating Nazis looks like then what the fuck would losing to them have looked like?

Get these useless niggers and spics their own special meat grinder divisions so men such as myself who can actually do math and read and write don't get wasted at the front or stuck under the command of men dumber than I am. I have no problem taking orders and respecting hierarchy but if the leadership is retarded I'd rather get discharged for disobeying orders than listen to Jamal or Juan.

If you want a military that is strong and capable then you open yourself up to the ideas of meritocracy, you look to the leadership of the past when our military was at its peak/height (i.e. WWII), you follow the behavior and wisdom of the men back then.

The whole reason you faggots can't recruit anybody is because you let corporate America poison your own nation, you refused to reign them in. More than half the country is obese. Fix your fucking shit and give me a good deal that allows me a future and maybe I'll die for Israel.

You seem to miss the fact that China is building more solar, wind and nuclear power than the rest of the world combined, and their energy mix is rapidly shifting away from expensive energy imports.

The robot grows food. Or maybe it makes iPhones, or Chryslers. Or even builds apartment buildings.

But I don't own the robot. I don't have any claim to its output. When it takes my job from me, the thing I will pursue will be starvation and hypothermia. Not because I want these things, but they will be the only avenue open.

The people likely to own the robot aren't philanthropists. They aren't saints. They do not love me.

I cannot steal from the robot. There are other mean-looking robots with guns standing next to it. The government can't do anything about this, the military is smaller than it used to be, filled with fat DEI hires. And if they misbehave, the robot delivery drivers won't deliver any more ammunition to them.

Some leftoids will whine about how the rich people have screwed themselves over, now that the economy is wrecked they can no longer be rich. But if they want a bigger yacht, the robots will build it for them. If they want $20,000 bottles of champagne or whisky, the robots will make that too. All the trappings of wealth are at their fingertips, even now. If Grandpa Redneck does have $100,000 squirreled away under a mattress it does him no good because they no longer accept currency. The rich just trade robot-hours amongst each other.

The situation sucks because I both understand and agree with the perspectives of both the zoomers and the new-boomers.

I understand that zoomers:

Are unmotivated because what the fuck do they have to be motivated by? Everything is too expensive and everyone is firing right now because DEI rot at the highest ranks of modern companies.

Zoomer prospects as a generation are in the gutter and they know it unless they have a clear path, support and no setbacks at all. Work without real incentive is basically indentured slavery. Demoralization everywhere which we all know is everything is having an effect.

However I also understand new-boomers.

They are right that is it is a problem that they lack initiative, drive and do the things that is needed to generate money to pay them with.

They do pay wages they think are reasonable and think you should just keep trading up and sort of "paying your dues".

Unfortunately the only reality because soulless corps are trying to suck every single dollar out of the common person with artificial pricing, wages aren't keeping up. Businesses can't afford to pay such high salaries and zoomers can't afford to not get paid a high salary and thus a complete impasse is formed.

The only solution I can see is actual market controls forced by the government (good luck) which fixes the price of rent to 30% of the average salary in the area (The real American way), commodities and lowering costs like when it comes to a car (First car tax credit or some shit) so zoom zooms can actually afford the wages they are given without raising the salaries. The exploitation of the market needs to end and living needs to be cheaper.

Frankly it's in businesses best own interest, we are finally seeing luxury commodities start to slow down. You can't sell your shit if no one has money, retards. But unfortunately they want to keep scalping forever.

I had black and latino co workers kicking white people out of their jobs in 2007. It was illegal and they never got in trouble. The whites who helped them were also pieces of shit. I had even made an offhand comment about not wanting to fuck black women after work hours. A guy got kicked out of college for basically the same thing 7 years later. They even tried to follow me to my next jobs.

I only work with people I know and am comfortable with now. I will never do a job again were I am forced to race mix, its just not worth it. As a white you will have to be professional all the time while the shitskin can be low IQ low impulse control while being paid basically the same and winning advancements off DEI.

What happened in the last 10-15 years, big companies killed the majority of small businesses.
Especially small business die-off happened during and after covid.
20 years ago small businesses provded over 50% of all jobs. Right now big companies are.
Right now US Gov is 2nd largest GDP sector after Finance.
Since US Gov is one of the largest GPD producers, most companies that survived rely on Government Contracts.

Underrated and factually correct.
The federal reserve will print money and disperse it to banks and equity/holding corporations (ie: black rock, vanguard etc).
The equity and holding corps produce nothing, their only job is to spend the money the fed gives them to get the currency into the market.
They buy land, stocks, offer incentive investing (DEI is this one), etc etc.
Other investments is very likely as well, like bitcoin and gold.

So this all pushes the commodities and asset markets up and makes all the prices for this shit very fake and gay.
This all then trickles into grocery bills and other daily costs.
Then workers demand a raise, but where the costs to live are up 9%, the employers give them 3%-5%. So they still lose income.

This is all designed in such a way so that the Jews at the very top get the newly printed money right away, before inflation has taken place, and each step of this process is designed to limit the inflationary effect on the new currency for those at the top (the first and second spenders).
The entire system is designed to steal value and wealth from the middle class.
Literally rich get richer and poor get poorer.

In the US, you have to keep statistics on the racial backgrounds of who applied and who got hired. What will happen is Rajesh Rapejeet will apply to your medical practice (because of course they will) and you won't hire him, and he will cry discrimination to the authorities. In fact they do this even when there is no discrimination, because they are weaponizing our own laws against us. Then you'd better be able to convince your Jewish federal DEI expert judge that your all-white medical practice isn't racist.

If they remove him its just going to be a rush job and the game will release as the worst ac game of all time. Their best bet is to scrap the entire project fire all the women at ubi and dei, the board needs to shitcan yves and sell the franchise to someone who is a competent developer.

If ubi releases ac groid, its going to be a massive loss with no chance to recuperate any revenue at all and all of ubi will fold.

Thats kind of the joke. Some of them are for hydro power, most are, in fact, for flood control.
Rain comes down, river flow is checked at every dam. Open the locks so water level stays right below flood line all the way down. Reserve capacity of the dams holds excess acre-feet as the crest moves down the mountain. Unless you let the lakes fill all summer then ignore it while a huge storm moves up and your DEI training didn't cover water management and flow rates.

By Jewish logic, if more colored entertainers get thrown under the bus, people will forget about the very obvious fact that Jews are the masterminds behind all this shit.

Jew support nepotism disguised as meritocracy. Look at Intel and all the American companies that are failing. Know why? DEI, but not in the way you'd think. They used DEI during the woke era to purge the White Goyim who they were stealing their ideas from, who were actually running the show. After the purges, Jewish management was left with Jeets and Chinks.

If Jewish management were "so successful because they're smart" like they're always bragging about, they would have innovated and made intelligent choices. Nope, they're not smart, turns out they know only how to hustle enough for a bump on next quarter's profits. They accomplish this by making planes fall out of the sky and top-end microchips explode as results of totally preventable causes.

I was lucky to graduate before the total takeover by Jewish venture capital and the rapejeet infestation of our hospitals. I got my placement and paid off my debts. But when I look at all the young doctors, it's all Indians from India now. In medical colleges, the number of whites and asians going into medicine has completely crashed, and it's mostly jeets, jews, and blacks who are getting in with DEI quotas. And they don't go in because they want to help people, they go in just for status and so they can drive a BMW- literally the worst people you want to be doctors.

I would never advise a high school graduate in America to go into medicine especially if they have that special personality doctors have. I would tell them to go to Europe and work there because it's the only place they will be safe. Here they will just get big debts and find their jobs being replaced when they graduate. Going into IT/Software engineering is probably the only white middle class job that still exists for now, and yes I know they have the same Indian problem but its still easier to succeed.

>Stop posting Dagoth, you're just reminding me that TES:6 is gonna be a DEI montrosity.

Forget about TES:6 it's going to be Starfield 2 either way.
Every TES game after Morrowind was just a modding sandbox. The only point of Oblivion's existence was modding the big ass titties, and same went for Skyrim.

The kicker is that since Skyrim they failed to meaningfully upgrade their engine, it's still the morrowind engine except with generations of facelifts butthe same shitty and faulty core.

At this point nobody needs Tes6, you know for a fact that Bethesda are incapable of making the core game any good, frankly they were never good, and the modding sandbox is really obsolete too. It's 2024 the kids are making badass mobility shooters in Roblox, and in case you forgot UNREAL EXISTS, nobody needs a shitty modding sandbox anymore, it's better and easier to make your own game in unreal than to fuck with the morrowind engine.

TES6 has no reason to exist. And neither has the bethesda studio. I hope they go bankrupt and sell the Fallout franchise to somebody good.

IOI had good devs, but countless times we saw that DEI in charge lead to all those good devs leaving and being replaced by poos. I'd say the next Hitman has an 80 to 90% chance of being garbage. In any case, never get hyped up for a game before it's released and you get the actual steam or metacritics reviews from users.

making good games is never enough, many studios have failed trying just that and releasing at the wrong time. but this shit? Star Wars outlaws was a bad game, functionally and thematically. it was mired in DLC shit before we even knew the lead characters name.

DEI was never a problem, its when its clearly a design by committee forced introduction of a character because a cabal of weirdos want to try and sell more games to a wider audience without catering to the audience they originally cultivated. every game now has to run through 8 filter groups who get paid to go "what if woman strong? what if lead black and lesbian? what if all straight people bad?" and sure in the hands of good writers who want to tell that story it could be good, this is just the end result of corporate designed games

When interest rates were low they could use it to effectively get 0% interest loans from these firms and pad out fake growth. The investment firms investing DEI dollars don’t care as it isn’t their money and they get 1% of any movement in fees and charge a premium for investors to park their money in these funds and loans.

Essential they are taking your retirement, taking a cut of it to manage it, in fees and then investing it in social engineering against you. Essentially they found a way to charge you for your own propaganda. When interest rates were low everyone was making money, covid shocking the supply chain was an unpredictable event and pushed interest up. The companies that were geared up for producing DEI products from your embezzled retirement funds suddenly had to sell product to you instead of these retirement funds. For a bit you were the product, now they have to sell products to you.

They wanted someone from the west coast because Chicago and NY are extremely corrupt. They didn't want another Hillary situation where an unexpected scandal rocks the campaign 2 days before the election.

They wanted someone that can get the minority vote, and she checks 3 minority boxes(black, woman, indian). This is the DEI part you're probably obsessing over.

They wanted someone that isn't old as fuck. Biden and Trump are both extremely old. Having a younger candidate creates a situation like 1992 and 1960 where the younger person looks more presidential.

They wanted someone that isn't a progressive, because the dems would rather let America fall to the kikes than let a progressive be president.

They're retiring in a few years, it's the zog way of silently removing that sort of stuff to avoid drama and a media firestorm for high ranks like that. The 2025 NDAA is also projected to remove all funding towards DEI stuff and removing DEI administrative positions, with specific prohibitions on transgender and drag queen stuff if I recall correctly.

>ussf xo being political
That's a government-wide policy on political neutrality for federal and state employees. Military tends to get publicly ripped open compared to the postmaster general. It's stupid but it's there to avoid an overt entrenchment of political bias that hurts mission outcomes. You can see the consequences when neutrality isn't adhered to, i.e. DEI entrenchment. /pol/ of all boards should know about this but they're all new these days and don't read anything.

2025 NDAA is projected to give junior enlisted a much larger pay bump. Estimates are up to 19.5% for junior enlisted, plus the projected 4.5% bump for all troops. Is it sufficient? Depends on inflation rate. Those pay bumps were actually unanimously agreed upon.

Also, a few Congressmen really stand out for trying to ungay the military. Personally a fan of Paul "69 is Nice" Gosar.

Pride FUTURE 2030

It’s the year 2030. The World Economic Forum's implementation of DEI and SDG’s has led to even more heinous laws and legislations that allow adults and queer people to have intimate relations with little children. This is an extremely dangerous and unacceptable situation that must be stopped immediately. It is crucial for individuals to take action and prevent this from happening by actively engaging in political activism, contacting their representatives, and raising even more awareness about the dangers of these laws. Failure to do so will result in a society that prioritizes the desires of adults over the safety and well-being of children and will result in the complete degradation of our moral fabric. It is time for people to get off their asses and take action before it's too late.

Here is a peek into the future:

It’s because of DEI and female hiring as truck drivers they can’t into manuals.

Leftists, leftist women, jews and other people with similar brains are obviously 100x more power hungry than some relatively normie or mildly aspie engineer or architect who mostly wants to do their own thing or STEM stuff. That explains why 90% of juornalists and such are those types, even if there are some diversity and woman quotas, but men don't even apply or show interest. I realize that the interest falls even lower if they know they have to work in a 80-100% woman environment for example.

These power hungry people are ready to go to school for 10 years just so they get a chance to fuck White (males) over and spend 24/7 of their lives thinking about it and networking to fuck whitey over and then gaslight them about it. Like, everyone can quickly calculate that DEI or "diversity" always means "less White people/men" and they have to gaslight or lie about it so it's not 100% obvious. These people make career of it, some of them have done this shit for 50 years already as a full time job. I repeat, these people are ready to go to school say ages 20-29 just so they get a ngo or government job to fuck White people over.

Thanks for sharing that anon. Half a world away and the story is mostly the same. You could always come to Canada, I give away more than half my paycheck to pedophiles in Ottawa, I have personal health insurance and socialized Healthcare, yet I had to pay $60k out of my pocket for 2 of my surgeries. The wait time to have some DEI doctor operate on you here is 151 weeks. I got to choose my surgeon, he is white, top of his field. Not so sure about the anesthesiologist after this ordeal. They want me to get a blood patch to seal the hole in my spine but I'm honestly terrified to let anyone touch me at this point. America would have been better, my profession in the states would offer high end health insurance, quick surgery times but I'd still be paying taxes to pedophiles. You can't win.

Yes, jews jew one-another. The J-10 is also a pretty alright fighter, and people like to piss on the Chinese aerospace but it's already objectively ahead and superior to Russian counterparts, and is becoming, rather quickly, a genuinely impressive force. The Chinese have already been ahead of Americans with consumer goods innovations, and considering Boeing's shortcomings thanks to DEI communists, I won't be surprised if Chinese aerospace development overtakes American equivalents by 2060 if globohomo wins

I live in the the most right wing town in America, Trumpville (We changed our name to celebrate Trump's 2016 win) Nobody has ever voted for a Democrat in our town since its founding in 1828. In the 1944 presidential elections, "FDR's polio" won the popular vote, Hitler came in 2nd and Dewey in 3rd. When came back from a tour with the Army (Russian of coarse, I ain't serving in no DEI US Army) I was shocked to see Harris-Waltz signs in every yard. I asked my Dad, George Lincoln Rockwell III what happened. Now my dad's no namby pamby liberal, He works 18 hours in a coal mine and comes home to beat his wife every night. On his weekends if he's not at church he's out hunting baby seals with his whomping club. He said son, ever since Kamala took control, the economy has been fixed, we've not had a war and everything just runs right. Then the town mayor, Adolf Pinoche Babykiller popped by to let me know that he didn't leave the Republican party, it left him, Trump and plan 2025 were just too darn radical, JD Vance was Weird and January 6th was in fact both an insurrection and worse than 9/11. Then Donald Trump himself appeared and let me know even he was hoing to vote for Harris because she earned it and was a better choice and he would drop out but that "he legally still has to run" Then we all did Republican things together like saying the N word and guns. So if you are a Republican you should just stay home this year. If Trump can't even win his own vote we already lost.

No, when I realized what a joke the whole thing was I did what was required to get out. There was zero patriotism or idealism involved. It was a degraded, trashy shell of what it once was. When it was almost all white in the 1920s-1960s, white male officers, white male everything, that was a good time. But the DEI stuff has ruined it.

But the whole thing just sucked. The drills sergeants were potato looking beaners and blacks. The other enlistees were 70 IQ trash who just needed 3 square meals per day.

Your deflections are so predictable. Begin tlaking about a shill point, get debunked, move onto another shill point.

first off, you don't live here. you're a traitor who ran away. none of our laws affect you anymore. we'll deal with our problems, you deal with yours in Vietnam.

trump's overall tax plans help everyone. his no tax on overtime helps mostly whites. no one in here wants more taxes. every step in the right direction is a good step. there is no "solving everything at 100% solution."

his mass deportation and vetted immigration is 25 million times better than Kamala bringing in another 25 million illegal niggers to rape kids and beat up cops and mug white people.

and Trump has made fighting anti white racism, DEI, critical race theory, etc. a part of his policy platform. he already delivered on this in his first term, he'll do it again.

these are the same three shill points you've cycled through for the past 24 hours.

you don't live here. you're a traitor who ran away. none of our laws affect you anymore. we'll deal with our problems, you deal with yours in Vietnam.

All of this DEI stuff is the result of finance guys getting in charge of these companies and implementing policies designed to destroy unions. That's why wall street loves it so much. They get cheap low quality labor in there to replace the high cost union workers, and then they put people in management who will bend the rules on QC and rubberstamp the work that is done.

Current legislation around the world is such that it's basically a suicide wish for men to get married.

From child support to alimony, from false rape accusations to false domestic violence accusations.

Female standards and entitlements and privileges are through the roof while men have to face DEI discrimination and slavery (alimony).

So how can this problem be fixed?

I liked IT work like 12 years ago. I could talk shit, tell racist jokes in company chat, and IT work was still almost all on-prem since "the cloud" was a meme. With work on-prem you felt like king of the castle. You had WSUS and controlled exactly which updates got pushed and when. So, nothing broke because you weren't using 100 online services ran by jeets making changes that are impossible to keep up with and break shit constantly. The only thing that could randomly break overnight was hardware. Very few factors were totally outside your control beyond the ISP itself.
It's when globohomo culture completely took it over that it became Chinese water torture. Then women started being elevated. Remember the show IT Crowd? The premise of that show is two nerds doing IT for a company, and a clueless female manager becomes their boss. It was seen as unrealistic that someone who could barely open an email would be head of IT, in fact it was so unrealistic at the time it was considered comedic. It's now the norm. And not just one female boss, there's SHITLOADS of them all doing useless work like "Product Manager", "Project Manager" , "Process Analyst", "associate director", "asset analyst" etc. they don't do anything at all. They create work for the people doing the work (the men) to actually do. It's literal makework that isn't satisfying to do and accomplishes nothing.
All these women, basiclaly checking boxes of makework, will get paid double what you make. They will complain about "busy days" because they had "back to back meetings all day".
It's extremely obvious that if we had a real monetary system, these jobs would not exist because they provide no value to the company. They exist solely to keep women babysat and away from home becoming good wives and mothers. They are only profitable for the company because they literally get paid due to DEI and ESG, which wouldn't exist with hard money.

I have never seen anyone be racist to a black person in Canada in my entire life. In fact, they were often revered in my school and were treaded very kindly by everyone. They were like everyone else, y'know? But now they're trying to spread this propaganda that blacks are victims and they need help. It's so weird even my black friends are like wtf. The government is so disconnected from society its like 1984. The more we focus on this stupid pandering bullshit the more people get pissed off, and then they legit become real racists because they feel disadvantaged. This seriously all started when they introduced DEI, they hired these fuckwits that don't know anything other than white people bad.

*gives your hand a gentle squeeze*
Anon-senpai, if you're going to make the argument that the officials on the ground are eschewing telling the truth despite it being, politically speaking, in their best interests, you're going have to explain why.
To reiterate, the:
* Springfield Mayor
* Springfield City Manager
* Springfield PD
* Governor of Ohio
Have all come out and said these stories are unsubstantiated. All of these officials are Republicans or otherwise would be incentivized to back these claims. You're telling me the Springfield PD wouldn't be itching to back this? It's basically a free excuse for a budget increase.
To be clear, Springfield is in Clark County, which voted 60% for DJT in 2020. This isn't commiefornia we're talking about, this is MAGA territory.
If the narrative is true - that the radical woke DEI (Didn't Earn It!) Replacist Biden-Harris administration is busing 20K Haitian niggers who are a burden to the city's economy, infrastructure, and are sucking up jobs and welfare and EATING pets - then these are the people you would expect to be screaming that from the rooftops.
But they're not. Interesting.
If you can explain why without resorting to (((mirthful businessmen))) that would be nice, thanks.

It isn't that women are successful at careers. They don't do shit at work. For the vast majority of women, work is a daycare that they get paid to go to and they are more of a hindrance to the productive men than anything else. But, because of DEI shit, they get hired and fail upwards at the speed of light. It isn't anything you can do to match them. You don't get to have those opportunities because you're a straight white male. The only option the working world has for you is to do all the heavy lifting for as little as they can legally get away with.

The aircraft crashed on approach to March AB around 15:40 hours local. The pilot ejected safely. The aircraft crashed in a warehouse fortunately not injuring anyone.
>The cause of the mishap was an improper installation of two hydraulic check valves in the right Flaperon Integrated Servo Actuator (FISA) which resulted in a loss of sufficient hydraulic pressure to control the aircraft.

The games didn't fail because of DEI content. They failed because DEI companies are incompetent and incapable of making good products, regardless of content. DEI is a destructive ideology that ruins any organization it manages to usurp. The failure is on the part of the entire organizational structure, not just because the main character was an ugly black lesbian. Just so we correctly attribute cause and effect in this conversation.

When Genshin got released Ubisoft was already touting they were making AAAA games to justify the highway robbery(70$ + 40$ season passes and whatever the fuck microtransactions were expecting for a cookie cutter DIE infested game).
Gachashit by contrast, you already expect it to be a glorified slot machine. Genshin just happens to be high effort enough to attract westoids(despite the constant reeing from the DIE shills about the game being too white).

There is no plan the jews make it up on the spot.
Ubisoft has been failing for a decade but you didnt hear anything about it until now. Thats by design.
The media coverage itself is an SOS for their DEI gibs provider to step in and give them more money for free.
Ubisoft says they cancelled 5 releases before this news broke out. Do we even trust them with that information? Its probably bullshit. They werent working on anything. They could say they are working on games with inclusive shit for DEI and let their stock holders + donors think they're working when they arent.

Its more convenient to blame failure on the audience than it is to blame a CEO, because this way everyone gets to keep their job.
What Ubisoft is doing is trying to make money without doing work (through DEI gibs) AND the games they do make are not meant to be high effort because that defeats the purpose of cash grabbing the audience.
They can make slop forever and keep the infinite money machine going forever too, even with poor audience reception.

This isnt the end of Ubisoft. This is when the Jewish donors like Blackrock start relentlessly pumping this company to the brim with VC money to keep it afloat.
No one will acquire them. They will make more shit games that no one buys and still make money.

Even Ubisoft's own employees understand that DEI kills their company, hell most of them do not even think what they're doing is the actual "inclusion" or "diversity"
they basically have a whole bunch of marxists in the middle managment/consultancy that will tell them their own vision of diversity and inclusion that nobody lower than them is able to question, and nobody higher up cares about "as long it makes them money"
and guess what, it no longer makes the money and is nothing more than a liability

I disagree. I think people ought to learn it because it gives them "handles" on a concept and thus it takes less brainpower to manipulate that concept in the future, enabling people to reach further in their conclusions. Take something like the concept of DEI. It would be quite difficult to talk about if it didn't have a name. We'd have to contrive long phrases to describe them and explain that there's a dedicated effort in the financial space to enforce left wing ethics using the lure of investor money and dumb people, the foot soldiers of any ideology, would forget it quickly. Now we only have to say three letters and people instantly get it. It's the same for something like microaggressions: the academic term for slights against a minority group that justifies social ostracizations and demands immediate groveling apology. They can use the term to suggest that your slight is equivalent to every slight a member of the white race has ever done to their group just by saying it. Even though the concept is dumb, just having it changes the landscape of any argument. Something like OP did here where he says that his opponent is affirming the consequent is a similar magic word that, as long as the opponent knows what it is, will end the argument. Even if the person is dumb, they only have to hold two logical statements in their head, which is possible for anyone. Once it's crystallized and no longer has to be in the small working memory, even the dumbest retard understand it.

And that's just when they're invoked as a magic word. By having the concept handle, you can contort, refute, and transform it any way you want, even apply adjectives to it. Goyslop becomes [x]slop becomes [x]chow becomes any number of combinations and once one of those combinations prove memetically useful, it will take over and be invoked as a magic word by retards and bigbrains alike. Learn as much terminology as you can. Even stuff you only learn for fun can be rhetorically powerful.

DEI AMERIMUTT TROOPS FOR THE WIN!!!!
Luckily they fucked over the loyal ehite man so hard, over anf over again for many years. That none of the troops that left fue to covid vaxx o t other reasons are returning. Not even with backpay and their records cleaned, and evetything fixed. Even the minority military families that fought for generations, have told their kids not to join at any cost.

Obama, biden, and the rntire woke, tranny, and DEI movements have obliterated the military. USA invented hypersonic missile technology, and then obama forced usa to halt all research. Which is why USA is now so far behind russia and china. We're left with scrawny girls, fags and troons. All of which only care about themselves, are super entitled, not patriotic, and would flee the country or go to jail with free room and board, rather than fight for USA. Let alone for israel, as minorities hate jews and israel. They kicked out the ONLY demographic that had loyalty to israel and blindly followed orders, the patriotic white males.

Ubisoft has a pretty interesting history.
They started out as okay dudes, like EA, then turned into the literal gaming antichrist, again like EA except for Europe, then they made a real effort to gid gud again, which succeeded somewhat, and then over the last 5 years or so they fell straight down the DEI hole and once again teeter to the brink.
It might well be that now DEI gets the stick and they again begin the slow climb back to respectability.
Considering prior history however; losing steam with each such cycle, they don't have a lot of life left in them.

It's actually less dire than that
Jews don't like white supremacy, to be fair
They actually don't like any ethnic supremacy, but they lived in white countries, and white countries dominate, so that's their primary target
They also plan to dismantle Hindu, Japanese, Han, and even shockingly Black and Indigenous identities in the future (once Whites are suitably humbled and made minorities)
There's no point doing this now since breaking Intersectionality now would thwart the defeat of White supremacy

But as to why Jews hate Whites? Truth be told, they don't necessarily. The Chabads do, but they're like ultra-right Dominionists.
Rather, White populations are in terminal decline. Everyone on pol knows this. It's been this way for decades. White and East Asian people aren't breeding. However, White people have real guilt over their past actions. East Asians don't and remain nationalistic.
Whites thus can be exploited to import the brown and black third world. The left is told to believe this is diversity, inclusion, and a form of reparations. The right is whipped into a frenzy to think this is White genocide.
The cold, hard, and ugly truth is that this is just to keep the shekels flowing in and prevent White countries' economies from imploding like Japan or South Korea's.

Browns in the West are eager consumers and, in due time, cheap workers.
But the cold fact is that even the Browns aren't breeding either. Not anymore. Indian birthrates are collapsing. African birthrates are falling hard. Immigration is a neoliberal bandaid.
They're trying to run out the clock, either before catastrophe, or to get to AI. Otherwise, it falls apart.

2008 was the warning sign things needed to be sped up to keep up the grift, hence why DEI accelerated around 2013-2015. Before then, they were fine with delaying a White minority.
Whites checked out after 2008.

Sexual orientation is free to choose like in Odyssey.
Most of the in-game content can be kept, just need to change the MC's lines about their home country.

lmao, only on paper. We all know that the incel with a "computer science" degree isn't worth wiping the shit of someone with a degree in engineering, physics, or math. You can easily train the SEM to build software, you can't do the reverse. Tech/CS is Gender Studies for men.

After the amount of companies destroyed by Hindu rape rats taking over them, the jews are surely panicking. China has been winning at every step, now they are making great strides in silicon manufacturing. I see the kikes pivoting to anti-woke anti-DEI positions now because they are panicking, but I don't think they will be able to remove the Hindu rapejeets now that they are so thoroughly embedded in all FAGMAN big tech companies.

Jews and Jeets took 'em all, and now that DEI is gone there's nothing stopping them from continuing to hire themselves.

Americans should start going to big tech employers in their area and take pictures of randos walking in and out of the buildings, then blurring out their faces and posting them on X or Tik Tok.

Guaranteed to be Jews, Jeets, and Chinks. We should continue to harass them in public about this until they start hiring White American Goyim again.

Same way if the USA could presumably be toppled in no short order, they let the enemies through the gates.

Just like today with DEI and giving positions to the lowest common denominators like descendants of African slaves, Spanish slaves(Mexicans), and Mughal slaves(Indians), and even allowing 5th column traitor Chinese(Japanese slaves at one time), and of course the eternal jew(the great deceivers) the weakest races to come in and "integrate" themselves into all our institutions to weaken them for their host nations. It all follows parallels of allowing the conquered into Roman society. The Gauls, the Germanics, what are now modern day Balkan peoples, etc. Allowing them in and letting them influence Roman politics was their undoing in so many ways. America is doing the same thing right now.

>The "old guard" in all of the Companies (Worldwide) were silently, slowly let go
I think people in the industry are naturally susceptible to peer/social pressure. You know, the kind of people who rather than thinking "is my opinion correct?" they think "is my opinion acceptable or would it get me in trouble?".
Take into account that many of the OG devs ended up in some DEI gay shit later on (like one of the co-founders of Blizzard, from the times of Diablo, created a dev company exclusively for gays). As a matter of fact, one of the DA:O devs/writers (if I'm not mistaken) came out in defense of Veilguard saying Dragon Age has always been inclusive.

They're not woke because they believe in it, they're so because it's the Status Quo. If that changed, they'd also change.

You know what? Its absolutely mindboggling how this all happened even in Video Games. DEI shit. So, Assassins Creed 1 - Maybe you remember, because it was so positively regarded because of the amazing details. Constantinople, the characters, the weapons, the outfits, everything was clearly researched in a way that was right. Developers went to the places in the game in real life, photographed etc.
NOW there is CHINESE stuff in a game that is portraying Japan. How is that even possible? For me, the answer is clear: The "old guard" in all of the Companies (Worldwide) were silently, slowly let go and blacks, gays, lesbians, trans people have been put in their places. The result? Assassins Creed: Shadows. Last of Us Part II. Concord. Dragon Age Vailguard or whatever the name is. Women in FIFA. Mostly women Main Characters. Trans and Gay characters FORCED into the stories. And much, much more.

The Taiwanese have no counter that doesn't result in the immediate destruction of their military when the Chinese ultimately prevail.

This is essentially about white dominance.
Just like America during slavery. Whites don't get mad at them for being surrounded by blacks, but they do get mad at them for not being slaves.
The Democrats' DEI program has in fact undermined white privilege, and whites no longer get to rule this country.
This is the main reason whites are frustrated.
The race that really rules America now is the Jews and they don't care about the future of whites.

Law school is not a good choice in America. It’s the single most oversaturated field by far.

The hard truth is that the only people still making real money and are wall street sees and the entrepreneurs they invest in. If you want to get wealthy, you have to figure out a way to become one of them. If you just want to be somewhat successful then you can do basically any career but you have to find your way to the top bucket of people doing it. A university President can make millions, but you’re going to working your ass off as a professor and administrator for decades and dealing with DEI shit. A good lawyer can make millions, but you’re going to be doing shit grunt work and dealing with DEI shit for decades. Honestly, the DEI shit is the biggest problem because it means you’re getting sidelined to promote women and blacks. That’s what I’m seeing at the organizations I’ve worked for. It’s impossible for white men to advance. So they get stuck at the bottom rung in more or less skilled jobs.

Most of these terrorist/freedom fighter organizations are puppeteered by Israel as we saw during the Syria General days when ISIS apologized to Israel for accidentally attacking their forces.

The conflict rapidly spreading out across the middle east is the ideal approach for the Greater Israel project and one that they hope to keep going, the only issue is this gambit was (seemingly) built upon the notion that their puppets would come to their aid but unfortunately their DEI hiring and recruitment practices that they have afflicted my country with caused an oil tanker to sink and significantly delay or possibly even render impossible our ability to assist them with jets and a carrier.

As a peasant who loves science I hate to say this but perhaps paying people to do science is a mistake. Once people do science to collect a paycheck, that is liable to corrupt everything.

For every autistic Newton or Faraday there will be a thousand I gotta pay my Bills.

Maybe science was better when it was a hobby for rich dillatantes and a few others. The barrier to entry tuition represented probably kept out many talented peasants, leaving only a few pure virtuosos lucky enough to be sponsored by those with means.

It would have been the opposite of DEI. Barriers would have meant only the pinacle of peasant talent would be represented at all and the culture would have been one of incorruptibility due to wealth.

If the wealthy wanted to be corrupted after all, they could do that without being scientists.

Imagine trying to corrupt Trump's golf game with money.

It is like Poos ruining tech. Sure there are a few legit ones but any benefit they could bring is swamped and dwarfed by the culture of yes-man-ism and nepotism of Poos en-masse bring.

I work for a big software company in infosec. The high paying software jobs are still there, and they’re mostly remote, but the days of being able to do nothing all day are gone. Companies have fired the DEI faggots and need quality staff that can actually produce. If you’re good, you’ll have high paying jobs.

Companies are realizing that offshoring to pajeet for $5 per hour is not a workable strategy because they’re just getting shit products that then take $200k per year Americans to fix.

Of course, that's why Japan is still in existence. That post is saying the concentration of brown people is in the 20 most populated cities here. To nuke those cities would revert our national demographics back 60 years, effectively ending all the dei garbage and tranny shit as they'd make up 20% of the population rather than the 60+% today. I don't give a shit what the statistics say, when nearly every city nationwide has been infested with the brown horde that's at least half the population. Hitting Europe would make it 99% white again. The loss of life would be devastating but it would also undo the mess the boomers made.

Not to be that guy because I really don't believe a draft will ever take place in Western countries, but Russia has never mobilized beyond 25% of their troops and are primarily using reservist troops.

China has over 350 million military aged males right now but most importantly control lithium mines and a lot of tech through brain drain and the west thinking it's wise to let them do all the small stuff.

Remember how USA wanted to bring chip manufacturing back to USA and it completely failed even with billions thrown at it because of DEI? It's not like you can all of a sudden teach retarded zoomies how to make complex electronics and maintain technical devices. A US military report stated that over 60% of their MILITARY tech is reliant on Chinese manufacturing.

I've been defending Concord for a while now and I've probably seen every post/video online made by its other defenders, and I've come to the conclusion that the game genuinely did not deserve to fail.

What happened was, anti-woke crusaders and close-minded gamers saw that it looked vaguely similar to Overwatch, deemed it a "leftist" product for just having pronouns and a couple brown characters, and decided to smear the game's name from its first reveal trailer all the way up until release. Only about 10% of the criticisms levied against the game even revolve around its actual gameplay.

Then when this false equivalency and woke-bashing came to a boil, the narrative shifted. People claimed that they weren't insulting the game for merely existing, but that it was "competing in an oversaturated market" (not true, by the way) or that "the modern audience has spoken" whatever that is supposed to mean.

And yet, the few thousand people who actually played Concord almost collectively agree that the game had an appeal which was totally at odds with all of the noise from social media outlets. It was as if the public's idea of a game they had no intention of playing became larger than the product, and the weight of that idea crashed down and the studio had no choice but to pull the plug.

So even as a guy who hates woke shit, hates leftist signaling, hates the very notion of DEI... I really feel bad for Concord and it's my hope that as more time goes by people will realize that, even if you think it deserved to fail, it was indeed trying to do something new. One example was that it wasn't a live service, at least not to the extent of Apex Legends or Valorant, because the developers' main goal was to have all the content available to everyone, make each character fun to play and actually offer a quick drop-in, drop-out experience instead of a second job.

And no this isn't a bait post or copypasta in case anyone cares.

How modern video games work (especially from medium - large studios) is that while they are developing their games which can take years they get loans from banks to pay the talent, the payroll of the company.

DEI is a system invented by Larry Fink where every corporation looking for a loan must first acquire enough "points", the less "diverse" the video game is the more points the company loses. If you lose enough points then you don't get a loan, if you go far into the negative the credit companies will blacklist your product and you will lose most of your sales. It is a system of total legalized blackmail.

This. Their DEI niggers simply fucked up in 2016, either because of their estimates or by the logistics of the whole thing. But it's been obvious that rigging goes on all over the place in this country. The "hanging chad" nonsense back in 2000 was especially comical and paved the way for other fun voting machine shenanigans that worked well in the news cycle then and will continue to work in the future.

I don't know if he hates us, although his Talmud doesn't exactly speak nicely of us. But it's clearly in the jewish interest to dilute white countries. It's the absolute surest way of preventing what happened in the 1940s. And Larry Fink is not just promoting his stuff in his own company, he uses his company's enormous funds to get other companies to do so, on an absolutely massive scale.

christian Augustine comments on this in civitas dei - why would anyone worship any other god that "success"?
is this one above all others? isn't this one always a winner if a struggle occurs?
Fortuna I think was her name
yes - mutltitude of gods were necessary for romans, and only one for christians

But there have been female guard models since what, 2nd Ed? Rogue trader? I remember my death company rhino rushing a few of them in 3rd Ed and they weren't new models at that point.

Ultramar is the most cosmopolitan realm in the entire Imperium so it's not really a big DEI push to have a black and chink astartes in the UM. They don't have one of the gene seeds that physically changes your ethnicity like Salamanders or Raven Guard or (possibly) blood angels (never been explicitly stated but seems that insanguination just turns everyone into a Von Carstein.

I can tell you from personal experience that the DEI agenda doesn't give two shits about disabled folk. Especially physically disabled folk. Hell, they've made it exponentially harder to find work as a physically disabled person, and it was already bad enough before. The only people they care about are African Americans, and that's only because they see them as tools they can market to and pander to for good-boy points that only investment firms care about.

>"contains overtly pro DEI messaging"
This is false. These caricatures of the "far right" are made by the woke/ far left. The woke is losing leftists because they are not as into transexual surgeries for children, non-binary ugly characters, and black supremacy. Having a white, masculine, handsome male lead is the most anti-woke thing possible, for example. The way to get leftists back is by making bs posts like this saying the alternative is siding with racists that want you dead.

Ubisoft decided sometime ago that the key to their marxist, globalist, satanic pro islamic aims was to revise history and subvert history and the future through their games. This was always going to fail do to pure economics of ending up with a game no one wants except the fairies who don't play games anyways unless it reinforces the lies they want to hear. Small audience is the result, smaller income is result. The consistently doubled down on woke or dei or whatever ideological nuttery and were likely being subsidized by progressive governments and WEF type organizations. But you can not make gamers like something foul to the average healthy person, they know what they like and would just go elsewhere. Leftists and left path zealots believe falsely that everyone is the same in order to be no left behind in stats or worth. Leftism is inherently the weaker human side of politics and when they lie to themselves about this reality, they go feral and come up with all sorts of stupid ideas to bring everyone down to their level. It is great UBIsoft fails and selling the AC franchise so it can be redone without the agendas would be a billion dollar boon for some company.

It's weird that back in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s many movies has black characters but they never felt forced. The only meme was about black characters being the first to die in action or horror films but that's it. Characters were actual characters and not some forced dei shit like now, which is probably even more racist if you think about it because every black woman is a fat "hell naaaawww" sassy annoying character, blacks are dressed like elves and wizards and shit and the villains are always white. And it seems it's only blacks too, Asians and Hispanics don't really give a shit about representation. Any media that portrays a Mexican wearing a sombrero and taking a nap will be liked by actual Mexicans, but third generation Chicanos and white libshits will make a big deal out of it and cry cuz muh cultural appropriation micro aggression or whatever flavor of the month buzzword is trending

Off the top of my head now that I think about it, I don't think the first Matrix had much DEI. Lawrence Fishburne is a legitimately great actor for the part. The sequels were full of it though.
Fight Club didn't have much if I recall though the messaging could go either way based on interpretation. Seems based to me though it's been a few years.

Overall, I don't think mere wokeness is as much of an issue to games as greedy Jewry is, as well as only targeting the lowest common denominator (which is part of greedy Jewry). AAA games began to be bad long before these DEI firms became a thing. It makes me think the people who care so much about this don't actually care about video games, as they must not have been following them for the past decade or so to understand this.

They just want to get their hours n go. They will rush things, they will ignore safety regulations, as long as they get the job done quickly.

There are rare cases of Downies with average or above average intelligence who are semi functional. They still have unpredictable violent outbursts but are better at controlling them. Because less mentally deficient means a higher functioning pre-frontal cortex. Sadly, this is the reason why elective abortions of Downies are done because they can be a danger to other children. For the few high functioning ones who are OK, they are too heavily outnumbered by violent stupid ones.

But this one is not the first to earn a PhD. A few have before DEI was even a thing. It's like her parents got 20 revolvers loaded each with five bullets and played Downie Russian roulette and won. Sort of lucky bastards.

>30 years ago an American boy scout troop would have exterminated the Houthis in a single weekend
No. The Houthis are peasants in sandals with AK's. They have nothing worth blowing up, really. However, I will give credit where it is due: They're hard motherfuckers as individuals.
>now the navy is pooping their pants because they put Brownoids and Trannies in charge hahahaha
Again, no.
While the DEI woke agenda has much to do with it, that's not the reasoning behind the situation.
The problem is that militaries train to fight and win the last war. Not the next war.
The Houthis don't have anything - but they can afford to buy heavily discounted cheap mass-produced weaponized drones from the Iranians, Russians, Chinese...
Turns out, the only thing that can stop a swarm of thousand dollar drones is a billion dollar warship shooting million dollar missiles.
That's not sustainable. It's so "not sustainable" that the Navy does not even bother training to rearm at sea. Because there's nothing to rearm WITH. So why practice it?
So now everyone who has been investing heavily in weaponized drones is ahead of us. Hypersonic missiles as well, but that is a different subject.

They have basically made so even highly specialized jobs like LSO, or the guy who talks to aircraft coming in for a carrier landing are one to two year assignments.

Do not fuck with our videogames. I think it's safe to say that the sharp rise in hatred aimed at jews is a direct result of that boiling rage at what they've done to our stories, our culture. Attacking our culture in this way is unforgiveable and I like many others, crave a vicious sort of revenge to repay Larry Fink for his hubris.

Sequels always get attention and woke dei stuff added now if the original was a success.
It is like they get bombarded with requirements to include it all since the first one demonstrated there will be an audience.
It also requires little imagination or creativity to simply piggyback woke crap on the already proven game formula.
Movies and tv shows have had the same thing for years.
If the first one does well but is made up of a normal demographic, the second will have prominent minority and lgbt stuff. The first one got pitched and was given creative license and gambled and won, but the second is based on a proven money maker and will not be allowed to proceed without the brainwashing.

Good point. In an age of advanced technology like this, most children will play video games at some point. It shouldn't become their entire world and that's up to the parents, but the parents don't have as much control if every single major game with a child or teen rating includes lesbian blue-haired feminists and blacks LARPing as Japanese warriors.

He's a puppet of China
who orchestrated the entire conflict, rigged a US election using a biological weapon they stole from US medical research lab, with the help of electronic voting machines built in a Chinese owned sweatshop inside a south American front company.
His neo-nazi battalions were funded by the Soros puppet group through Panamanian offshore banks paid for by chicoms.

Honestly CCP military strategy here is brilliant. They managed to collapse the entire western worlds economy, demoralize all their citizens, deplete their military munitions, drain their war chests, get hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers killed, take full control over the worlds military forces, and inject everyone with a virus they can use to kill the entire planet off with at will.

All while US military looks like full blown clown show with DEI pilots crashing planes, whole US transit system under constant attack, trains blowing up, ships crashing, they retreat from all strategic locations in middle east and Africa, lowest recruitment numbers on record and entire branches filled with mexican boyscots and women

Europeans have nothing left and their cops are being sliced up in the streets by deployments of weaponized migrants which was part of CCP UN plot

In addition, jewish central banking and money printing has enabled employment to be weaponized. Most jobs are complete and utter bullshit. No one needs a Director of Diversity & Inclusion, it clearly provides absolutely no benefit to the wagies while incurring costs to the company. So why do they do it? Because of printing at the Federal Reserve, which allows those who benefit from the money printing via cantillion effect, aka the jews in banks and jews in government, to incentivize backwards practices to raise their ESG score to qualify for some new grant.
Inflationary money printing also locks those wageslaves in, as every day their money is worth less than the day before. This encourages them to spend it and keep the rigged system afloat and those bullshit jobs going. If it's a race to be rid of your depreciating dollars, throwing $25 at McDonald's or $200 at Nikes looks more reasonable, so those companies end up being rewarded despite their bad business practices.
You'll notice silver stackers and crypto stackers NEVER want to actually spend from their stack, because they believe their form of money will always be valuable, if not increasingly valuable. Imagine if all money was the same way. Who would spend an ounce of silver on a Funko Pop or a couple hamburgers? No one, as frivolous spending is obviously detrimental. This would revamp the economy and bullshit practices would be forced to come to an end. Companies wouldn't waste real money paying for useless middle managers and DEI because they would no longer be competitive. And people would be up in arms seeing immigrants be handed the silver and gold they paid as taxes.
The root of all evil is jewish central banking. Nothing changes until it comes to an end.

So what they are doing now is quietly cancelling the entire game, take the millions of losses, fire more people maybe even drastically downsize Ubisoft while the CEO will pay himself a bonus and jump ship end of the year.

Brown GenZs are lazy and retarded and loud.
White GenZs are hard workers but have had their motivation crushed, leading to burnout.
The primary factors here are immigration of said lazy shitskins (who are unfirable, have almost no expectations, and make the same or more than the white workers picking up the slack), and central banking, which funds this mess by rewarding anti-white companies, paid for by inflationary money printing that once again, the whites are on the hook for.

Workers should never be lazy, there's a difference between lazy and unmotivated. Central banking is the root of immigration as well. Return to hard money and all the propped up scams like DEI/ESG/feminism/vapid consumerism disappear.

What >>482718174 said - hell, basic onboarding training hasn't been a thing for almost twenty years. Modern onboarding consists of a meeting where a couple of HR cunts talk about their DEI policies and their healthcare plan for sixty minutes and then fucking cut you loose.

I had a buddy who got hired for a general office job a few years ago. He got through an application, interview, onboarding, and two weeks of employment without any training or anyone even bothered explaining what the fuck his job was.

Employers basically assume you go into every job knowing every intricate detail of their culture and processes and that you'll just sort of sink or swim.

>It actually does matter a lot. Unless you are performing a task which does not involve any human interaction, which is unlikely as this jobs become more rare and are being replaced by machines. Being able to keep eye contact, having a proper posture and articulating your ideas, are very valuable tools in life. If you lack in one of those aspects, you will be precreived as deceptive or incompetent. Very few individuals can afford to ignore the ability for basic interaction, due to being overly competent in a certain skill. This is definetly extremely rare for young adults.

Except if you're still dealing with boomers or older Gen Xers in the workplace, they often shut your ideas down, or are on such a different spectrum and wavelength that you simply can't communicate with them.

A lot of stupid crusty old fucks don't realize that younger people realize the game is rigged. That things have changed. That their way of doing things is obsolete.

The lolbertarian idea of home based education is retarded. It's a natural response to the corruption of the current system, but it's still retarded. There should absolutely be national education standards, primary education should absolutely be taxpayer funded, this is basic stuff that any solvent state does and a well educated populace is a huge advantage in any kind of international affairs from military to economic competition.

My view is that libertarianism, along with half of right wing economic theory, is just a reaction to th government wasting money on niggers. This should piss you off, but just throwing the whole idea of statehood out the window over it is just as dumb as the DEI no child left behind shitshow we have now.

America is in such a sorry state that at this point Kamala seems the lesser evil than Trump. You get DEI with Kamala and she stabs you in the chest, but you get DEI with Trump as well just it's less in your face and the knife is in your back. But my biggest concern with Trump is that he's going to launch a war with Iran and Lebanon for Israel. We all know that MIGA will justify, excuse, or praise anything that Trump does, and if he actually started a war for Israel they'd be cheering it on. White military aged males cheering on a war with Iran because they love Trump -- what could be the consequences of that? If Kamala was president she wouldn't be able to rally anybody to war and they'd have huge problems with even keeping active military. It's just not feasible for Kamala to lead a major conflict and make no mistake that war with Iran would be a major conflict.

Iran is a country that's entirely mountain and one of the most geographically defensible countries in the world, has a shipping route through the Caspian Sea with Russia, has one of the best air defence capabilities in the world and is a top ten country in terms of military strength, and has spent decades hardening bombardment defences. It would be a meat grinding ground war and probably a worse slaughter than Ukraine.

I really am afraid of war with Iran happening.

>DEI hire may have a new perspective of running America
she doesn't, she has been running USA with biden for last 4 years. She represents nothing new whatsoever. Her changing anything is simply saying her and biden fucked up the last 4 years.
Think about this look at the US democrats since 2008, obama which fucked it all up, radical muslim from al ikhwan and a total anti euro shitbag.
What was that, obama and BIDEN VP, RIGHT?
then trumplet barely beat hillary.
Then it is' BIDEN AS POTUS, harris vp.
Now it's fucking HARRIS POTUS.
It's same fucking people, it's same fucking policies all the way back from obama in 2008.
LOL
direct chain, obama, biden, harris. HOW RIDICULOUS can it get at this point.
there's no change at all and trumptard is no change at all either, except he just trying to make being against immigration look retarded, he's not going to change that either only illegal immigration and then as many legals in.
Kamala harris wants ofcourse the illegals too.
There's no change AT ALL
LMAO for 16 years LMAO
Well except USA is going bankrupt cause of all this mass immigration is driving down wages and tax revenue, so it's -35 trill right now.
>add more, it's good for economy
it's literally proof that it isn't

Who cares. Mass effect Andromeda showed us bioware was dead back in 2017 and Anthem removed any doubt. I don't care what comes out of that studio. The mass effect trilogy were some of my favorite games of all time as well as KOTR and even so I was never going to buy it. Even then mass effect 3 wasn't what it could have been and the pozz was already creeping in in element of 2 with the DEI black caricature that was jacob. Most of that can be excused by losing some of the creative leads and the turmoil that put on development and it's mostly Andromeda that made them dead to me though. Regardless I had zero faith in that studio to lose.

I live in the the most right wing town in America, Trumpville (We changed our name to celebrate Trump's 2016 win) Nobody has ever voted for a Democrat in our town since its founding in 1828. In the 1944 presidential elections, "FDR's polio" won the popular vote, Hitler came in 2nd and Dewey in 3rd. When came back from a tour with the Army (Russian of coarse, I ain't serving in no DEI US Army) I was shocked to see Harris-Waltz signs in every yard. I asked my Dad, George Lincoln Rockwell III what happened. Now my dad's no namby pamby liberal, He works 18 hours in a coal mine and comes home to beat his wife every night. On his weekends if he's not at church he's out hunting baby seals with his whomping club. He said son, ever since Kamala took control, the economy has been fixed, we've not had a war and everything just runs right. Then the town mayor, Adolf Pinoche Babykiller popped by to let me know that he didn't leave the Republican party, it left him, Trump and plan 2025 were just too darn radical, JD Vance was Weird and January 6th was in fact both an insurrection and worse than 9/11. Then Donald Trump himself appeared and let me know even he was hoing to vote for Harris because she earned it and was a better choice and he would drop out but that "he legally still has to run" Then we all did Republican things together like saying the N word and guns. So if you are a Republican you should just stay home this year. If Trump can't even win his own vote we already lost

We Orthodox (one true faith as laid down by Jesus and his disciples, unchanged for 2000 years) bow in respect and fear to Mother Mary.
Mother Mary is our shield, she understands us, she is the Mother of God.

Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.
Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ, vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve. Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ, Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle. Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos misericordes oculos ad nos converte; Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui, nobis post hoc exsilium ostende. O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria.

Cuvine-se cu adevărat să te fericim, Născătoare de Dumnezeu, cea pururea fericită și prea nevinovată și Maica Dumnezeului nostru. Ceea ce ești mai cinstită decât heruvimii și mai mărită fără de asemănare decât serafimii, care fără stricăciune pe Dumnezeu Cuvântul ai născut, pe tine, cea cu adevărat Născătoare de Dumnezeu, te mărim.

They ruled it for college admissions, so the assumption is it also applies to job applications, army recruitment, etc. and if raised to the SCOTUS they would make the same ruling for the same reason, unless there's some specific new laws around this in the interim.
But as with all things it's a matter of "we'll keep violating the constitution until you take us all the way to the supreme court over it" (and even then they sometimes keep doing it anyway). Feds break the law all the time, but because they're the ones enforcing the law it's hard to get them to stop unless they do it willingly.
So yes, all DEI policies are obviously unconstitutional, but who's going to stop them?

I'll start. This is by far the worst case of DEI I've ever seen in my life. I've never really been involved in politics my whole life, and now Im so interested in following the current presidential election because of this baffling situation. Harris is so incompetent on so many levels that it's very bizarre how it's even a close race. What piqued my interest in this race is how far the leftist mainstream media is willing to go to push the narrative that Harris is a qualified and competent candidate. What's also puzzling is how so many people are falling for it, too, in this day and age, where information is readily available on the internet. You can just google how poorly she's performed if you look past the mainstream media and do some research on her performance.

Problem is that all industries, private and public have turned into female employment programmes. Dei and corp newspeak is literally written into the ts and conds of the loans they use to keep liquidity. So yeah, if you are a White human male in England, your options are self employed, physical graft making things for women and bames, or neet. I have chosen neet and not looking back.

Still would be going to work under angry and incompetent lesbian officers, black women officers, trannies, and fags. Still going to be sent to fight pointless forever wars that only make corporations, bloodthirsty neo-cons, and Israel happy. Still going to be sent to spread fag butt sex across the 3rd world and call it "democracy". Border is still wide open. Fentanyl zombies and homeless still choke the cities. Crime still goes unpunished to the point of anarcho-tyranny.

It's going to take at least 15 straight years of zero Woke shit, zero tolerance for illegals, zero tolerance for blatant criminality, 15 straight years of prosperity, and both major parties actively pandering to white people the same way they pander to every other group. I mean not just no obvious hatred of whites, I mean going out of their way to address our concerns and pander for our votes the same way they do now with blacks and gays and Hispanics and everyone else.

It's going to take all that and that long to begin to re-earn the trust the ruling class has squandered. You've shit all over us and everything we've cared about for almost 20 straight God damned years. It's going to take at least that long to make things right. Until then, this whole diseased, corrupt pile of shit can burn in the fires of its own creation. We and the world would be better for it.

Central and East Ukraine (crypto-Russians) were part of the Soviet Union
After the defeat of Germans, Commies under Hruchev miraculously pardoned all Banderists and even enacted affirmative action for "disadvantaged class" or the rural retards from West Ukraine, which led to west Ukrainians successively infiltrating Russian Kiev trough SOVIET-DEI and assuming total power in the 2000s

Taxation without representation is the main problem. Wagies slave away for 3-4 months every year to give the government money to pay for DEI programs, lgbtq shit, foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine, padding the pockets of corrupt politicians and paying NGOs that hate this country exorbitant amounts to flood us with unlimited illegals from 3rd world shitholes. Think about that: getting up, getting dressed, commuting, working 8-10 hours for 3-4 months straight just to pay fucking income tax to a government that hates you.

Nah, fuck that. Enjoy your slave job, though. I hope you sleep well at night knowing your taxes are paying for Israel's genocide campaign and the complete demographic change of this country.

This. People don't realize just how much damage a small group of guerilla fighters would be able to do to the United States. Or Canada for that matter. There is tons of space to hide and plenty of dense, populated areas.
Say you have three groups numbering three men each. As long as they are trained in hit-and-run tactics, building bombs, and firearms, they are pretty much unstoppable. The only way the feds will be able to do anything is if they can surround you.
Ambush tactics are key because feds and zogbots are not at all equipped to deal with them. I recommend everybody reads "The Brigade" by H.A. Covington because he outlines perfectly how one should operate cells of resistance to combat an incompetent, DEI-infested, overextended US government busy with wars overseas.
If you are White and give a shit about your future you have a duty to be armed, well-versed in guerilla tactics, and have extensive plans in place in case SHTF so you can inflict maximum damage in the shortest time possible. If you aren't doing these three things, you are not gonna be of much help.

Coloreds always serve and they want to fight, but they need white people to blame it on after the fact so they can keep fighting. It's hard to play the facism blame game when whitey isn't in charge. They also need more white people to blame for ship/ aircraft crashes.

*gives your hand a gentle squeeze*
Anon-senpai, if you're going to make the argument that the officials on the ground are eschewing telling the truth despite it being, politically speaking, in their best interests, you're going have to explain why.
To reiterate, the:
* Springfield Mayor
* Springfield City Manager
* Springfield PD
* Governor of Ohio
Have all come out and said these stories are unsubstantiated. All of these officials are Republicans or otherwise would be incentivized to back these claims. You're telling me the Springfield PD wouldn't be itching to back this? It's basically a free excuse for a budget increase.
To be clear, Springfield is in Clark County, which voted 60% for DJT in 2020. This isn't commiefornia we're talking about, this is MAGA territory.
If the narrative is true - that the radical woke DEI (Didn't Earn It!) Replacist Biden-Harris administration is busing 20K Haitian niggers who are a burden to the city's economy, infrastructure, and are sucking up jobs and welfare and EATING pets - then these are the people you would expect to be screaming that from the rooftops.
But they're not. Interesting.
If you can explain why without resorting to (((mirthful businessmen))) that would be nice, thanks.

You know how Jews elevated Black people with the DEI stuff and then threw those Black people under the bus because those Black people wandered off their plantation?

I'm starting to wonder if populist movements should ditch Christianity for wandering off of our plantation. I'm sick of seeing "Christian" churches with rainbow flags and obviously-Jewish pastors pretending to be Christians.

Even if evangelicalism is going away, that leaves us with Catholics and progressive protestants, both of which are also owned by Jews.

I really hate to say that populism needs a divorce from Christianity, but I think it should be done as a precautionary measure, at least in the short term.

It's a cycle. First decent indigenous English males get replaced and forced out of work. So they go on uni credit so they don't starve, and do the work coach meetings sending off applications and such. But the job centre roasties aren't happy unless they get a few hour doing some bullshit minimum wage humiliation job. They do that, get mugged off by every job recruiter because they aren't a dei, but still have to go to the job centre every week and get brow beaten about finding more work. Every week it's the same and they look around them and see people who don't work and don't get spoken to like their a teenager whose never worked before, and they think
>fuck it. I can have methol elves too
And so it continues. The increase over 3 years is the time it takes for them to get realise this and then get processed.

If you are a White male with a time served career in Britain today, and you get laid off, basically you're fucked. Check out jewtube, it's full of boomers making shitty blog style laments about what lifes like since they got laid off; millions of them.

You post a good answer but I'll do you one better and name the specific jew. Larry Fink. All of the DEI investment is Larry Fink's ideology. He chose to ruin every form of entertainment because he believes white people are racist and he wants to force diversity on the racist whites. Now for obvious reasons this made white people who weren't even racist to begin with into rabid antisemites. If you fuck with our videogames we WILL demand your extermination in a violent purge. Do not fuck with our videogames. I think it's safe to say that the sharp rise in hatred aimed at jews is a direct result of that boiling rage at what they've done to our stories, our culture. Attacking our culture in this way is unforgiveable and I like many others, crave a vicious sort of revenge to repay Larry Fink for his hubris. I'll wage an aggressive economic war against Larry Fink because of this and so should you. We should all be at war with Larry Fink.

The competency and work output of coomers is way better than the any US DEI corporation.
So the more explicit pornographic models made by degenerate furries end up being superior in every way.

I have taken a part time job at a shipping facility while I finish my masters degree.
During the days when we were doing new employee training, I was literally the only White person in my class and only 4 of 11 of the people in the class even spoke English.

Once we were sent to work I was assigned to the truck loading bay where we figure out how to fit all of the packages into the trucks. This isn't terribly complicated but it does require you to be a shape rotator and able to memorize and recall numbers quickly. I noticed that I was surrounded entirely by White people despite the day before being surrounded by browns and wondering if I had made a mistake.

Have I stumbled upon the origin of the "racist" working class White man? Were they the canaries in the coal mine who were trying to tell us that non-Whites are not like us? They literally can't do anything that requires thinking.
It's the most racially segregated place I have ever been. My previous jobs have all been White collar computer jobs where we had racial sensitivity training and DEI and blacks were given jobs for free.

no, its perfectly legal to have a white-only or black-only business. It's perfectly legal not to hire Republicans. What is not legal is opening a job to the public and having implicit or implied bias in hiring (no matter the race). This is why jobs collect x amount of applications within zipcodes and hold on file. So they can prove they have abided by each candidate's civil rights. DEI is another level altogether in the implementation of this. Its more a free speech violation then anything

America is an invidualistic society that would lead towards the notion of meritocracy determines fate. However, that becomes literally illegal in America due to civil rights laws. There will undeniably, without any deviation from this fact, that nonwhites, particularly blacks, will be given opportunities at the expense of whites (hence media being the outlet for this topic). This is a layered topic that deserves nuance, but ultimately any further regulations adding towards the complex nature of American civil rights laws only accomplishes short term changes. All of those non white covid jobs are gone. This is all without mentioning going into student loan debt for the country to outsource wages on the penny. Large media corporations, especially films that accept DEI investment will have the loudest opponents. No one cares they blacked Ariel, its everything on top of it that sets it over the edge

All of the profits from entertainment and salaries to entertainers should be taxed, even retroactively.

Because it'd look incredibly fucking stupid to put in a token. Besides Oppenheimer helping to create the nuke which killed tens of thousands of Orientals isn't something DEI wants to touch and just let whitey get all the blame.

You know, I just saw Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World. They had a black sailor here and there amongst the crew which is historically accurate as the Royal Navy didn't give a shit about race so long as you were able-bodied and could perform seamanship. Hence why they impressed American sailors in their desperate need to man their navy. There's even a mulatto captain in the late 1700's (who also owned slaves in Jamaica) serving the Royal Navy.

I'm all for historical accuracy. Even Flags of our Fathers showed a brief glimpse of some black GIs in the background which is accurate. Just don't put in a character that makes no fucking sense.

This even applies to white people in foreign settings. I never liked Shogun. Never saw the new mini-series but I did read the book and watched the 80's production. Blackthorne kinda sucks as a lead and he isn't even Mighty Whitey. Dirk Struan or Ian Dunross in Tai-pan and Noble House are far more Chad white protagonists than the Englishman trying to emulate Will Adams.

One other point I forgot to add, directly relevant to this thread: the reason people are now raising flags earlier (e.g. when pronoun crap gets added) is because the trajectory is obvious. The studio developing the IP has signaled that they are now on course to turn the franchise into completely retarded faggot shit for nobody. The release of a good game with a small injection of DEI-slop creates a feedback loop, wherein solipsist marketing retards (women and such) attribute the success to the new "features." The nautral conclusion of this is inevitable.

It's like they don't understand anything outside of binary (kek) thought. Gamers will only tolerate DEI-slop so much as they can ignore it in a game. If a game is good and it's nothing but pronouns or type A/B body, sure, whatever. Laughs will be had at the retardation, but the game will probably still succeed. But when it because a facet of the game that cannot be ignored? It's over. Games like Concord and Dustborn were utterly fucked regardless of their core gameplay mechanics. They developers would have seen more success releasing the game with no story and wireframe models. Nobody wants that trash, not even the people that make it or the retards that purportedly support it.

Corporations, especially in the videogame industry, who hire women are retarded. Really anyone who is choosing DEI over merit is an idiot by default. There are no real capitalists today or they would be taking over these feminized companies for pennies on the dollar and finding ways to get all the women out- Or maybe they have all just realized that women and feminism have destroyed these companies and they arent worth trying to save when there are better opportunities elsewhere.

No surprises, the shitshow that was Mass Effect Andromeda was 7 years ago now and the dei faggoty in the industry wasn't even so advanced back then. Its become clear that even way back in 2012 mass effect 3 with all it's significant flaws only bearly managed to squeak out the pipine past most of the cancer and be as good as it was. Even then after the actual devs had done their work the company still managed to ruin it further by being the ones who first really introduced the absolute AIDS that is lootboxes with mass effect 3s multiplayer. Bioware is dead, has been long dead, and remains dead. Hopefully Exodus is a worthy spirtual mass effect successor with a lot of the big names from the old crew working on it but with the absolute state of the industry I'm not holding my breath.

it specifically says if you know nothing about symptoms meaning you are testing a totally random person. If the test comes back positive the chances are 95% that they have it (regardless of what number of 1000 people they are) and 5% that the test was bogged. You would repeat the test to confirm.

Op is fucking with you guys. Its very simple. 95% of the time that this test comes back positive, it means you have the disease. 5% of the time it comes back positive and it means you dont have the disease. If you gave 100 people this test and none of them had the disease, the test would incorrectly show positive for 5 people. The other 95 people would show negative. If you gave 100 random people the test, it would show negative for all of them unless they had the disease, except for 5% who get a false positive.

The question is confusing because it makes you think that of the 95% that dont get a false positive, what liklihod is it that one of them is a 1/1000. But the test says nothing about false negatives or negative test rates so you just have to go off of the fact that 95% of the time, the test accurately will show someone has the disease and 5% of the time it will be incorrect.

As another example. Jews are 2% of the population. A dna test detects jewish dna accurately 95% of the time. The other 5% of the time it will say you are jewish if you are not. If you test 100% of the population, 2% of that population will show jewish dna 100% of the times they take a test. There is no false negative discussed. When testing the remaining 98% the population, 5% of the time those non jews will test incorrectly as jewish.

If you test any group, the test will accurately test positive for the cohort 95% of the time and inaccurately for 5% of the time.

Test makers are dei and retarded.

ya, it's already happening but the solution is just to overwork the few remaining whites in these companies. Once the whites quit or get fired due to DEI initiatives, it all comes crumbling down immediately.

To give you an idea of how ridiculous it's getting, I worked for a top tier tech company last year. One day, I walked in and there was a dindu with his pants around his ankle and reeked of pot. At first I thought it was a homeless guy who had broken into the building, but he was a new engineer they just hired. Apparently he was a convicted felon, and it was a part of some "ban the box" DEI initiative of hiring criminals they're now doing.

Basically, if you are a black felon you now officially have a better chance at being hired at a major tech company than simply being white.

Junior in EE can confirm, although I'd say more like 70% of the coursework is bullshit.The first 2 years you should be at a community college anyways. 1/4 the price and 1/2 the effort. Just focus on the math and thermo and you'll be good to go for uni. It's better if you do online schooling because you can let chatGPT get you like 70% of the grade in all your lower level classes like english or econ. You can straight up fail the proctored exams and still get a C. Definitely stay studied up on the maths though because once you get to uni it's like drinking from a firehose. Now with all the free time you have from letting AI do your bullshit coursework you can focus on relevant skills such as becoming a FORTRAN/C++ god, building your network, working out, learning a second language, actually implementing learned concepts in to DIY projects that you document and put on YT for extra bread and experience, etc etc.

If you're a man who is on the fence about higher education, I recommend you enroll for next spring now (Assuming our country doesnt split in to two factions here soon), because by the time societal incompetency becomes a SHTF scenario, and major institutions and firms start rolling back DEI policy (as some already are) in favor of people who actually know what the fuck they're doing, you'll be a prime candidate. Bonus points if you're white, speak english natively, and aren't an awkward social fuck with no soft skills.At worst, you take on about $40-50k worth of debt to have paid for the tuition necessary to regiment your lazy ass in to someone who knows how to engineer and build quality shit. This can translate in to being able to homeschool your children more effectively, or being chosen for better non-related jobs in general. For example, my buddy works construction, but he is in management while the rest of the dope smokers are still laboring because he has a bachelors in history. A degree is only as useless as your ability to market yourself.

And, thus, Osgood Perkins was born.

I’ll break it down. Basically all this identity politics stuff came about during Occupy Wallstreet. Wealthy executives were seeing the left and right unite against corporations. It was dangerous for their bottom line. This is why they pushed identity politics. Identity politics have no real effect on fiscal policy. The wealthy get to keep their money and the poors get to fight over whether they think trannies are good or bad. The poors believe this fight matters, so they don’t bother with the real issue at hand. This ties in to BlackRock. Blackrock has their fingers in every pie. They’re invested into pretty much every major corporation you know. Same goes for Vanguard and State Street. The push for DEI in the workspace is primarily a union busting technique. If everyone in the warehouse is racist, you aren’t getting mad at the boss, you’re getting mad at the coworker. As far as Hollywood goes, it’s done for agitation. The writers on most contemporary projects are the nepotism children of the wealthy. They have no real sense of how to critique capital because they themselves benefit from the system. So instead they push identity politics because it eases their conscience because they believe it’s something that actually matters. Then you have the stuff like gingers being cast as black, and Arabs being cast as Indians. These are related to zionism since both groups generally hate Israel. When it comes to attractive women in games, it’s much the same as the writers in Hollywood. They are either ignorant of or unwilling to critique the system as a whole, so putting an ugly woman in a game to them is peak political praxis. The thing is, the whole thing is inevitably self defeating. Like it or not, the reason most people hate trannies isn’t for any real ideological reason. They just think they’re fucking cross and ugly. That creates a market for making people not look as gross and ugly..

Not a conspiracy, they're pretty up front and honest about it, although it's died off (for now). They were offering investment funds to publishers / developers based off of how much globohomo shit they put into the games and how many non-whites and turd punchers they hired. They've stopped the funding for now cause it was catching a lot of bad PR and the games were all flopping, but they're just waiting for the heat to die down and rebranding the catchphrase they use (ESG became DEI, which has now become IG "inclusive Growth") before starting up again
