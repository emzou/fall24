It's kind of surreal how western leaders and governments have the audacity to think of themselves as the good guys while they deliberately disenfranchise the people they were elected to serve by turning their countries into economic zones which erodes the meaning of its citizenship. Oh, but see, that's the thing, according to western liberalism, it's a sin to value one's people, *IF* they're white. DEI is the West's new religion.

they do, and "filtering, maybe" is an answer that makes me think you're a shill, are you a shill? because the only answer to why there would be actively anti white policies in every aspect of life at a governmental level would be that said government hates white people and wants them to do badly and preferably die, and that government is disproportionately controlled by jews, blackrock owns all the money and larry fink, the face of DEI and a jew, owns blackrock and that's one of 5 million examples
there are movements and there are actions, the best action we can take and the one I've taken is to have a family, children, land, and the ability to defend those things, we have a demographic problem and the way you solve a demographic problem is improving demographics
you don't defend my family, or my things, we're white, you defend a government that would like to take all those things away and probably kill us
jews do control our governments and societies, and you serve them!

Catholics believe in Just War theory and in not only appropriate self defence but the defence of others as well.
Vocationalism is accepted by both the Catholics and most protestants, meaning you are allowed to fulfill your social role even if it includes violence (like being a police officer, a soldier, a father)
However this does not prelude gross actions of sin (slaughtering innocents because “orders”)

Holy War is internal and external and it is absolutely physical.
This is why Opus Dei practice self mortification.

1: Any form of "permanent" tech (medical or otherwise) with an external port has a 100% chance of becoming infected.

2: The tech will eventually begin to break down due to the electrical and pH differences between the tech and the brain, depositing heavy metals/micro plastics/chemical toxins inside your brain.

3: No guarantee what the thing they're putting in your head is capable of, or even if it will do what they promised. Case in point, Covid Vax.

4: There is currently no benifit to be derived from plugging your brain into a machine that still can't be secured to keep your personal information safe, much less your physical being.

All in all, the risk isn't worth the reward.

In three days I'm supposed to attend a DEI session organised by our new HR department.
I've heard through the grapevine that many of its members are blue hair dipshits that want to introduce faggots, niggers and trannies into our institution. They tried on others in the past.
What are some sources that can corroborate picrel?

There is no country to fight for. The ears in the last 40 years have all been Israel's wars.

I know they have you chucklefucks by the balls because they bribe, corrupt, and blackmail your leaders. I know their intelligence agency is intertwined with ours. I know that their software is rooted in everything defense related and so are the contractors. The golems are aware that all the wars serve the greater Israel zionist movement.

Look, we're just not going to do it, okay? We aren't going to die for Israel, nor for a country that hates white men, family, liberty, and equality.

You of course I encourage to go die beside your DEI buddy.

It's too bad the game is chink asset flip tier. Otherwise it'd bring a tier to my eye.

Anyway generally speaking, the rise of consoles, especially Xbox/ps2 era, was when this got too big and gay. I would say like 2002 was the transition year and almost everything after 2004 has that shitty stench attached to it. There are some exceptionsz and good games come out all the time still, but mostly just indies / handful of white guys or japs making something cool.

Banks have nothing to do with monetary policy. Banks have nothing to do with money supply. Banks have nothing to do with insidious lending practices that private equity pursue in the name of ESG and DEI. These are all policies explicitly pushed by jews who are an insidious cultural force eeking their way into private business through usury and confiscation. When was the last time you heard Wells Fargo doing this? When was the last time you heard PNC doing this? You don't. Because they are culturally agnostic entities. Jews do not behave this way.

Social media content selection algorithms need to he open source otherwise they could literally be easily reprogramming people’s minds.

Facebook did an experiment years ago that found increased suicide rates in target areas by 30%+ using change in selecting negative content to show users. Now imagine current board parameters for DEI priorities this means they will be actively selecting content to show users that promotes “diversity” e.g. by showing gay, trans, and interracial content at a much higher rate than reality which then popularises that behaviour to more impressionable e.g. lower iq children and equally sets off a proportional disgust response among the higher iq or higher status etc resulting in major civil unrest

Its time for our superior black brothers to more efficiently service our jewish overlords while our former white nation continues to remove competence and ability from its ranks.

Any opinion about how this is racist and evil needs to immediately report to your nearest DEI training center and begin deprogramming from your vile white nationalist beliefs. Thinking whites are going to carry you thru to the finish line and save your nigger and spic asses needs to be corrected addressed. This is your nation now soldier. Die for israel and DEI.

Not in combat rates. If you have a degree, are smart enough to stand out amongst DEI hires and maybe just can't find a foot in the door into your profession (STEM especially) - the military is a great idea. I'm nearing the end of my four years and I saved every dollar I could (will leave with close to 120k liquid), have a security clearance that will enable me cozy private DoD contractor work alongside four years of experience. All you have to do is keep a low profile where it counts and big daddy government can pay off in the long run, you're going to have to work alongside fags and niggers in the civilian world anyway, might as well make big daddy government pay for the ride. If you can only qualify for retard rates not worth it.

giving degree's to retards that follow HR directives because that is 'how its done' and also giving to subhumans allows HR to hire only those with a degree since they are qualified on paper and not hire valid and worthwhile whites that can be trained up and paid as is their due.

Its just another diversity DEI incident program. Nothing more than a way to further push white genocide in white nations. No subhuman/woman/cuckcoward with a degree is worth more than the most retarded white ditch digger with potato syndrome.

Women are dumb, narcissistic sheep. They'll do whatever dumb shit the herd does. Amplified in Hollywood.
They'll aimless drive to follow the latest fashion even when it is detrimental to themselves (as seen here).

Two major trends at the moment in hollywood.

First is that the average girls and women are getting uglier in film.
jew driven DEI is putting objectively uglier women into leading roles
the modern sjw female brain cannot cope with feminine beauty and the cognitive dissonance it causes

Second is the jew led niggerfication of media
In hollywood they only want nigger women, and non-blacks who cosplay as ghetto niggers
notice how these female stars talk like niggers, dress like niggers, makeup like niggers, nails like niggers... and so on

If you look at OPs pic this is all the result of an impressionable female brain being force fed a hollywood kike diet of DEI.
She likely noticed she was different, but incorrectly assumed that it was her fault
As she slid closer to the filmjew's image of amerimutt wigger she was probably reinforced with 'yass queen'
She now feels one of the flock. The feminine brain feels comfortable as she sips on her Stanley cup.

Started college at a state school in 2016 for engineering. Dropped out semester before covid hit because I was falling behind on my classes and it was getting really damn expensive. Too much partying, couldn't figure out how to execute and stay on top of my shit. Also not enough networking/study friends, felt too much like a small fish in a big pond.

Fast forward to today. I work two okay-ish wagie jobs, go to class part-time at a different state school. Grades are great, money situation is tough however. Loan repayments stopped being deferred have been kicking my ass as they're 10 yr terms and 1000+/month. When spring is done I only have 4 classes to go, and I've put out a shitton of applications to try and get an internship/full employment.

If you're thinking about college for STEM, here's a few pointers:
>You don't need college if you have a plan, you're willing to work hard, and know how to build/have a network.
>College isn't just grades; your profs probably do research. Talk to them. Ask to participate in their work. Get recommendation letters.
>It's damn expensive. If you're not on the DEI spectrum don't expect free money/grants to be given to you. Apply apply apply.
>Form study groups. You can do everything yourself but it's way harder.
>If you finish your first year with shit grades don't expect them to just get better.
>Summer classes aren't only for the people who flunked, use them to get ahead and lighten your courseload in fall/spring

It's shockingly rare to find companies that care about results, two decades of bailouts and DEI have removed pretty much all profit seeking and goal oriented behaviors from middle management.

Same reason people like doing it, because it is in fact easier to get away with doing less work and not dealing with all the crap in the office. Don't deny it. People have been finding and sharing ways to falsify productivity automating mouse movment and keystrokes and stuff like that from home for years now. You know theres some truth there. I get it. It's is nice avoiding so much of corprate bullshit and corprate is in fact a bunch of bullshit. It's obvious why people want it, it's a pretty cushy position to be in as an employee. Simultaneously there's some truth about productivity, cooperation, and coordination and is equally obvious why bosses don't want it. Not everyone is trying to take advantage but many work is just a paycheck so if they're not in danger of losing the job or even just know replacing them would be more of a speedbump to the project than turning a blind eye they really do not care. That's a pretty reasonable additude since no one's obligated to like their job but so is wanting a system which is more productive for the company when a persons own job involves making the people working under them more productive ensuring they meet the deadlines and standards set by the higher ups. Some people are productive without having their boss breathing down their neck and can be given a task and figure it out communicating as needed, some people basically just consult and aren't involved enough to need to be there often, but not everybody is good at time management or is possesed of a strong drive for self motivated behavior especially if they don't like their job. Work from home has a place in the modern work environment but it needs to be merit based with the sorts of tasks at hand also being taken into consideration, not a given. With all the DEI bullshit do you really not see how this could present a problem going forward if it became the standard? Do you think shanequa gives two shits if she's still getting her check?

Block any anti-white laws, remove nigger privileges everywhere (DEI , diversity, affirmative action etc -all of this MUST GO).
Remove nigger specific word from all gov contractor forms, it is literally illegal to discriminate on race (giving black businesses gov contract just because they are black is LITERALLY ILLEGAL but US gov does it anyway).

>Capitalism is a Jewish game
No. Capitalism is a fundamentally White concept, because its underpinnings are rooted in English common law.
>If you want to win at it, you basically have te become as immoral as the Jew.
No. You win in the market by serving other people and their needs.
>That is, you have to normalise usury to enrich Jewish bankers even more, pay shit wages, treat your White employees as cattle, replace your White employees with alien cheap labor when you get the chance, press the government for more open borders when the wages you're paying are too good, etc.
No to all of these. Usury is the practice of unreasonably high interest rates on loans. You don't need usury, you need practical loans (or debt) for businesses to thrive. Usury itself isn't a normalized thing. In regards to wages, the issue with wages is a matter of currency devaluation from government central banking institutions which have a monetary policy based on an outdated economic theory (keynesianism). In regards to treating white employees as cattle, this is just a random accusation that can't be debated because there's no stat on "which corporation that is ONLY white is treated better or worse." if someone is treated bad long enough eventually they'll leave no matter what. In regards to replacing white employees with alien cheap labor, this is a consequence of government interference in the market AGAIN because of trade deals, DEI & ESG ordeals, and government sponsored leftist ideals in colleges promoting anti-white hatred. In regards to pressing the government for more open borders, this isn't the fault of capitalism or voluntary trade by any means, it's the radical "new left" from the 1960s.
>The average "conservative" might think 1930's Fascists (which he only knows on a surface level) were based
No, your average conservative doesn't think they were based. Also, while Hitler himself was verbally against Capitalism, the third reich barely reflected this verbosity.

Oh they still try to recruit, but they never evolved the recruitment tactics. Pretty much its always been a combination of patriotism and underclass marketed selfishness (ie: join and get college money, skills, etc).

The real problem is that patriotism is basically dead at this point, with War on Terror veterans actively telling their own children to not join the military. DEI and faggotry promotion gutted morale over these last 10 years, and the COVID nonsense was the final icing on that cake.

And what about the tried and true method of human selfishness? Tik-Tok ruined that. Now all the zoomers and Gen alpha types get first hand accounts of how shitty the benefits actually are and how dumb and bureaucratic military life actually is.

Unless America actually becomes a country worth fighting for, military recruitment will never make up for it regardless of white papers.

They stopped trying to recruit. This white pepper should be mandatory reading for anyone talking about the state of the US military:
https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3240&context=parameters

Decades ago the military shifted its focus from large infantry and mobile units to high tech weaponry and more specialized ground forces. They could promote DEI nonsense to score political points because mass recruitment of regular soldiers wasn’t needed.

Things have come to a head, and now advanced weaponry has become so cheap that even no -state actors can afford it. The war in the Ukraine was the “inflection point” (again, so yourself a favor and read the link) proving that large infantry forces are once again required.

So the West is absolutely shitting its pants now, which is why there’s talk in the UK about a draft, reluctance to send troops to Yemen, the U.S. holding back Israel, and so on. Our armies have been built around a type of fighting that, in some ways, has ceased to exist.

Particularly for intelligence services truth and facts are vital to do the job properly. By purposefully alienating those who obsess over it, engage in DEI, and fire everyone who appreciates it. They have purged from themselves many of their compentent and future elites. Driving them straight into the arms of Anonymous. This is why Anonymous being the Best Intelligence Service on the Planet who is always ahead of schedule and underbudget should in fact be taken far more literally than what glowniggers and most anons realized.

Guess who the very first Turncoats were made up of? Ex Intelligence Operatives. Guess who provided them with a brand spanking new piece of undefeated and unstoppable means of bleeding edge advanced 4th Generation Warfare? The first turncoats were made up entirely of the absolute worst possible candidates they could have afforded to lose and the very best ones who just discovered their dream means of warfare handed to them on a silver platter as a sign up bonus. Those guys vanished fast and hard when they quickly realized what was up. Disappeared into Anonymous never to be seen again. They were merely the first wave.

In terms of the military...oh boy wait until you learn about how bad it is among the Intelligence Community. There is a reason why I am dropping a hot pile of shit on top of glownigger heads in these threads that will be forced to eat like a first class feast. People still think too much of 'muh military is fucked' but haven't yet realized the key informants and operatives were gutted long before that.

Ron DeSantis condemned as Florida removes sociology as core college class Anonymous ID:jjaBUOmT Sat 27 Jan 2024 22:00:59 No.456729402  Replies: 99 ViewReport
Educators are warning that college enrollment in Florida will plummet after the state removed sociology as a core class from campuses in the latest round of Ron DeSantis’s war on “woke ideology”.

The Republican governor’s hand-picked board of education voted on Wednesday to replace the established course on the principles of sociology at its 12 public universities with its own US history curriculum, incorporating an “historically accurate account of America’s founding [and] the horrors of slavery”.

The board faced a backlash last summer for requiring public schools to teach that forced labor was beneficial to enslaved Black people because it taught them useful skills.

The removal as a required core course of sociology classes, which Florida education commissioner and staunch DeSantis acolyte Manny Díaz insisted without evidence had “been hijacked by leftwing activists”, follows several other recent “anti-woke” moves in education in Florida.

Related: Florida advances law banning children under 16 from using social media

They include the banning an advanced placement class in African American studies, and last week’s board ruling crystalizing a plan by DeSantis, who dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination over the weekend, to abolish diversity, enquiry and inclusion (DEI) programs in Florida’s universities and colleges.

The American Sociological Association said there was no evidentiary basis for replacing the sociology course.

Thanks to the spread of /pol/ materials. Suddenly for the first time ever Glowniggers found themselves the victims of their own inventions and kinds of warfare but this time utilized by a mysterious enemy who successfully managed to confirm the usage of a weapon that they knew naught how to counter despite it being over 10 years now of billions of dollars invested and millions of man hours to try.

However this also made them threat and required 24/7 mandetory monitoring which lead to the direct exposure that at times could be very dangerous. For those on the job weren't everyone who watched some began to do so for fun. Meanwhile identification of those compromised required them to be...honest. They knew what to say to avoid detection if if they so desired. So those turncoat numbers only grew and fresh meat was thrown into the grinder to add to their numbers or until they were transferred away.

Tell me glowniggers how long can you stand being here? Did they ever tell you what happened to your predecessors? Ever thought 'maybe these anons have a point about....' See that is the difference between you and a turncoat. A turncoat appreciates the truth and can do their job properly. See the problem there? A broken glownigger are immune but cannot do their job properly. Good thing about DEI helping disguise that huh? Oh about how can you tell the difference between incompetence and sabotage? OUCH. So much for finding all those turncoats eh?

This is a bad analogy and not what's going on. DEI is about Equity, which means equality of outcome. If there are limited amount of jobs in certain areas, and they want to give it to Include people they consider Diverse, which does exclude Jewish and Asian males too if you are one according to recent Harvard lawsuit, then you take away those opportunities from others they consider not Diverse.

DEI doesn't benefit Indians. The term "underrepresented groups" was invented to replace "minorities" just because they realized asians and Indians would have just filled all the quotas without handing out any gibs to blacks

I work on a team of mostly indians at an american tech company and honestly they're all right. There are incompetent ones and 2X ones, though I'd say all the 10X engineers I've encountered have been white.

DEI is already on its way out, the "news" has always been propaganda, but censorship is being scaled back somewhat, a lot of illegals will likely get deported and purges may happen.

The last rubbery orgasm of my worthless white life will be when young Black hands wrap around my old white turkey throat and choke me until I shit my pants.

You will all lose your women to great BBC migration
Love, love, love! A subtle, beautiful illustration of the New Black Order rising.

A beautiful young woman, standing euphoric with the powerful, dynamic Black man who is going to fuck her brains out.

Then the sexless white boys. Dejected, background boys, sexless, immature. They huddle alone like those beta orangutans who never evolve the hyper-masculine features of the alpha. These boys will never get a whiff of a pussy worth fucking, and they will likely toil their lives away for some haughty girlboss who's 100% dedicated to DEI and hating white supremacy, one little "right sizing" away from career death.
They will develop unhealthy addictions in their inceldom. If they don't drink or bake their brains on weed, they will fall down an abyss of porn addiction—perhaps they will join us in this very thread—wasting away in their gooncaves. A few will ultimately become trans women.

This shit is art.
The glaring, inevitable death of young whiteness. The obliteration of the West.
The glorious dominion of BBC.
The conversion of white women to breed Black.

We are only at the start of the new Black kingdom, my brothers. Please try to pace yourselves as you jerkoff to your slow-motion extinction. When Black power ends my life in 30-50 years, I want my brain to be a dopmaine-deprived walnut, crusty and damaged, destroyed by a lifetime of gooning to Black dick. The last rubbery orgasm of my worthless white life will be when young Black hands wrap around my old white turkey throat and choke me until I shit my pants.
I fucking pray to a nonexistent, dead white God that my last squirt of DMT dreams before oblivion will be Black men and their magnificent cocks. Then it's down, down into that eternal Black night we all return to.
Remember that even the end and eternal nonexistence after this fever dream of interracial fuckery called life is BLACK.

Right now yeah, but why do you think stealing people's property would be any better?

You're never going to organize a cohesive resistance on any scale.
Even if you do you'll never be able to keep it honest for any significant period of time.

The time is now for a decentralized distributed open global ledger that's secured by a put option on kWh. One that anybody can audit 24/7/365 for $150 in hardware and an internet connection
The game theory around Bitcoin is so much more significant because it incentivizes building out efficient electricity generation methods making kWh cheaper for everyone involved.
There's no fake ESG, DEI, it's all based on merit and rewards the individual who creates market efficiencies.

All the other ideas are stupid. Bitcoin wins.

There’s going to be more serious changes then trump winning for that to occur, for one all DEI will have to be stopped. The demonization of white men will have to be stopped. The gay rights and lgbtq shit will have to be put on a back burner at the very least.

And last but not least, they will have to do mass deportations, arrests, etc. The population will have to return to 80% white for literally any “enlistment” to occur. I’d rather rob and murder than die for Israel.

From my previous hobby of aviation simulation and watching tons of videos of people flying, I know that there are already tons of retarded niggers as air traffic controllers, and that it's been like this for a few years now. Flying in America is fundamentally less safe because of this fact, so this is a variable that we cannot control. However, we can avoid using certain airlines that hire niggers and women as pilots. Is there a way to know before paying for a flight who your pilots are going to be? We can collectively work together to make it less profitable for leftist airlines to practice DEI.

I've actually postulated this for a while.

2001 was the start of the decline as 9/11 entered us into the foreign war era which would basically turn most my generation into cannon fodder either for IED's or fentanyl, combined with the mass panic/anxiety immediately post 9/11 which was used to restrict our civil liberties.

BUT

for most people, day to day life in 2001 felt incredibly similar to life in 1999. Kids still played outside. Most parents were still married. Movies were still entertaining, a college degree was still worth getting. A working class family could buy a house. Etc.

2008 is when it all changed.

>Obama elected
>facebook went mainstream
>iphone introduced
>foreign wars still continuing
>stock market crash
>housing market crash
>OWS and Tea Party movements nerfed by identity politics to shift focus away from (((bankers)))
>DEI and LGBTQ bullshit starting to flood the colleges and corporations.
>Technology fundamentally shifted from complementing and improving the human experience to replacing it (fuck you, self checkout)
>gaming shifts from something you to with friends in person to something you sit alone doing
>movies and TV and music and games all now thoroughly pozzed with (((programming)))

2008 was the year we shifted from the real timeline to this shitty social-credit technofeudal hellscape.

I'd agree with the premise, both the 50's and 80's (and 90's to a degree) had an insane degree of cultural optimism. Which is someone of a contrast with the realities of the geo-political situation at the time. What made it bearable was the insanely good domestic social/political situations and the rapid advancement of technology that actually enriched the human condition.

I truly have considered writing a book on the contrasts between then and now and using it as a basis of a political movement.

Even the most obnoxious leftoid looks at Nostalgic pictures or videos of the 80's and talks about how great it was. They might not admit why it was great (because it wasn't their DEI-driven socialist utopia) but they'll still admit it was better and people were happier.

You fags are going to say "The Jews" or NWO or some bullshit, but the real reason is capitalism.

Corporations want more money, and to do that they need the country (countries) to grow. White people have gotten lazy. No one wants to be a farm hand, or work a bullshit service job, or work in some shitty ass factory anymore. So they bring in cheap labor from Latin America, or even cheaper labor from Africa or the Middle East to fill in the gaps.

On top of that, white people don't want to have kids anymore. Half of you all are faggots and will never bear children, the other half are too poor to afford more than 1 kid. And if you do have kids you won't encourage them to work a service job or learn a real trade, you're going to try to get them into Computer Science or some faggy shit that'll have no real value after the bombs drop.
Low birth rates = Immigration.

All of this shit happening today, DEI, immigration, etc. is all because of corporate greed and white people not having kids.

Why do you think airlines companies are expanding DEI programs? No it's not to uplift niggers, it's because white people are leaving that profession in droves. Why do you think there are so many black and latino semi truck drivers now?

Soon they too will be replaced by 3rd world cheap labor.

There's also stuff about classes for adults to learn to ski and some dumb shit about getting cripples on the slopes. I think part of it is they're desperate for more skiiers since the resorts are really expensive to run, but part of it is definitely stupid DEI pandering. They'd be much better off just advertising more, and setting up buses from the nearest big city out to the resorts. In Lake Tahoe, that would mean busses from Sacramento and SF, so that people who want to come up for the day but don't want to deal with tire chains can come and have a good day and not worry about driving. The Rockies would mean expanded busses from Denver. It's kind of a no brainer but Vail is run by idiots.

One of the biggest political blows to the left in recent history has been the association of DEI with antisemitism. This alone will probably take down the 80% Jew support for Democrats to much lower numbers in the next years. Most prominent example right now must be Bill Ackman, but there are hundreds of other high net worth Jews switching sides.

Your enemy aren't Jews, your enemy is the Left, you are just too stuck up in 20th century politics and a personality cult to understand that with a sober head.

Jews became left-leaning in western societies out of self defense, that is partly why they are actually far more right leaning in Israel, where they don't feel threatened by another holocaust.

If the far right moves in the direction of accepting and integrating with Jews that support our values, we will replace the center right and become far better positioned to usher a new renaissance for peoples of European descent.

Difference now is that they have no choice but to destroy the very core of the left. Wokeism has become a RELIGION, with its oppressor/opressed mentality. Jews can't revert that now even if they tried. And no, they can't single out themselves from DEI while still enforcing it, no matter how much they bribe their way into political and economic power, because DEI is now a grassroots leftist position. They are sandwitched between the antisemitic far right and the antisemitic far left. Whoever proves to them that they are safe will win the political landscape for years to come.

He vowed to destroy DEI because he deemed a certain university administrator to be to weak in her condemnation of Hamas.

He didn't care one bit before that.

Jews are not and will never be on our side. There is well-documented history, over centuries, of their parasitic and nefarious behavior.

>The artillery battalian alone has 100 MLRS and just as much modern howitzers. They have ammunition within the millions.
You're probably not going to have to use them as Russia is already having a hard time advancing against a single proxy state of people who are pretty much Russians anyways but armed with some NATO gear and money.

>If not for this reason, what reason would it need to send weapons?
The civilian politicians who sent that aid severely underestimated the Russians and had no idea how it was supposed to be used in the first place, so it trickled in. If the tanks had been supported by aircraft as they're supposed to be the spring offensive might not have been a total failure. Announcing it months in advance giving the Russians ample time to deploy vast minefields didn't help either.

nigs can't artificial intelligence, but whites and asians can. Goyim can't understand the most basic rules of life, and so slopping them with DEI is halarious, even using the government to enforce those things, doubly halarious.

Basically it's how Jews destroy their competition, by forcing them to uptake people who cannot maintain a company or a civilization at all. it's how Jews fight. It's a kind of Semitic version of a Civilization Jihad.

When men and women have adequate mating strategies, they put their focus on mating, and in so doing they become biologically satisfied. Or at least it keeps them busy.

But when mating strategies fail -- for a variety of social reasons, like now -- men become dangerous and women become batshit crazy and start defending DEI and open borders and anything else that increases the odds of women being around additional sperm.

What we think we see is Democrats versus Republicans. That's the downstream effect. But it's really a mating failure that turned Democrats into the woman party and Republicans into the man party.

>It's not "DEI"
I thought this is what you meant by 'normal' men using it to their advantage. Like you're in a corporate setting, 80 IQ shaniqua gets the promotion you wanted because there aren't enough black women in management or whatever so you become a tranny because there are no trannies in management either. Normal men don't troon out for a sense of community, are you insane??
>Something that is difficult to find as a man.
While this is true, cucking like that is not masculine. You can find other masculine men and create a friend group or community, what kind of solution is larping as a woman and hanging out with other larpers? They're all gonna be leftist faggots anyway.
>but we live in a terminally online society and autistic spergs aren't exactly going to fit in at a gym.
Imagine living in a world where people troon out rather than go to the gym, a world where trooning out is easier or makes more sense in some peoples' minds just to get that sense of community. Never would've thought this would happen ten years ago, man time flies and the jews have upped their game. I will never troon out or kms no matter how lonely I am.

Oh, come on, anon. 53 years is a long time. Even if they don't stop with the DEI bullshit, systems will eventually become safer for everyone. Shaniqua wants to be a pilot? Fine. There is now an annoying incredibly advanced autopilot that will constantly remind her of everything that is going on and make prognoses of potential problems and measures that should be taken to avoid issues. White and Asian nerds with 130+ IQs will always be around.

Normal men are using it to their advantage. It's not "DEI" but the community around it. Most of these men are lonely autistic losers. Trannies create spaces where these men have a place to belong. Something that is difficult to find as a man.

Obviously joining a gym or sports club would be superior, but we live in a terminally online society and autistic spergs aren't exactly going to fit in at a gym.

>Not with hormone blockers it won't.
As I said, that falls under a much larger umbrella. Hormone blockers are just the new antidepressant. The medical industry has been doing this for years forcing untested medication on minors. It honestly has little to do with trannies and more to do with the jewish medical industry.

If you mean because normal men will use it to their advantage, to benefit from DEI as if they still live in a meritocracy then sure, but a lot of 'men' troon out for reasons besides that, I don't think many 'troon' out for upward mobility.

Something I think is both hilarious and disgusting is how the political left and the liberal media sees gangs as "culture". They will NEVER call-out gang violence as the reprehensible and horrific behavior that it is because it goes against their stupid DEI pipe dream of everyone getting along.

It's also amazing that under liberal mayors, cities are literally in chaos because of gangs. Chicago's south side is the best example of this. They nicknamed it "Chiraq" because the statistic was that you were more likely to get shot on the streets of Chicago than you were if deployed to Iraq. Liberals will never learn.

TLDR (for both of my replies):
Gangs are a plague on every major American city, and are exclusively a black and Latino problem. POC need to go. Segregate NOW and stop miscegenation at all costs.

Based anon.

The culture wars stuff like DEI and ESL are pushed by Wall Street hedge funds, who are primarily owned by the 1% who are mostly Hayek worshipping right-wing neo-liberals. Actual leftists don't have access to anything close to that much money.

They push identity politics of race, gender, and sexuality, but one type of identity is mysteriously absent; class. That reveals who is behind it.

Strange how after Occupy Wall Street, Wall Street has been frantically pushing race, gender, and sex identity politics to push attention away from the huge transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich.

Push identity politics and annoy working class people (who quite rightly hate being told they are "privileged"), pushing them into the arms of right-wingers who then give more tax cuts to the rich (the money the rich gain does not go back into the economy, it goes to off-shore tax havens) causing the debt to soar which means the poor, working class, and middle class get fucked in the ass to pay for the tax cuts given to the rich.

Divide and Rule, the oldest trick in the book.

Competency Crisis. Boomers are largely retired. Gen X last generation to be unaffected by Affirmative Action. Gen X is the smallest in number and DEI is ensuring everybody else gets promoted over them(again). The closest thing they got to competency is the Mormons who also got buttfucked by DEI. Their lower and middle management is completely rotted. Their top is also rotting fast.

Second: the definition of "over" expands each day. If you have a job, send about 50 job applications as an experiment. See how many replies you get. DEI is slowly ensuring white people with a spotless resume are as hopeless as white people who haven't worked a day in their lives.

Dei.
Just because healesoney doesn't mean he is a benefit to society.
Nigger doctor that fucks up all the time is potentially an even larger drain to society.
These are the numbers with them in only some powerful positions.
Unfortunately, the more important roles we give them in society, the more likely they will have a deeper and deeper net negative draw.
Think about Boeing for example. You take a white with a $200 positive and make him negative by replacing him with a nigger who doesn't even do his job.
Plane crashes and causes $200m in damage + loss of the majority white flying customers each worth $200k...
I predict these numbers will only get worse over time.ddyya

Literally the only reason this scares me is because DEI activists say that objective testing and evaluation of someone's competence is racist. I don't even think black people are less intelligent or capable than people of any other race, but when you've deliberately lowered the bar for one group, it's completely logical to assume that the average performance of people from that cohort is going to be inferior to those who were held to a higher standard.

Based digits thread. It was a power play by the DEI ESG globalist cabal to thwart populism. Not that Trump cares a whit for the comman folks but he was not supposed to run. He was supposed to donate money. They can’t have someone they can’t control on high office, even if all he does is rage post on Twitter from his tacky gold plated toilet. All that horror and madness was to make sure the president is an empty suit sock puppet like Romney, Kerry or Biden.

1. No, it’s a trust, funded by my dead grandparents. What’s fucked is my dad is the beneficiary and controller of a GST Exempt Trust set up by his own mother, so he decides how the proceeds get distributed (to him) even though it’s a Generation Skipping Trust. Go figure.
2. There is no possible way for me to ever surpass my father in terms of lifetime career income because I was not prepared correctly for this society and the demographics and global economic system has changed so much. Why the fuck would I bust my ass so hard for $100k let alone $25/hr when my parents made $32/hr in 2023 dollars at their first part time job with no college education?

The cost of working outweighs the cost of not working, at least for middle class white males. So if you want us back, you have to make it worthwhile or I’ll just continue to suck the fatted teet. I have a feeling white males in general are too rational for the shitskin government DEI hires to anticipate with their models. So now we’re stuck in an inescapable hole where shitskins aren’t capable of stepping up to take care of civilization yet and white males are too demoralized and underfunded to give a fuck about keeping the machine running

Nice strawman, faggot. The issue is that average, functional dudes with proper hygeine are not valued by society. They work and do their best. Yet they are passed over by women and unable to get married. Their struggles are made fun of, and they are punished at every turn by DEI, feminism, and court systems heavily skewed against fathers. The juice is quickly becoming not worth the squeeze to them, which is why men are dropping out and refusing to be as productive as possible. This is leading to the looming competency crisis and ultimately collapse of stable society. Trying to shift the focus to subhuman losers is disingenuous at best and greatly understates the gravity of the issue.

because of extreme taxation and over-regulation, people find it easier to live in the streets than pay for a house, car, phone, ect..

Everytime the Establishment chimes 'The Rich Isnt Paying Enough' the taxes on the middle class go up.

Everytime someone stubs thier toe and it makes the news, some legislator passed more regulations 'to prevent' the issue, but all it does is create/extend more government beauocracies & government jobs. With more government jobs comes more government managers to supervise those government jobs. those new jobs need more offices. they need more furnitiure, they need more DEI oversight..

Point being, the problem is the Government yanking more & more money out of your pocket thru taxes. Most of with is hidden thru products, oversight, and purchases. The money you pay for a gallon gasoline is tax revenue, for example.

The most successful business in the country for the past 50+ years is government

Sounds like he's gaslighting you into giving him grandkids. There's no context clues as to why he would say you're filled with anger. Do you have random outbursts about injustice?

I'm in a very similar boat to you, even down to the cars, height, and engineering school. I'm 6 years older so I did start late on college, but other than that we're in similar situations. Why shouldn't you be angry as injustice? If you graduate top of your class and get passed up for good engineering jobs because of DEI you have every right to be pissed. I don't really have any advice to stop from being angry, because anger is a natural, logical response to many things going on right now.

The only thing I can say is that you can't let it take over your entire personality, you can't show anger constantly because then no one will want to be around you. It doesn't sound like this is a problem though. So unless you're leaving out some big stuff I don't really think you have a problem. You're dad's advice is either outdated or it's nonsense with an agenda. At any rate, I hope you get what you want in life anon, good luck to you.

The main idea of modern quality control isn't to raise quality, but to achieve the quality usually produced by qualified, white workers with niggers and retards.
It's cheaper to spend your money on responsible and qualified workers than to check on everything the DEI niggers do.

>Alabama's federal aid accounts for 41% of their state revenue.

You're just posting a number though which doesn't answer what I'm asking. What are they actually spending that Federal money on? Like for instance if they are spending it on education etc., once they have told the Fed to fuck off, they can just say "we're not doing X education anymore, we're doing Y instead". Like DEI shit, that's a very small percentage of spending, but just as an example, so
lets say:
>Alabama says "we're not complying"
>Fed says "we're taking away your Federal funding for Education DEI"
>Alabama just responds by cutting their DEI program from their education

What programs would be harder for the Fed to deny to a rogue state because they need the state to do it. So lets say the state stops complying, but they Fed can't really stop giving the state money for certain roads, because those roads are needed for the DOD to have access to the missile silos. So the state still is completely allowing the DOD to use that, they just aren't complying with Federal agencies they deem unworthy, like FBI or DHS or Border Patrol etc. They are doing their own stuff on that regard.

Break down this gambit for me if u could.

>I don’t think an actual civil war or anything close to it has any chance of happening, but the pretext of an impending civil war could be used by the feds to justify a lot of things to the general public that they normally wouldn’t be able to justify. It could also be used to bait conservatives into making mistakes they normally wouldn’t make. The powers at be could totally annihilate the American Right, without any organized opposition, right now. Never kid yourself into thinking that they couldn’t do it just because everything is a DEI clown show today.
i agree with a caveat: while the liberals are true believers, the vast majority of people implementing and upholding the processes for this bullshit are apathetic losers "just following orders" or "doing their jobs." the dissonance between their job and their personal values doesn't come up much (because they're either apathetic, have no views on anything, or are fucking retarded) - when it does, you get scenarios like the handful of capitol police who killed themselves after j6. they didn't for a second believe they'd be the forces against americans

the feds will annihilate the right if they had the will for it, but i don't see that the will is based on true believing of this nonsense - if it were, the right would already be annihilated. they will do it if they feel threatened in their stability to keep drawing taxpayer money and play princess in washington and feel sophisticated for it
this is why j6ers get massively punished - they made the nobility feel not just scared, but *stupid,* and that's the biggest sin of all. most vitriol against trump is not based on his policies or views, but that his win in 2016 made them feel stupid and they want blood for that
but texas being anti-immigrant? that makes them feel smug - look at those chuds thinking they matter! that's why it's more likely they'll just do nothing except electioneer off of it

Things started moving in the wrong direction under Clinton, and accelerated under Obama. There was an over emphasize on civilian education to the point that we stopped making a serious academic study of war. The top ranks of the DoD are basically now academicians. Effectively, the DoD is being run by that facility lounge of Harvard. We are essentially incapable of winning another war. Pic related is the top Army Armor Officer. Everything is run through the DEI lens first. I remember counselling Soldiers where I had to make sure I always had one member of each ethnic group in the room with me to observe the session. Combat Arms is less fucked than the rest of the Army but most of the Army (90%) is made up of support personnel who are essentially redditors.

(demand for labor would also shift because more people = more mouths to feed, more consumption, etc.)
the problem of immigration is not something that can be described in purely economic terms because pure economics doesn't really care about whether society is a slum or not. let's use the favorite example of japan: by economic numbers, japan is worse than the US: lower GDP, even lower per capita. but japan's social is not facing similar issues as the US does. the economic numbers do not measure that, and only when you start introducing arbitrary "quality" judgments do they show anything (which works the conclusion into the premise, and so you don't need an economic argument, like gaymo's michelin stars thing). the closest you can get is "income disparity" but that in itself isn't indicative of much and is often used to argue socialist tripe about le capitalism
there's crime rates, but then we aren't talking about economics anymore - that would again be introducing a qualitative judgment, and one that is easily gamed (like decriminalizing)

economics does not have an opinion on what is measured as economics. the negress hired as part of DEI initiatives to lecture white workers on why they are racist is measured as economic productivity. what is considered "profitable" or worth doing is a social judgment, all societies have designated sacrifice (whether it be religious ceremonies, war, scientific pursuits without profit, or ethical demands like modern "progressivism") and economics does not care - see bataille's works on the subject. excess value is expended towards a society's methods for it, even if catastrophic

here is the best economic argument against immigration: the aliens want what you have, even if they have to take it from you. it's that simple. it does not require any charts or "objective" rationales that explain the problem in abstracted, quantitative terms. you can go ahead and do that, but it's making the problem harder than it really is

You're witnessing the gop making an executive decision to cut off the attacks on Trump by neocons as to not weaken themselves. Haley and her backers if left unchecked could split the party. These neocons need to be forced to openly admit they will be voting for the Democrats. Looks like gop got the go ahead to win next election. They've stripped the country to the bone, got most of what they wanted, wars, immigration, expansion of DEI. The system now needs to get back into a fiscally responsible situation and they will use Trump as the Paschal lamb to implement the harsh measures need to do that. Deregulation, cutting it social programs, the harsh reality of seeing deportations on tv.

This is only a little of what faces Trump, 4 years is no where enough time to wheel back the extremes to which the world has been pushed. Trumps perhaps biggest hurdle will be foreign policy, they've left a Gordian knot for the poor guy to figure out.

They will frame Russia as the enemy as it's a longstanding meme. Easy war drum to bang.
It's easy to portray the Russians as an evil hoard and there's not enough personal UK-Russia connections for the average person to feel cognitive dissonance about it.
The Ukraine war is because of a US led coup. Any moron can see it.
Russia has no ambition or capability to set foot on actual western soil.
They are simply dealing with border issues and defense due to US interference.
NATO has no intention of ever putting boots on the ground (outside some SF / intelligence input).
The US was machine simply provides the tools not the meat.

So why all the Russia demonising and war drum beating in the news?
Why all the bias demonising nonsense articles?
They want money and men to sacrifice for US led bullshit in the middle east
Got to keep that trade flowing for their jewish masters.
They're worried Yemen will be Iraq 2.0 and they're suddenly realising that all their DEI efforts to recruit mentally ill trans people who can't fight is an issue
They're desperate to roll back the updates to Grunt version 1.0

They also want to deflect attention from the real issue in the West....
Look! Russians are the bad guys! No, not the hoards of niggers flooding into the West and destroying the fabric of western society
Don't notice those lovely, peaceful immigrants. They're here to make your life better.
Notice those nasty Russians. Oooo... aren't those vodka drinkers scary!?
Don't vote for those awful, lying right wing political parties... No, we need to keep things just as they are...
That's our best patriotic move. You do love your country, don't you?

Do the exact opposite of what the Biden regime is doing. It's actually a simple fix. But Susan Rice, Sam Power, all the various jews, will die on the DEI hill. I actually understand why now, I didn't before. DEI is actually an extremely powerful tool at their disposal, where they can in principle wreak great changes throughout all of society. It serves a useful propaganda function, but also purges ... difficult whites from all leadership positions. Pretty neat really. Has a big flaw though. Can you guess what it is? Yup, their trannies and cowardly niggers will all be rape-meat on the next battlefield, whilst comfy whites lolz at home and eat cheetos. They still won't drop DEI though, so they are fucked, and honestly I'm fairly sure some of them will hang, lol.

Nah, it's just another part of your mafia of sandniggers.

Jeff Rense: But this group was preceded by another group and a group before that. This is nothing new.

Griggs. Yes, the Dulles group. Paperclip was a huge operation. My grandfather Byrd was a high-level intelligence person during WWII, he was a doctor, he spoke German, he was a brilliant obstetrician. So I know a lot of what was going is on in Norfolk, Virginia, since WWI up through the 80’s. And when I found out that the same thing goes on in other ports. And organized crime is totally involved in it, naturally.

There were German individuals, SS, who came into this country after World War II (in Operation Paperclip). I know because my grandfather was involved with that as a Naval intelligence officer/doctor during WWII. I knew George’s family were German. I realized what he was talking about was institutionalized. It is structural and vital to the system.

MAC-SOG. Is a code word for sending out platoons to kill people in Vietnam. (ETK note: in the “Phoenix Program.”) . SOG is Special Operations Group. If you know anything about the German high command, they are connected with the Opus Dei, they are kind of a business group that works within the Vatican.

Skull and Bones induction methods are now used in the Army. This goes back to the “German thing.” Not everyone does it (homosexual acts). But the ones that do it (are the “rising stars”) and they get right to the top.

“It’s Training and Doctrine Command, it’s NATO, it’s SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe), started by President Eisenhower (a Jew). It’s a totally independent corporation. Its main function is to sell weapons and launder money. It’s all being done by Army people who are now JOINT. The word JOINT is used (Paperclip) to describe the people who came over illegally to escape Nazi Germany.

however, in america, our top institutions are filled with DEI niggers and funds go to support retards who can't be taught anything because they are subhumans with an IQ of 60.

before we bring in ANYONE, including phds and specialists from abroad, we should fix our own intellectual pipeline. we should cultivate the whites here on the homefront before we can determine whether or not we need more highly skilled immigrants.

Kissinger flat out admits this in his last interview. The interviewer asks him how he feels about anti-Israel riots in Germany and his response is

There's 2 kinds of product managers at tech companies. Those that know how to code and have worked in QA, Data, or engineering, and those that have some kind of business degree.

The former usually last in their positions for years, get a good salary, stock options, and are put in charge of important projects. Unfortunately they're about 15 - 20% of product managers and are usually great at their jobs.

The rest are affirmative action hires that are just meant to hit a quota for management roles. They'll be put in charge of worthless projects that have 0 expectation to be completed. The majority of them are women and/or Jeets that don't do shit except make everyone else's life more difficult by scheduling endless meetings while not knowing what your job is. If they do anything useful, it might be color coding your Kanban board. While this seems like a great job for NEETs, everyone fucking hates them. Now that DEI money is drying up because of higher interest rates, their jobs are the first on the chopping block.

Yes. Capitalism, which propped up DEI, is responsible because without capitalism (state-sponsored usury) we would not have niggers in positions of power because kikes wouldn't have been able to make it exceptionally profitable to partake in the DEI nonsense.

The best place to be statistically in a crash is the middle of the plane. If you survive the crash, then your biggest hurdle will be Sh'quesha, Obeast Karen, and the cripples getting in your way, so if you can get an emergency row that is preferable, but just not right next to the door in case some wetback did the maintenance and figured the bolts he found after were just extra and he'd get in trouble if reporting them, so just pocketed them and then the door blew out at 10,000 feet. Also wear your seat belt when in your seat.

Finally, if you get out of the crashed plane, be on the lookout for gung-ho asian Fire Fighters who can't see for shit and will run over you with the truck as your covered in foam they started spraying even as people were trying to get out the plane.

After the crash, you'll need to be weary of kike lawyers and female doctors. And if you have any media posts critical of DEI, the media will publicly shame you for surviving.

Good Luck

No. Marxist Jews left Germany in the 1930s and set up shop. They morphed Marxism in reaction to the failures of Stalinism and the obvious material success of capitalism, also the collapse of the USSR. DEI comes from critical theory and a lineage of commie writers that run from Horkheimer, Marcuse, Foucault and Adorno to Robin DiAngelo and Kimberle Crenshaw. They take some Maoist ideas but don't answer to China at all. Xi must think they are lunatics.

race divisionists cope

Problem is and always be class not race dipshit. Majority of people are not paid enough to afford a home, including airline mechanics. If you dont own property you will never feel truly connected to the country. When you buy a house you have to worry about maintaining the order and standards of the community since it directly affects your property value.

How can someone who does not own property possibly feel like they are connected to the american system? Of course some wrench monkey isnt going to take his job seriously if he thinks the people he is keeping in the air safe are just fucking him financially when they land back home.

What you are seeing isnt DEI causing inefficiencies, its the creation of a serf class that feels no connection or responsibility to their fellow citizens due to their economic standing and outlook, and serfs are only interested in conforming to the point where they preserve themselves

I no longer want to. I do a ‘responsible’ job. Ten years ago it was a tough job because it was complex. Now it’s un-doable because it’s complex, and has layer upon layer of bullshit caked on it. People who have no idea how the job works have risen to a management level and created these layers.
I agree with every word of that complex systems crisis article, but what kills me is it was written by a guy who runs a hedge fund. The need to create constant growth for shareholders in a job that isn’t suited for it is one of the major causes of the bullshit stressors I face.
I am done, I’m burned out and getting sick with stress. The causes are:
- DEI bullshit making the people I have to direct unmanageable, and the design of projects to accommodate it becomes impossible.
- shareholders need growth so we are held to impossible targets while having budgets cut to the bone.
-even the non diverse newbs to the industry aren’t as good as the boomers. Shit on boomers all you like, but they can do the job and they have a broad yet deep understanding of the WHY of the job.

And compete with Jeets for the pleasure. Sorry mate, by all accounts IT/coding is now just another McJob. The simple fact is this gayand kike'd economy cannot endure much longer. Everything in unsustainable. Whites would have had a rock solid monopoly on high intelligence jobs, but the Jew pushed through DEI bullshit to make sure that even as they pushed the blue-collar White out of the economy, they were ethnically cleansing the White collar offices to.

Look at the airline industry. It only works because White men with White intellects and competence work to keep it going.
Now we're being pushed out of that industry, suddenly safety standards are plummeting.

It's really that simple, it's no coincidence that all the public facing jewish billionaires and executives started naming DEI after their home got dabbed on while not even a day before all of them were 100% pushing and praising diversity at every single opportunity.
Make no mistake however, demographic replacement isn't stopping, they're just throttling back the most rabid anti-white golems and simply substituting them with more docile ones that are just as anti-white, but won't have the initiative to mistake jews for white and hate them for it.
Given how much they love degeneracy some high profile public facing jew will probably "come out of the closet" as being mixed nigger or some other disgusting shit and will be paraded around as the thought leaderTM of the new wave of diversity or some other sick shit.

That's why you need to type the following at the end of messages, that demoralize and attack kikes. Posts that make them really seethe, since it's a topic that hurts them in real life.

Like how USA DEI diversity mutt troops won't fight to protect kikes. Unlike the patriotic white males that they demonized, and got to leave the military. Letting them know that the 80yr curse of the jewish state is real, that they're at year 75 and yahoo and cabinet are so paranoid and freaking out about the curse, that they already put boots on the ground in ukraine (aka Khazaria) 5yrs ago, as their exit strategy plan B for when israel collapses.

How only 51% of zoomers believe the holocaust was real, and their only real support is with boomers. That it drops every single generation, and boomers are dying off really soon. That with 2B muslims vs 17M jews globally, and kikes seeing this war as a jewish prophesy of a holy war, that the numbers just aren't there for the kikes. That they'll actually have to fight their own war for once, and kikes literally poopie and wee wee their IDF mandated diapers when they come across a real enemy, that's not simply a child, baby or toddler palestinian civilian in war.

That hey know the end is near, and The Holocaust 2.0: The Non-Fake Edition is upon them. We're reaching the end of the Weimar 2.0, and Khazaria is what zelinsky already referred to as a "big israel" after the war is over. We're coming on the right of the far right in europe and USA, as the pendulum swings from far left, to currently becoming the right, and soon will be far right like much of germany and some other countries are becoming. That Nazi's 2.0 and Hitler 2.0 will soon be upon us.

End the messages with redpills like these, with
Tikkun Olam
TKD

Kikes hate Tikkun Olam in this context, since they realize the world will heal itself from the jewish problem.

There is a DEI/ESG answer to this, and there is a shareholder answer to this(say they're hiring when they aren't). But assuming they are actually hiring, and not padding the accounting books..

I used to interview for some of the companies he applied for. The only people we rejected were the ones that were making shit up(in a bad way) and couldn't find their ass with both hands technically. Learn to say this "I don't know". But we even gave the retards a second chance at an interview in case they were just having an off day or were stressed out.

College doesn't mean anything. Most of the top tier people interviewing never completed college, because you can't learn 3-7 years behind the curve and run a production environment.

Passion for the tech is what people are looking for. And this guys eyes are fucking dead. He has passion for nothing but being a bug trying to eat. I'm amazed he got an internship.

If you are stupid, you have to be willing and happy to learn. If you are smart, you have to be calm and explain who, what, when, why, how.

You can't just go in and say 'Muh dikploma'. They will hate you immediately, because all the people carrying the weight of that company you've been using for decades never had a diploma- because they don't exist. If you want to impress them, get certified in the shit they are hiring you for. It's that simple. Scattershot is not the way.

They need to take the T out of STEM. CS is a meme degree. Oversaturated as fuck because 15 years ago literally everyone was saying "just get into tech bro it's easy money". This lead to current day where 99% of applicants are total fucking retards, and fresh out of college CS holders are the bottom of the barrel of those.
Also Asians are not targeted for DEI so with last name Wu, he is going to have a tough time even for an internship. The only whites and non-jeet Asians they hire must be super competent and experienced. They know they need to use those valuable white/chink/jap slots on the best people they can, since the burden of the spics, jeets, women and niggers falls on their shoulders. So some white or asian with no experience is going to have a very tough time getting their foot in the door.

The short answer is that "innovation" in the US is stagnant. This in turn depresses the market for engineers with oversupply. Then you have the specialization problem someone else mentioned, and that just means more people are excluded on requirements.

You also have HR groups doing the recruiting, which are staffed by mostly women who don't know shit to begin with. Bias against whites/asians because DEI mandates it, which as it turns out most people in engineering are whites/asians.

However, all of this doesn't matter. What matters is that this country can no longer utilize engineering talent that exists. In the long term, this is another indicator that the system itself is broken and heading for collapse. The purportedly greatest country in the world can't find work for ENGINEERS. I mean think about what that says about this country and the future.

It's entirely because they're non-white at the wrench-turning level (due to DEI), but the boomer managerial class is still in place from when the blue collars were also white and could be trusted to follow procedures and do their own QA. You simply cannot manage non-whites the same way you manage whites. Non-whites need visible supervision and EVERYTHING needs to be checked after they say it's done. If you don't check it, they'll notice, and they'll stop doing that work. Not only that, but they'll spread this attitude to white coworkers if the whites are in the minority and are disempowered from scolding their peers. A shop of 8 white men and two spics in 1960 will have 100% compliance, because a white man will catch the spics slacking, scold them, and make sure it's fixed. In 2024, with 8 spics and two white men, the white men will check out because they see the spics slacking and getting paid the same, so fuck it. Even if you have 8 white men and two spics in 2024, due to diversity training and HR bullying, the white men have to walk on eggshells and cannot criticize the spics for slacking off. They'll either do the work of the spics for them and burn out eventually, or they will start slacking off as well because if everyone's doing it, and you can't discipline the protected classes, everyone gets to skate and nobody can be punished.

Boomer managers who should have retired a decade ago don't understand this and don't really care because THEY'RE checked out, too. Social security is all lined up, pensions are set, retirement accounts/plans are stuffed, and if they get fired they get severance on top of all that.

Basically I fully expect a flight full of Americans to fall out of the sky sometime this year. Depending on when and the circumstances, it might lead to a full repeal of federal diversity mandates across the board. I'd give the odds of the second part happening 1%, and the first part like 60%.

Corporations know that they have a hard time filling positions with quality people because (besides DEI which is another issue) they resent paying them to do the work. But they either won't or can't admit that, because it makes them look bad to the public, so what they do is insist that it's because the vetting process isn't strict enough. So they make you jump through hoops for months until they finally make a decision (and the indecisiveness is largely due to incompetent, insecure female HR people) and you end up going through months of hell to get a job in which your superiors are still gonna seethe every time they think about your salary and how it's cutting into their bonuses. Then when the numbers come out you get to hear them talk about how, even though they made 8% more than they did last quarter, they wanted to make 10%, so it's still a 2% loss and it's all the workers' faults for not producing more. So then they get to justify denying cost of living increases and bonuses.

The only two choices are for them to admit they're going too far or double down and make it even harder. Which way do you think it's gonna go before this is all over? Wait until they find a way to trap quality people in companies so that they can't leave, by providing housing and shit like Amazon is doing, like the old coal mining companies did at the turn of the 20th century. It's nothing new by any means. Zoomies just think it's new because they think everything's new because they're so deliberately ignorant of history.

The height of US military capability is probably ~1987

Most of the gear being used today is either the exact same shit we were using in 1987, genuinely shittier than what we had in 1987, or produced in such small volume it won't matter in an actual war as the expected attrition cannot be overcome by potential production.

When you look at the trajectory of things, nothing is getting better. The US military a year from now will be LESS capable than it is today, and while the 1987 gear is 'good enough' it is, again, the type of shit that requires constant maintenance and high IQ soldiers to make effective, and the brain drain, let alone manpower drain, on the US military is probably the single biggest offender for the next major military defeat. DEI and jewish corruption have destroyed the US military, we're already airborne off the tracks and it's quite literally just waiting for the crash at this point.

I wouldn't call the US/NATO a paper tiger per se. The weapons are effective when you have all the right conditions, but the thing is - it's not 1987 anymore. We don't have all the right conditions. Javelins aren't being used by 105 IQ G.I. Joe, they're being used by 85 IQ Jamal who doesn't understand what a battery is, why the javelin needs to be cooled down for 15 minutes before firing, and would struggle to hit a fucking barn anyway.

The E in DEI does not stand for equality. It stands for equity.
The difference is that old leftist thought was that women and shitskins should have equal opportunities, and that employers should be required to hire equally qualified candidates no matter their race.
The problem though is it turns out, most women and shitskins ARENT qualified. So even with equal opportunities being enforced, it barely made a difference. You'd have a few black doctors, the Ben Carson types, you'd have the occasional woman engineer. But it was still extremely rare.
So they moved the goalposts. They decided that if equal opportunities isn't enough, then it must be systemic racism. That the criteria being used to decide if one is qualified is itself has racism based into it. Same argument they make with IQ tests. Because they are THAT sure that differences in capability can't be genetic.
So now they push EQUITY (communism), which isn't forced equal opportunitu, but forced equal results. Meaning all professional should be 50% female. Niggers should make up 13% of all professions. Beaners, etc the same.
This is accomplished by redoing certification tests so that niggers can pass them, and forcing employers to have racial and sex-based hiring quotes. That is, to hire a the incompetent nigger over the competent white man BECAUSE he is a nigger and that number needs made up.
Leftists have decided that meritocracy itself is racist and sexist and must be thrown out. This is bringing forth the competency crisis. Because intentionally hiring incompetent people means competent people, who designed and built things like Boeing aircrafts, get pushed out in favor of people who don't understand them and can't maintain them properly.

Yes Anon. I'm the reason why qualified candidates aren't getting hired. Not the loosening of visa requirements leading to an influx of cheap Jeet labor. Not the demise of the family leading to an increase in women flooding the workforce and utilizing education and career enrichers when, more ofthen than not, they end up "taking a break" to have a kid. Not the increase in DEI which made globohomo force hirers to REALLY start using "white male" as a negative against an applicant.

Nope it's me saying that "fix your resumes" is boomer ass advice.

There's a difference between grifting and meeting people so that when there is a job opening you can reach out to them. If you sit in college and just do assignments like a good goy, your resume isn't going to somehow convince Beckie at HR that you're a good fit, or Patel #712 that you're great for an entry level job. But knowing that one bugman who works there and would get a referral fee if you get hired does help.

It's patronizing and fake, dude. You know this. Did America recently decide that woke and DEI and sexual degeneracy were bad things after all? I don't think so. Those things are still the values the American establishment promotes. That means America is anti-white and anti-heteronormative as whiteness and heteronormativity are seen as regressive and oppressive. The army is pleading for white men to join it for old times' sake like America was still like it was before the insanity got out of hand. That pitch is not going to fool most people. Why would a young white American man with approximately traditional values based on common sense want to join the army of a system that scapegoats him and is literally designed to be against him?

My understanding is that the Competency Crisis theory is firmly rooted in blaming "civil rights" movements and DEI policies for declining outcomes in western society, while "woke" is a term made fashionable by boomer christcuck MIGAtards almost purposely to avoid recognizing anti-white behavior as such.
I don't see the two as equivalent at all. Maybe neither goes far enough, but the CSWSCC philosophy is far closer to where we should be.

White people are a threat to democracy. They cant help but lie to build up justification for their racism and enacting jewish marxist laws. They have to lie and lie more and can never admit weakness or defeat. They can always blame the people they enslaved and forced into wars.

I was in the RAF. Left in mid 2010s.
The RAF had been in a terminal decline during my time. Stations closing, sqns disbanding, redundancies.
The promise of adventure, opportunity, overseas experience, just evaporated.
I remember the early form of DEI starting to emerge. STarted to be a real push for women and BAME to be at the front of all media.
I remember a trans pilot. Kept thinking - how the fuck are they not discharged for being mentally ill?
Whole place was going to shit. Came from a long line of family in RAF and wanted a full career. Shit was depressing.
Left and did something far better with my time.
Kept watching over last 10yrs. Kept getting worse. Unbelievable. itsallsotiresome.jpg
I now tell people to avoid the very thing that was such a source of pride for my family. I wouldn't advise anyone to go near the UK military.
BBC keep warning about le evil Putin and those pesky Russians
No Russian ever formed a rape gang in my city, never preached to our schoolchildren to chop off their genitals, never turned my city into a ghetto and shat in the streets, TV adverts dont feature endless Russians, no Russians are running around London stabbing white kids, there's no Russian riots in our streets in honour of some drug addicted serial criminal George Floydski....

Tim Walberg (R-MI) said at the hearing, “Carole Hooven, an evolutionary biologist, was forced to resign, because she stated that a person’s sex is biological and binary. . . . and so, President Gay, in what world is a call for violence against Jews protected speech, but a belief that sex is biological and binary isn’t?”

The call center operator would literally bullshit for him and lead him to answer correctly in the interview.
Then last year he had to give id with a photo and they seen he is white.
Interview had some dei nigress actively trying sabotage him to get him to answer some bullshit in a way they can reject him..
But autistic he is so he knew all the right answers.

Academia was supposed to be about the search for truth. Sadly these people discovered a truth that is so heinous to them that they have to destroy education, and a generation to keep people from accepting that truth. Its why DEI has taken over everything and it will become undeniable in the end. You can fight the truth all your life but you always lose to it in the end.

it becomes obvious that plot and narrative are moulded round the need (because DEI is likely a factor) to include certain things, oh yes they may cleverly subvert your expectations every now and again but this merely serves to remind you that they know very well what they are doing

It is in part though. It used to be the case that when you were in, a lot of the ranking up was the result of nepotism, or people going to West Point or the right ROTC program, of who they knew, of being a mouthpiece for their senior leadership, but there was that 25% of slots where a good soldier could rank up and have a good career. They would never make brigadier general unless but they could conceivably retire as a colonel with a good career behind them. Now, that number is more like 5% because those slots are given to DEI. So basically, it’s pointless if you didn’t go to West Point and at West Point, many of the slots are being given to women.

We are seeing this across every institution in this country. The people from elitist schools and families are closing ranks and where there used to be room for meritocracy, that is increasingly being traded away for diversity. It’s well-known that if you’re a young white male from a middle class family, you can forget about going to a top university and climbing the ranks in a large corporation on your own merit. It just simply will not happen. The same is true in the military.


So if you can’t make a career out of it, and you can’t, it becomes more of a question of a stint for the benefits and that tilts the scales in favor of benefits not being worth it because you can’t resort to “well, if I like the military, I’ll just stay in”.

I mean... aren't these things literally the explicit goals of DEI? Explain to me how anyone even remotely familiar with the space could quizzically scratch their chin about why white men feel this way. I don't think there's a DEI advocate on earth who wouldn't freely tell a white man that
"You and your candid thoughts are literally the entire problem" and "Our strategy is to actively marginalize you." I thought that was the whole idea.

It's not that there's anything crazy about saying "Oh gee, maybe there's a reason to actually engage with white guys cooperatively." But they so specifically chose to do the opposite that I struggle to believe that they might suddenly change course as if this is an unexpected turn. There was no accident.

"Within today's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, white men are often absent from the conversation. In one survey, 68 percent of white men said they didn't feel part of DEI efforts and conversations. Some felt they were seen as the problem. Others (64 percent) felt they didn't have the ability to speak candidly in conversations with colleagues from marginalized groups."

"But given the wide representation of white men in positions of power in both the public and private sectors, we need to meaningfully engage them in the conversation to make real change. For example, of the 533 executive officers among the S&P 100, 70 percent are white men. In the public sector, despite representing only 30 percent of the population, white men hold 62 percent of elected offices. The group holding some of the greatest power to influence change are the ones most absent from the conversation about making it. Both our firsthand observations and the social sciences have shown us that when it comes to influencing white men to participate in conversations about racial equity and creating a more equitable world, a powerful place to begin is with their own experience of belonging."

Powerful. Your thoughts on the new open mindedness towards inclusion of white men in DEI, /pol/? It really makes you feel embraced by your country, doesn't it? Maybe we can start being patriotic again.

Im assuming that these dudes know people in other states, but it's basically word of mouth. If you are Catholic look into Opus Dei. Lots of pretty based people, lots of lawfags

This. DEI programs are still being run in pretty much every major institution. I work for the city rails and I was forced to attend the program on it. I wasn't even allowed to ask any questions or make any comments (I still did though and they simply told me this meeting isn't for asking questions).

Fed gov will lose all credibility. Starting ww3 while texas gives them the finger will show the public worldwide they're a paper tiger. Americans will backlash HARD against migrants and DEI niggers.

But that's ok, the other 49 can keep pretending to understand Florida politics. Absolutely he fucked us on insurance, but to sit here and pretend the legislature is doing anything good without his direction is retarded. I could stab Tim Pool for continuing to pretend the legislature is the only reason we have permitless carry, no vax mandates, total DEI death and abortion bans.

I thought DEI in medicine meant giving admission slots to minorities, how does going to a country with basically no whites represent an improvement in that regard?
They still have to be competent minorities or they'll flunk out of medical school, right?

The illegal immigrants will now be given free housing for up to 2 years. Paid monthly. Free education, english training, job training, voucher for a free vehicle, food stamps, and free health care.

Janet Mills initially stated that there will be 75,000 "New Americans" but that number has been increased to 150,000. That is more than 10% of Maine's population.

The NEW National Guard General (master of DEI initiatives) will also be working hand in hand with Janet Mills to fill the ranks with the migrants.

Companies in Maine can't successfully achieve DEI demands and initiatives due to the State being too white, so this also another way to fix it.

The initial number was 75,000 that since has doubled. They are also creating a pathway for their family numbers. Over the next decade number range from 200,000 to 300,000 "New Mainers".

Right now the Jews are pushing to destroy DEI Diversity Equity and Inclusion because non whites are almost 100% Palestinian and see Jews as whites, so it back fired. Jews are hated by Brown people. Jews implemented DEI hard under Obama to displace whites, they programmed whites to LOVE DIVERSITY.... now Jews are deprogramming them to hate DEI and go on MERIT... which will result in whites hateing niggers for their low IQ retardation.... so to answer your Question, If the Jews can Program an entire nation to love Diversity and as soon as it puts Jews in a bad position transition all these people to look at diversity and say no now its based on Merit is essentially TOTAL CONTROL of the Masses.... so 100% of the Culture is NPC.... Those that are not in the Culture IE Nazis who are scared the systems fires them these people are not NPC's and understand the Jewish question.... essentially what percent of Americans are Nazis and thats percent is your Answer, you are prob a NPC who is only aware NPC's exist but is not aware that he himself is one.

>THE WHITENESS PROBLEM
Not enough white people. Too many brown people. What can we do about it?

First thing is to deincentivize the hoards flocking here. Stop giving gibs to foreigners. Make it so you have to have to do SOMETHING at least before you're given gibs. Clinton had a welfare to work program and they shut that down quick because it was actually good and taking niggers off their voter plantation.

Another thing would be to reincentivize reproduction for white people. Make divorce rape harder. Offer the same programs for first time home buyers to white that you offer to blacks. Put an end to DEI so whites will actually get the good jobs again.

Unfortunately the demographics are already what they are, but that doesn't mean nothing can be done.

They can't rely on the West, not because they don't control the West, but because the West IS unreliable, largely due to the consequences of their own actions pushing progressive bullshit.

It's quite brilliant in execution, there isn't a way to turn a 15 year old nig into a functioning member of society anymore. Families are destroyed, and we're stuck feeding them when they aren't wasting a DEI position in the government performing a make-work or do-nothing job.

These aren't problems and are actually the point, it's solely down to the facts for each individual student stripped of any ideology. There's no bias by administrators possible at any stage, no locus to form a movement around to complain and reform it. Any complaints about it being racist because black people are stupid would be self defeating and has no ideological legitimacy unlike nebulous and unquantifiable biases of the people doing the administrating.
I think such a "merit based system" is the only politically palatable way to stop the endless DEI kvetching.

I went to college because I just felt like it. My wife did the same thing, then we went into grad school because it's something we both enjoy. To be honest with you, anyone who goes to college to make a profit is a retard, especially with the push for DEI growing since 2008. Most of the students I've interacted with are dejected materialists, and graduated students for the clubs I run have been struggling to find work for more than 2+ years. Some of which are fairly competent. (They come around every few weeks because we have a job board and this is the only networking they had done.)
Most people should skip college, just pick up books on the given subject, and self-study for the next 2 - 3 years of their life on that subject. Find communities that discuss the subjects you care about and involve yourself. If the community you want doesn't exist, create it. Self-directed free colleges wouldn't be the worst possible thing, it's what the Greeks did.

lel DEI is a relatively small fraction of ESG, and it barely impacts lending rates (if at all). The real carrot on the stick was the thought that capital allocators wouldn't want to make money by supporting businesses doin the icky stuff, and that quantifying presumed virtuous or responsible behavior would create sustainable demand for shares of companies that met those standards, thus permanently lifting share prices relative to their less responsible peers. There's some merit to that, too -- the tobacco stocks trade at serial discounts to companies that are otherwise similar.

Can't tell you how many times I've seen people here railing about woke businesses being blackrock lapdogs without realizing that those specific companies have shitty ESG scores. It's just venting ill informed outrage.

Not as low knowledge as you'd think. Yes, it did to an extent push for what you have listed above. But, for the most part companies implemented the DEI bullshit to get their score that much higher and better rates from investment institutions.

I'm not a DEI student, I had to earn my way in unlike some of my "peers". I was disillusioned twice. First, out of high school into college: Nothing like I was raised to believe. Second, "merit" hardly matters unless you're a White male.
Anyways, thanks, I wish you all the luck on your end as well.

They're figuring it out. Let's not abandon our brothers in need.

>You will live to see Russian troops on the continent.

You will live to participate in the american civil war #2, also known as the "kill whitey boogaloo". The american army is being transformed into a politically reliable force aimed at internal suppression. What do you think all this CRT stuff, tranny stuff, DEI stuff is about?

You dumbass jew serving jew loving formerly white amerimutts are presently being squeezed out of society and the armed forces, when you are sufficently dispossessed you will be actively deleted by the diversity and inclusion.

It doesn't matter that you have your AR-15s, most of you are vaccinated and the jews have an endless supply of new american soldiers to recruit in the third world. This is not going to end well for you or the canadians.

It's a sad state of affairs, man. From everything that I've seen lately, it seems as though the left is pushing for segregation again. You write well, so I'm going to assume you aren't a DEI student. Keep well and I wish you the best in your career.

They also fired everyone who was competent slightly before the 747 MAX incidents because they wanted yes men when they were warned about the mind bogglingly dumb software decision that killed multiple planes worth of people. I have no doubts that DEI contributed to this, but Boeing is a trainwreck of a company. I would never feel safe on one of their planes after the 747 MAX deaths even if the pilot and everyone who worked on the plane was white unless the entire board of executives was replaced. Actually, I take that back. Just make sure that all the Jews are replaced and the company would be fine.

> DEI mechanics?
This is the first time I heard this. Considering it is only being mentioned here and twitter, the only conclusion to reach is that it’s a DEI failure because the MSM isn’t and will not be reporting this news.

>Affirmative Action lets them get Hired instantly by forced Equality by Virtue Signaling Woke ideology
>White Homogeneous Societies goes the way of Africa/South America/Middle-East/Asia aka Barbaric 1st/2nd/3rd Density ie [Service to Self] mentality

This. Going full retard and putting something like xe/xir or whatever would make them laugh even harder, but he/they would let them fulfill the state mandated DEI quota and still get someone that could possibly be a least workably sane.

That's why larry fink and his buddies give DEI funds to compensate the hiring of shitskins en masse, now look at boeing planes falling to the ground or just dislocating itself mid-air lol

Can someone put a great Boeing logo on this with a caption somehow relating to:
"We blow the doors wide open on DEI"
"I am in Charge of your safety"
"I built the plane you will fly on"
etc.
