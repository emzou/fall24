Couple things: if the sitting VP is not the automatic choice for replacement, the House of Cards completely collapses, not to mention the DEI police running amok. Historical discrimination will be the theme. And if he is too senile for the convention, HE IS TOO SENILE TO BE POTUS. So: if she invokes the 25th before the convention, she is the incumbent. Try cancelling THAT. And even if, is she still on the ticket? As VPOTUS or POTUS? These are uncharted waters - and you have to ask why was the debate held before the convention? Nancy knows.

Basic is petty and annoying, most of it is inspections and all the skills related to it, as for the people.
You'll be the only one on base who hasn't chugged the zog Koolaid if you browse here.

Actual basic; Farmer walks and stair climbing. You'll be on the 6th floor or 10th, it's a lot of stairs.
Push ups are used for torture, so do lots but pretend to struggle cause they want to see u suffer.
You'll be in CFLRS and that place is a prison. The swipe systems so petty that the movie Salo is exactly what it feels like to be in Basic. Watch that movie to understand your 8 weeks better.

Do the Mike Mentzer training, do Farmer walks and you should be fine.
Most failures are injury related which are fatties or weak legs or other.

Avoid combat and Support trades, DEI should be there but theyre all white men. Logistics is for the white man but it's a mixture.
It's a great job, avoid Army Element unless you like barracks and forests, Navy if you like East or West coast with shitty ships, Air Force if you like whiny faggots

>Only jews think in terms of profit over society's well being.
Actually, we are seeing this because the jews have transformed the economy into a post-capitalist one where things like profit don't matter as much as how much the company cares about society's well being.
The real problem is that when companies try to increase their stock prices by pretending to care about society's well being, they do so with things like DEI initiatives, hiring tranny influencers, promoting gay pride month and BLM, and whatever other kinds of jew globohomo that they can think of to increase their ESG scores.
And even if the people who manage the large institutional investors that drive the stock market think all of that stuff is fake and gay, they also know that the other investors think that increasing ESG means increasing prices, so they will start buying the stock, driving the price higher. So the people who think it is bullshit will still end up buying the stock too, because they basically have a fiduciary duty to the people whose money they are managing to do so.
It's all very tiresome and jewish.

>ESG, DEI, D&I, and Corporate Leftism

Every corporation has a chief diversity officer, and leadership is fired if they don't build DEI teams.

Investment firms push green goals, diversity goals, etc. on most if not all beneficiaries. If companies want subsidized business costs to starve out their competition, they must adhere to leftist agendas.

UN origins

Pressure isn't just applied from the firm down to the beneficiaries, but from, for example, large state funds using the firm's services like California does. They tell blackrock to adhere to these agendas or they'll move their money elsewhere. Whoever has the money has the power.

Fiduciaries have a legal responsibility to do what makes the most profit, therefore doing what's morally right is sometimes forbidden.

How much COVID and 2023 bailout money was given to blackrock, vanguard, state street, etc? This all gets used to push ESG goals.

Discrimination lawsuits are also a big deterrent to companies that want to hold traditional values.

Larry Fink proactively responds to climate issues, racial issues, feminist issues, why wouldn't he respond to Jewish issues, being a Jew himself?

Everyone saw the Chink reveal themselves recently. Although, it could potentially be a troll or a kike with an false 'reveal' as an attempt at misdirection. At any rate, it's someone that is trying to have a divisive thread between Americans and Nips. The biggest problem is that the American armed forces are now considered ZOG and pro-tranny/homosexual i.e. DEI level captured organizations that no longer represent the people, so it's pretty weak to try and get Americans to support the sexual abuser position when they can't even recruit them anymore. It seems it's an attempt at best to get Americans to associate positively with military through the label "American."

I strongly suspect that many of the foreign Doctors and Nurses working here in US hospitals would be revealed to have a similar story to this if one were to dig into their backgrounds. A lot of the foreign doctors and nurses you encounter in the average American hospital these days have the fucking IQ of a yam and it's utterly vexing to think about how the fuck they ended up in their respective posts. Massive fraud and a DEI atmosohere of non critical evaluation is one of the only logical explanations.

It is. Pic related is essentially what you get for paying bills off in full every month, and Americans only need a 760+ to be eligible for favorable rate loans. Anything extra just means you're highly likely to be exceptionally responsible with handling debt. It is extremely easy to max the good goy score and most Americans are incredibly negligent with debt. They flaunt all sorts of expensive shit they don't own to everyone else and taunt Euros that they're poor. Don't be fooled, the bank owns all of that. Most Americans probably don't even own the clothes on their back.

There are no jobs, and the professional field is worse.

In a recession, generally being young and strong saved you because labor always had a minimum value, but they have imported so many illegals.

On the professional end, companies would only be hiring the best of the best, which would be White and Asian men. However, because of DEI executive orders on tax credits, grants, and contracts companies are only hiring token diversity hires.

Like this job for example. It is essentially written so they can exclude anyone because there are lists and list of criteria and the salary is garbage.

if i did things different i would have worked a summer to get a down payment in the city of my birth when homes were expensive, worked while going through nursing school, and then graduate, work with all the DEI riff raff -- buy a stolen re-vinned range rover, make 250, 000 a year with shift premiums and overtime and live in a house bought outright that is now worth a million dollars. everything seems so simple in hindsight.

>Also punishments are fucking GAYYYYY.
The military system of punitive punishment certainly doesn't actually do its job. It just makes people want to quit earlier. I rarely witnessed people receiving a 45/45 that didn't deserve it, but I'm also aware that there are some officers that don't deserve their commission. I keep a very wide berth from anyone who is both incompetent and also willing to preserve their own safety at the cost of others. This applies to civilian and military. False accusations are a massive pain in the ass to deal with.

There are different avenues of administrative violence that apply to enlisted and officers. Enlisted have the UCMJ for the most part, or administrative action for senior enlisted (i.e. GOMOR), but to relieve an officer of command requires a coordinated conspiracy of enlisted, as well as a command and climate survey where greater than 10% of their respective group absolutely shitting on their performance in a corroborated manner. After that the officer in question tends to get passed around like a hot potato elsewhere or imprisoned to the staff office, where careers go to die.

Doesn't work for senior officers though, the military apparatus has a clear interest in covering up anything embarrassing to the military above O-6. I've heard many stories of drunk DEI generals having to be driven home by the MPs or Security forces. They somehow managed to fail up into a position where they can make decisions that can ruin everyone's lives below them, and shit rolls downhill fast.

The left is collapsing everywhere. The Liberal party here just lost a by-election in a riding they've held for 20 years, typically with 20%+ margins. They even kept it in 2011 when the Liberal party collapsed and barely cracked double digits. All the MPs that used to have guaranteed votes from faggots and idiots in Toronto are worried about their seats now and some will probably call for Trudeau to step down.
Weak men have created hard times. Now that normalfags are worried about paying their bills and buying food all the useless virtue signalling and DEI crap that we were sick of years ago isn't so attractive to them anymore.

I've honestly observed this at my company. Company has always been kinda rah-rah about diversity, but the pre-2020 blacks are mostly assimilated in to their jobs and are fine.

1) exported jobs and factories overseas to circumvent American workers.

3) wasted trillions on foreign wars that didn't help us.
4) stole from us via inflation.
5) given themselves generous tax cuts.
6) censored speech by colluding with Big Tech.
7) spied on us without a warrant.
8) spent trillions to bail out their banks.
9) used taxpayer money to fund foreign gain of function research.
10) ruined countless lives with senseless covid restrictions.
11) discriminated on the basis of race and gender via DEI/ESG.
12) ruined vidya by making games woke and boring.
13) held themselves to a lower standard than they hold us.
14) made it obvious that politicians are controlled puppets.
15) corrupted democracy with foreign money and ballot fraud.
16) created an opioid drug epidemic.
17) used the National Guard to fight a war for Israel.
18) wasted trillions on green energy nonsense.
19) committed treason against Trump.

He saw the Jews out right frame him and try to get him executed not once but twice and did fuck all. He was copied in a color revolution and didn’t take a single act to stop it.

Fuck is he going to do for us?

Of course it isn't but Thomas isn't from the DEI era, he's from "equally qualified" era, and most people didn't have a problem with that. The DEI era people have been almost uniformly bad, although I will admit that Ketanji Jackson did have a good concurrence on the Obstruction decision. But even that was just at the level of what I would expect from a Supreme Court Justice, it wasn't anything special.

(KRON) — Tractor Supply Co., one of America’s go-to home-improvement stores, announced changes to its company on Thursday that have sparked nationwide debate. The company said it would stop backing Pride celebrations, drop its carbon emission goals, and focus its resources elsewhere.

“We have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,” Tractor Supply said on X, three weeks after they created their account on the social media platform. “We have taken this feedback to heart.”

From now on, the company said their “activities” will be tied directly to their business. Changes include:

No longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign
Stop sponsoring nonbusiness activities like Pride festivals and voting campaigns
Eliminate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) roles and retire current DEI goals “while still ensuring a respectful environment”
Further focus on rural American priorities, including agriculture education, animal welfare, veteran causes and “being a good neighbor”
Withdraw carbon emission goals and focus on our land and water conservation efforts
In reply to the company, California Senator and Former Chair to the Legislative LGBTQ Caucus Scott Wiener called the announcement an intimidation tactic from the right wing. “The mob rule continues, at the expense of anyone who doesn’t fit into their 1950 whitewashed version of America,” he said on X.

Tractor Supply Co. has been in business for over 85 years and employs over 50,000 team members in 2,250 stores nationwide. “Rural communities are the backbone of our nation and what makes America great,” the company said.

Ancestral European religions fastest growing religions in the West! Anonymous ID:PYaSA17V Fri 28 Jun 2024 13:35:30 No.472494614  Replies: 3 ViewReport
With the impending death of christjewery, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend!

>1) Economically, with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>2) Politically, jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>3) Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

GET FUCKED NIGGERS.

Conservative commentator and filmmaker Robby Starbuck conducted an intensive three-week investigation into Tractor Supply, revealing and sharing on X how the US retailer, known for selling farm goods to rural Americans (mainly freedom-loving Republicans), has been donating to woke radical leftist causes that do not resonate with its customer base. The retailer, in response, abruptly scrapped its climate targets and diversity, equity, and inclusion fantasies late Thursday, preventing itself from getting 'Bud Light'd' by its customer base.

From now on, the retailer claims it will retire its woke activism by nuking its DEI objectives and, instead, focus on actual and legitimate causes such as "ag education, animal welfare, veteran causes and being a good neighbor..."

--> No longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign.
--> Refocus our Team Member Engagement Groups on mentoring, networking and supporting the business.
--> Further focus on rural America priorities including ag education, animal welfare, veteran causes and being a good neighbor and stop sponsoring nonbusiness activities like Pride festivals and voting campaigns.
--> We will review and consider revising our current DEI goals while still ensuring a respectful environment.
--> Withdraw our data on emissions and focus on our land and water conservation efforts.

Nah, too busy being forced to try to socialize with people who, just ten years ago, were celebrating communist ideologies of racial hatred, and just four years ago was demanding that my rights be taken away because I chose not to receive the vaccine.

You want case analysis? Too fucking bad. The DEI doctor and Sheriff Federspiel have successfully entwined local law enforcement with psychiatry to perpetuate Soviet style abuses, in the form of political retaliation.

Basically, my stories are a sign of mental illness, according to Democratic Party Doctor Chinye Showole, who suddenly became my doctor right as Judge Andre Borrello ramped up the sabotage in May/June 2023.

A year goes by and as soon as I write "Goon June", discussing Nina Simone's bipolar disorder, Chinye Showole begins questioning if I think I have bipolar.

I've been under a character and fitness process for the Michigan State Bar for six years, which that process involved numerous psychologists, one a PhD, thoroughly examining my mental health and arriving at ADHD and, later, autism.

On the whim of me writing Goon June and writing about Nina Simone, my doctor has since tried telling me that writing books is a sign of "racing thoughts" and so she said she refuses to treat me further until I go and get evaluated at a county mental health clinic that has 1.7 stars on Google.

Sorry, but I'm not letting Soviet Psychiatry fuck me over. So, without my meds, who knows if I'll have the mentality to write stories.

Flowers for Algernon and it's because I don't want to hang out with the sting operants Sheriff Federspiel and Great Lakes Bay Health Center/Davenport Zersetzung me with.

Bankrupting America via pointless proxy wars in the Ukraine and Israel. Antagonising China through Taiwan, while refusing to aid Australia in bringing the Pasifika nations in line, turning Australia into a useless outpost and taking on a lot more burden in the region. Failing to put an end to Yemen and their terrorist separatists, forcing the prices of goods flowing through there to skyrocket, essentially forcing Africa and Europe towards aligning with the Orient instead of the West.

At home he allowed finance to inject steroids, putting millions of Americans on the streets and preventing the next two generations of Americans (at least) from ever amounting to anything. He encouraged Black nationalists to rise up, weaponised DEI to undermine the state, gave Mexicans and other Latinx people to flood into the country without reprimand. He did nothing to forward worker's rights and instead allowed AI companies push out shitty code and encouraged businesses to abandon human responsibility, undercutting any possible advancement that could be made with this life changing technology. He weaponised the court system to destroy political opponents, both inside and outside of his party.

The positives are few and far between, but he did implement a bunch of protectionist measures. He drastically increased the trade war with China and even hindered friendshoring so things are made in America again. He propped up the Quad and a bunch of other regional alliances. He didn't go full retard to help Britain, and instead let them turn into a dumpster fire. He fought for Catholicism and put an end to a lot of Evangelical missions that were killing Africa. He made it so gays are loved and protected in America. He is saving the planet through encouraging sustainable development and pushed for environmentally friendly electricity generation like solar panels and wind power.

(((They))) are once again temporarily supporting Trump out of desperation because their Golems have turned on them on the left. Trump should pick Sanders for VP, shut down ALL immigration, deport prolifically without comment, ban sale of real estate to foreign interests, bring high tech manufacturing home, incarcerate employers of illegals, start shooting down and sinking any Russian/Chinese planes/boats that violate any territory that we want. What Ivan and Chang gonna do? America should become a self sufficient Uber bully and maintain global stability until we figure out how to colonize the solar system.

The real story..
During the time this all happened a lot of other big streamers were making huge deals on other platforms and with other big sponsors. He was in a contract exclusive with twitch that he wanted out of you can even see some of his leaked "concepts" for dr disrespect stores and merch. Those were only some ideas that he wasn't allowed to follow up on under contract. During that same time period they hired dei hires to moderate twitch. Remember the creature claiming to be a deer that hates straight white men and would seek to ban them? Going thru twitch rules and looking for grey areas to get out of a contract you can see why things went down the way they did but it took time. He wanted out of the contract but wanted to be paid. This is why he never followed up on anything in the sceencaps. This is why he is not going public defending any of this and telling the actual truth. If its found out he deliberately did this to get out of a contract that paid him in full just imagine. He would have to pay it back and likely be sued for more and then have the accusations against him still. I think he knew this was coming at some point. He takes the walk of shame but he takes that walk with his $ and the doc gets to retire for now. Atleast it aint a sandyhook moment where they keep taking until nothing is left.

Did you ever see the duck that runs marathons? It even has little shoes and everything! He thinks he's people! It's so funny to watch! But when you get down to brass tacks, it's just side show entertainment, not a competitor for Olympic gold.

Women in the workplace are just like that. They look so cute and funny in their little outfits, with the pink hard hat and slide rule... almost like a real engineer! But in the end that's all it is, playacting for entertainment, not the main event. Allowing Boeing's DEI department to design your aircraft gives the same predictable results as placing all your money on the duck to actually win marathons.

this. all these old movies just chose a settings because the culture was cool to explore and gave a nice flavor to a simple kid's story. Today, a culture is used because there are quotas to fill, rather than just because it seems fun.
I can't put my finger on what exactly gives it away, it feels more verbose in many cases, sometimes it's also the plot just being very obviously about some basic faggot prog talking point, and like there's a massive emphasis on the culture/race in a very superficial way (not talking about live actions those are 100% mask off lol), rather than as you said dressing for a nice story.

It's also the irl cultural landscape since it's very obvious that today these things are done due to DEI infiltration

The BLM/DEI push we made had no impact on bringing in the the single mom, "strong independent wahmen", onions boy and "urban" markets.

Turns out Bill's racist and sexist market research that showed those demographics have no interest, or even capability, of doing home improvement, was true.

The context with those movies are that the brown people are the majority race in the setting.
I wouldn't want to see white people in "The Emperor's New Groove" because it doesn't make sense.

Investment group with trillions of dollars that influence most companies these days. This is why more and more companies are becoming private, instead of allowing jews to manipulate and destroy their companies on the public stock exchange, that is manipulated by the fed, with the help of the dtcc, and most of the shares in America aren't owned by investors, its owned by a company called "Cede and co".
Blackrock is the parasite that is utilized to take control of their boards and to destroy the company for personal gain.

First, thank you for stopping by here, much appreciated.
What is the general view on Israel and it's economy? Not jews but Israel, and what should be done about it? From your peers and bosses perspective. What does Israel produce?
Then, what is the consensus about the competency crisis/productivity, domestic problems among the lower classes in America, DEI and race relations/feminism? Any notice by any top dog that it might be wise to pull back on that?
Also, any word on changing the financial system though CBDC's or any fintech implementation?
Lastly, Davos isn't a place where european aristocrats go to, it's a forum for the noveau rich, and it's not necessarily pararel to the European Union's interests.

Look no further than how our society, and especially its women, view, treat, and pay its GARBAGE COLLECTORS. Yes, a job that has been mocked and looked down for ages. Yet, when COVID had our society locked up by hysteria, with people self-isolating, refusing to go to work, etc., the garbage men came every week to make sure everyone wouldn't suffocate in their own filth. In other words, it's a necessary job, as are most sanitation and waste jobs. Far more than many government jobs.

Remember when Musk took over Twitter and fired a shitload of the workforce? Remember what happened? Nothing. LOL. The company still existed and the service/website still operated. It was DEI/ESG and make-work people he axed. We need something like that, but on a mass, nationwide scale.

Without the US’s high IQ security tech sector and industrial capacity the world will have to fully commit to global government as globalized economies are crippled by the vacuum left by the US Navy securing the sea trade routes that let that economy exist. The US’s high IQ security tech sector (Boeing, Raytheon, etc.) is dead, DEI bullshit killed it, and it is moving on the enertia of its previous innovation. US industrial capacity is already dead. Sure, we can manufacture really advanced guided missiles (as long as we have a safe sea route to a peaceful Taiwan for chips), but COVID revealed we don’t even make common antibiotics stateside anyone and need virtually all of our emergency equipment shipped from China, our most likely adversary. The collapse has two possible outcomes: the reemergence of regional powers with global trade becoming much more tediously negotiated and expensive and the return of local economic production’s importance and something more like traditional nationalism (this is the good ending) or full mask-off commitment to open global government with the remnant of the US military and its tech as an integral part of the enforcement that treats your nation as an economic zone full of exploitable resources that belong to Jews that you happen to be living in.

Comms.

Something going down in Omaha, or something related to Omaha Beach/D-Day (DD = 44, but this one is a strong 22 coder with a more unformed, secondary 44 code attached, so something initiating or progressing towards a D-Day scenario - a big military push or landing somewhere intended to achieve a bunch of stuff all at once and bring one of the fake war dramas to a speedy end I presume - for the election I guess, since releasing Assange is only gonna get them so far since he's now essentially gagged and taking down a ton of wikileaks stuff, so we won't be seeing anything new from him ever again. Not that you could blame him).

General tip:
Story = White people worse than Niggers? (particularly ones about muh whites doing bad stuff to kids) = Comms.
Story = Niggers better than White People? (acting completely out of character and in contrast to the above) = Comms.

For some absolutely retarded fucked up reason, military and intel comms are also subject to Blackrock-style DEI race/gender "representation" (inversion) mandates.

It's hard to say if the true elites of the world are ignoring things, or simply paying them lip service knowing that the population has become too complex and disparate to fully control anymore. Globalism and DEI has been a knife in their own back it seems, but it could just be a tool to displace the blame onto their petite bourgeoise administrative class when shit truly hits the fan. I think you generally to best by your family and your fortunes but placing intermediaries between you and the actual happenings to be able to play coy/have plausible deniability. Even if a certain subsection of those below you understand who truly masterminded the demise, when the rubble has settled from the doomsday fallout, people will be too preoccupied or conflicted to listen to certain groups wanting to administer true justice. Life really is like a comic book in a lot of ways.

It's hard to blame the elites, really. If they had had the knowledge they have now about DNA and genetics, back in the pre scientific enlightnment era, maybe they would have practiced a more rigid eugenics, or at the very least continued their conquests of the lesser countries to prevent the mess we're in today. Imagine if they had gone on a 100 to 500 year conquest of the entirety of Africa. Instead we're stick with the legacy of jewish slavery and niggerball.

it's such a weird fucking agenda that subversion by a foreign adversary seems like the only reasonable explanation, like yuri bezmenov's famously explained
the biggest irony of this would be that many decades later, those same troons created by a dormant cold-war communist ideological virus are here today, 24/7, attacking the new regime that replaced the USSR, and doing NATO's bidding

Boomers were unironically ALWAYS like that. Just ask Gen X. They first refused to do so in order to prevent 'replacement' and later they did it to keep the prices high. Even when they were about to retire they STILL refused to train anyone. That is the real reason why it happened. It wasn't that millennials didn't want to get into the trades(even back then they made BIG BUCKS) but they couldn't because Boomers refusal(even for their own family) and Gen X not giving a fuck. So now when its Zoomers turn...they all suddenly go...wait a second where the fuck are all the tradies? Boomers are retired. Gen X still not giving a fuck. The rare few millennials who despite all odds got in are overworked and underpaid as hell or lazy overpaid fucks who know they cannot get replaced(ty Affirmative action and DEI). Zoomers take one look at this and go 'well sheeit nvm'.

The lack of labor in the trades is 100% self inflicted.

Affirmative Action came first and since it was the Fed who started it, it was the Fed who were affected first. What we are seeing is the Affirmative Action hires from back then getting wrongfully promoted, the old competent people retiring, and the new wave of incompetence getting hired to replace them(DEI). Legit the only 'competent' people they got left that aren't compromised is Gen X who is the smallest Gen and good luck getting those extremely nihilistic doomers to give a fuck. Keep in mind this isn't limited to just the government. Anything large enough had to abide by it.

>anti leftism
It's pretty simple: Since leftism like that is plain lunacy that is incompatible to objective reality and truth you can test for this. Integrate such tests into leadership positions, not as their own thing but as single questions or other content and never allow people failing a single one to take any leadership role. That's the same as the DEI crap they're currently doing but against their lunacy instead. The problem with society is that it doesn't detect and remove cancer, so it becomes very sick and eventually dies.
Without objective facts and truth a society becomes unable to point at, identify and solve any problems since reality is ignored, framed, falsified.

This is a stupid and juvenile way to view things. It boils down people to single issues. You can have people that are part of the ingroup but also calling out the bad things that are happening due to outgroups like immigration and outsourcing screwing over American workers. They could be doing "bad things" that are harmless to the ingroup. People in the outgroup could be doing good things that only benefit the outgroup like when Indian tech managers hire mostly other Indians or when Chinese steal tech from the US to bring "more people" but all of them Chinese "out of poverty". Sometimes things that are meant to be good are done in bad ways that causes more bad than good, like with many Democratic policies that's favored DEI. This is the so-called nuance they favored, but don't want to admit because it goes against their own world view assumptions that some are mistaken.

Indeed. I assume the journo is quite young. She is also a women. But even so, I think this afflicts the vast majority of these cretins. My speculation is that this because 'journalism' is now a career. Like working in Finance, or Engineering, or whatever. They get intern posts, then graduate roles, and eventually work their way up the corporation. Finance bods have to know about Finance. Engineering bods have to be Engineers. What do journos need to know? Idk. And of course working your way up the greasy poll is a complex business, where the most ambitious and ruthless do well. Also A-Type personalities will generally be more driven, which is fine. We now have DEI added to the mix, however, which will filter wrongthink.
Tucker dismissed her ruthlessly, and I bet she is the one who usually does that to her colleagues. She'll be smarting over that. That's not how it worked in Mad Men, where the sassy unconventially pretty junior copier chick is better than the men. Tears. Hook up with Brad from Marketing. Kek.

There is a Christian church in even the smallest village. Big enough just for one person, as that's all which is needed.
Easter is a massive deal out there.
They have DINGUS DAY.
"Easter Monday was a holiday called Dingus Day."
Watch the movie Operation Anthropoid. You can visit the church in the movie, it's in Prague, and has Sunday Mass.
Unfortunately Abrahamic religions have similar roots.
They hate browns so much. They'll call a nigger a nigger to its face.
They'll call a gypsy a dirty fucking gypsy.
Women are referred to as "monkeys", i.e. Monkey Business.
Check this out Muslim-fags, "How did Czechoslovakia get rid of communism?
On 27 November, a two-hour general strike involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia was held. In response to the collapse of other Warsaw Pact governments and the increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November that it would relinquish power and end the one-party state."
fucking based.
A hegemonous nation, united and strong.
DEI dividing them. Dividing you in your country.
Read these stats Muslim propagandists:
What is the religion of the Czech Republic?
Presently, 39.8% of Czechs consider themselves atheist; 39.2% are Roman Catholics; 4.6% are Protestant, with 1.9% in the Czech-founded Hussite Reform Church, 1.6% in the Czech Brotherhood Evangelic Church, and 0.5% in the Silesian Evangelic Church; 3% are members of the Orthodox Church; and 13.4% are undecided.

If anyone with a brain was in the US government, they would be setting up skill camps for young poor sexless NEETs where they could learn valuable skills like programming and maintenance for legacy systems throughout the country, automation for SMB, very basic welding or civic construction skills just so they can get gainful work, forestry, medicine, volunteering for various conservation and agricultural projects. Or forced state guard service, like paramilitary that can't be deployed and only exists to fight home grown terrorists/cartels/etc. Just a peaceful place in the middle of nowhere with low operating costs to get skills and get over whatever mental illness(es) they have. Internet courses, hands on training and government-backed certifications for trades or skills that employers can see the value in.

No need to import some smelly jeet to do GRC for megacorps, just train some NEET who hates globohomo and he will ruthlessly police them and their HR roasties. No need to train some OSHA mammy on how to enforce workplace regulations, find some ancap lolbert who can learn the importance of workplace safety and he will eventually overturn many of the stifling regulations while his kind NEET soul will give better and more genuine care for industrial and construction workers than some DEI retard ever even could.

You could do the same with femcels but focus more on nursing, child and senior care or whatever they show some aptitude at. This is something Teddy Roosevelt or one of our actually capable presidents would have done if confronted with this problem, back when capable political leaders were a thing. Blackrock and other asset managers don't actually want to fix this broken society, they make more money this way and collect more bailouts from the passive, mindbroken, increasingly impoverished public.

And they're Americans, in many cases founding stock like some families that stayed in the few livable southern and midwestern cities. So surely there is something we can do to de-snob them bros. Take the shitty values out and make them understand why we don't take kindly to their type.


Maybe like a three strike rule, where I won't key your shit and slash your tires on sight if you don't paint the sidewalk rainbow colored for gay sex week/month/etc or comply with DEI requirements like the rest of us.

unironically and categorically the ultra-rich are universally evil
if you gave me the fairly odd parents and all of the wishes I wanted (no monkey's paw/Bedazzled shit where you have to get grey hairs wording it exactly right to not blow up in your face), I'd end up with:
>5-10 acres of land
>modest house
>small woodworking/metalworking/machine shop
>all the tools I could imagine
>a flat range with a backstop on the property
>no taxes and no one to bother me

literally anyone who gets that rich does so because at one time they were an evil poor person, or were born an evil person of means.
no sane person wants to control other people, no sane person gets into politics, no sane person amasses such an amount of money that they start buying corporations to implement DEI, and certainly no sane person constantly hallucinates a mass of poor people "overthrowing" them
Musk, Gates, Fink, Biden, Trump, Jinpeng, Putin, Zelensky, Macron, Sunak, Buffett, Bezos: all of these people are fundamentally and at a base level, evil.

When you get that rich, you start fancying yourself as beside God, and not under Him. You start believing that you have a mission to "lead people" and "direct society." you engage in "philanthropy."

Just listen to any of them talk. They genuinely believe they have a hard job "directing society and leveraging human nature into something great."

Ancestral European religions fastest growing religions in the West! Anonymous ID:D5lHFRsM Wed 26 Jun 2024 11:45:47 No.472255091  Replies: 16 ViewReport
With the impending death of christjewery, Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend!

>1) Economically, with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>2) Politically, jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>3) Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

Like I really can't imagine making your post and thinking I was making some clever point. Giving White men even one ad like that does indicate some relaxation on the DEI agenda, yes.

Video games used to be made exclusivly by white men. They used to strive for technological advancement (Quake, Crysis, Metal Gear Solid) in them and trying to put very relevant l and topical themes (GTA or Deus Ex) into them.

This is why they are pushing the DEI nonsense. They don’t want these games to become more advanced simulators where you can test kit your ideas by playing them, modding them (learning programing skills) or participating in their communities (like making fan made GTA radio stations or story writing). They want video games to be like jewish Hollywood propaganda movies and not like high end simulators and kino top notch cinema because they are an under realized white entertainment and computer science accomplishment

They paraded Vivek around on The Daily Wire and other (((conservative))) shows trying to build popularity for the guy. He appeals to nobody in that crowd that have met Poojets irl. He said some tweets one time that got him some recognition but then disappeared because he lacks any organic support. The best part about this pick is that showing that Trump now supports the immigration and depressed wages, especially with the tranny beer and UFC debacle, has allow for the great redpilling that Trump was always a part of the swamp that is Blackrock domination. Once that is understood showing him as a supoorter of DEI is as easy as pointing to Larry's comments on wages.

Beautiful thing. Beautiful person. Pottery.

No. I was doing ML academics and I just discovered today two tiers of discrimination against me by a program that I was applying to with no other choice as it was to further my goals, directly in line with the DEI statements, yet a year later they take a girl of the same credentials, who I found just yesterday through a paper published that is less technical depth that I had applied with stating that is what I was going to do there, a year before that girl had gotten into the program. Wtf? I literally applied saying I wanted to build a better application than the richfag version they made of the subject.
They circumcised me, they cut off every academic growth, they prevent free thinking and free minds. They try to take everything from men. I will never participate again.

Main goal with these should be improving men’s quality of life. The damage feminism has done to this generation of women is permanent but I believe the next generation could be fixed when these social experiments all inevitably implode. However where does that leave today’s men? For many it’s already too late to have a family even if the culture changed overnight. So I think AI gfs are more like a palliative that would keep men from being exploited by their formerly chadsexual looksmatch when the free money for DEI finally runs out. Something to come home to after a day of fixing the (((problem))).

But they are not something that turns back time, most of us have to accept that ship has sailed and work towards giving future men the chance at a normal life. I would rather have the life my ancestors had when women and men were in balance. I love the idea of an AI gf because I’m a nerdy coomer with a vivid imagination but I know it’s cope, it’s not something to celebrate and shove in normies faces like some tranny would. If you want revenge on femcunts just being happy with your personal AI in her world is enough to drive them to insanity, the larping with a robot girl thing trying to physically and practically reenact the life you would have had is grim imo. Raising a kid with an artificial womb and a realistic robot isn’t going to be practically possible in anyone’s lifetime let alone while I’m still young so I find these threads and the anons who post here not really serious.

The course was eye opening, it was like 95% globohomo propaganda, 5% the actual subject matter (how to use GoogleDocs and Excel). DEI, troonism, feminism, refugee activism, abo worship, climate action, wealth inequity etc.

I was doing the course genuinely and answering correctly then realised that the assessors were marking "NOT SATISFACTORY" on answers which I didn't copy paste from their source, I would retype the same info with different words and the pajeet student coach would mark a fail with an attached comment to reread the source. Finished it all to get my activity point and then let it die, disgusting stuff. when I started skipping through everything and copy pasting answers, they were insta-passing

There's many problems with C-suite hiring at the moment. DEI and nepotism etc. Inflated salaries based on share performance that is a reflection of an over stimulated stock market rather than the fundemenatls of a company. And many companies are starting to face the consequence of this.
But in theory the salary of an executive relative to a laborer is justified. Maintaining the running of a complex system in a dynamic and ever changing environment is mkre difficult then operating a predictable piece of machinery. And the stakes are much higher. You need someone with the right educational background for the job, which often means that they had parents who were able to invest in their education. No one exists in a bubble. Our capabilites and opportunities are a product of our circumstance which is largely a product of our parents, and their parents before them. That just is what it is. And you can only sacrifice efficiency in the pursuit of fairness to a point before you start to get diminishing returns.

Jews. The world outside of pol thinks White-jew is not an oxymoron. So, they are befuddled to see that there is a huge emphasis on all the DEI shit, but yet "White-jews" are given extreme favoritism at the highest level when White people are actively discriminated against throughout the company.

To me, there is no contradiction in racial theory if you accept jews aren't White, and the jewish enemy wants all the lucrative societal positions for themselves and wants to harm White people as much as they can at every turn.

I think there needs to be a national discussion over the question, "Are jewish people White?". We need to settle this issue once and for all.

Rodney King/ OJ & Ruby Ridge/Waco

I think these were the incidents that made everyone on both sides realize that they live in two completely separate worlds with completely separate views on race, justice, what it means to be an American and reality itself. It was also around the same time of the politically correct bullshit, which, has morphed into the current dei madness. It proved too much for the average American’s psyche and we had a schizo split culturally.

Yeah that's not going to work. You're going to need some of them. You need to take the talent, leave the DEI. I wish I could go into strenuous detail, you want a soft landing for some of them if you want them to switch sides. Hard work, it's a life of pain that may never pay off, but you do it anyways. Just find a job you like, try your best to stay afloat and later turn that into a business. And catalogue your knowledge, spread it with any proteges you come across.

3.) Average white guy can't get scholarship to university, because no "muh DEI", needs a low wage unskilled job to self fund education that leads to skilled, high wage job.

When I was in it was just SHARP and EO and that was really gay.
There was also that resiliency shit where it felt more like a synanon attack therapy session because everybody would get mad at you for not having a fucked up life, "Soldier, please tell us how you faced and powered through adversity you've experienced in your life?"
That shit was really weird. I felt bad for the people making shit up so they wouldn't get yelled at by the S shop NCO fatties. They were just trying to get through it but even lying to skirt around that gay shit is acknowledging it's power over you.

depends on the grant. they apply to the canadian government with their scope of work listing their target audience/plan and they're allotted a certain amount to their organization to give companies grants for hiring certain people. usually it'll be something like % of training costs (first year salary can be considered a training cost) covered up to a maximum of x CAD (i've seen this range anywhere from 5k up to 55k CAD)
this is one company which applied for it and they were granted the ability to give 6.9k to companies who hire certain people to cover training costs:
https://apma.ca/dei-fund/
this one gets 90% of the first year salary of first nations covered up to 52.5k (35k for other eligible recipients of the grant):
https://nohfc.ca/en/pages/programs/people-talent-program/indigenous-workforce-development-stream

I've seen others back in 2022 where it's like 75% of your salary is covered if you're a women graduate in the past 2 years. and many targetted at newcomer new grads. companies exploit the shit out of these. it's hard to get hired if you're a canadian man just because of the presence of these things.

You can see a lot of them on websites like this:

Firefighters are overwhelmingly white. The non white one's are DEI hires who want a good paycheck and the clout. Simple as.

When you look up why it's all blamed on the racist white man who won't let Mr. Nigga risk his life to save people....kek. Yeah that must be it, it couldn't' be that blacks and browns have no empathy for anyone but themselves and their own personal family.

Guess what the largest majority race is in the Oakland Fire Department? A hot bed of nigger culture and where niggers are the largest racial category in the city. Whites are the main people in the Oakland FD and over represented vs the racial make up of the city. Blacks and browns serve in the Oakland FD in less percentages than their populations in Oakland. So in one of the blackest cities in America, with the least percentage of whites(25%), still has whites as the number one race in their fire department.

Or they'll curb DEI bullshit, or whatever. But none of what they do is dynamic, they remain static and on the defence. Instead, they should embrace the dynamic left in how they get shit done, they should deport tens of millions per year, enforce fundamentally pro-White policies in the same manner that DEI is enforced, they should go after everyone on the left, put them out of a job, destroy their lives, ruin their families and out-left the left.

But what are we left with? Reasonableness? Right-centrism?
Pretty much every right-winger of today is nothing more than a leftist from 10 or 20 years ago.

Best advice for getting into medicine right now: don't be a white man. Deck stacked so incredibly hard against you.

DO programs don't play the DEI games as badly as MD programs do though, and will likely be seen as the preferred degree in 10 years or so because so many MDs are going to be low-IQ nogs with no deductive reasoning skills. There's a very real and looming competency crisis about to hit.

The U.S. Justice System today is a joke and completely subverted by Israel.
The U.S. Attorney General holds the highest deciding power of who to prosecute and who to not.

Let me tell you a story:
So, in the 1940s there was this Jewish couple, the Rosenbergs, who stole atomic secrets and smuggled them to the Judeo-Bolshevik USSR, which led to USSR having the atomic bomb. They were ultimately caught in 1950. The U.S. AG at the time was J. Howard McGrath, an American. The Rosenbergs were charged for treason, found guilty in a trial, and executed.
Fast forward to 1960s, there was another Jewish man, Zalman Shapiro, the president of Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) of the U.S., who stole atomic secrets and materials, including ready-made weaponized enriched uranium, and smuggled them to Israel, which led to Israel having the atomic bomb.
Shapiro was caught in 1976 but never stood trial for his crimes, in fact absolutely nothing happened to him, the whole incident was swept under the rug, and Shapiro continued to live in the U.S. for the rest of his days like it didn't even happen.
Why? What changed between 1950 and 1976?
Well, the U.S. AG has the power to decide who to prosecute or not. So even though Shapiro was guilty of treason, the U.S. AG at that time, Edward Hirsch Levi, declined to prosecute him.
Why?! Shapiro committed treason and Levi just let him off, just like that?! How can one man be guilty of treason and simply be let off like nothing happened, while others get executed for it?
>Levi was the first Jewish Attorney General of the United States.
Ohh...now it all makes sense.

Your current US AG is also not an American, but Jewish, Merrick Garland. Think about that.
The Jews have been replacing Americans in every position of power in the USA for decades.

Designed by the Jews.
There aren't enough Jews to fill every position of power so anti-white DEI has been designed so they can fill the position with their nigger golems.

DEI award winner, a nigger woman, is a judge and lies off her face.
There should be a law that positions which are expected absolute honesty by the public, like judges and cops, if caught on a lie in ANY setting should be jailed immediately and never allowed to enter public service again.
Or just deport all non-whites and go back to high-trust of white society.
Non-white people corrupt and turn to shit everything they touch.
Why are cops and judges not corrupt in white countries but they are so in black and brown ones?
You should never allow non-whites in white society.

no. what 100% happened was that twitch was salty about Dr's big exclusive twitch contract after mixer shut down. it was a pointless contract that was costing them too much money. Dr wasn't a communist, black or a woman either so no point in keeping him around for DEI. so the twitch execs ordered the furry admins to look for a reason to ban him to void the contract. they found that he messaged he a "minor" years prior and decided to see if they could run with that. Dr sued them and they realized they had no case because either Dr wasn't the one doing the sexting or the minor couldn't be found IRL to turn on the doc. so twitch was forced to settle and pay the contract in full and doc went to YT to stream.

I guarantee you that is what happened. it's the only thing that makes logical sense.

Both sides are staffed with jews at the helm.

We get to find out in July whether or not Trump pics AIPAC funded Vance or a Jew, or DEI--whether he is going to help us, or finish us off. It's up for grabs.

MAGAQtards are going to lose it, they're convinced JFK JR is going to be his VP. Trump says his pick will be at the convention.

Either way, it looks like we lose. There's zero way VANCE is NOT AIPAC chosen. He came from no where and OH is the sleeper state of Jew control. No way he got to take Portman's seat without being on Team Jew.

Portman was bent af. That's why he resigned.

It is helpful to the Jews in inviting a parasitic class to DEI into important positions that hate Muslims and worship Jews and do not have sympathy for the suffering of White people and cry racism, even when Indians rape and kill or molest White girls.
I've heard Jews on here gushing at how much they love Indians and how they cause us problems. And the Indian will never rebel against the Jews as long as they are pro-Indian immigration and support them against the majority.
Like in empires past, they use ethnic intermediaries to manage an occupation regime that is parasitic against the local population.

Even the Chinese immigrants aren't even remotely half as bad as the Indians, though I am for an ethnostate, of course.

> For all the talk of growth, the economy is here completely suborned to the bigger constitutional battle. The economic idea of Starmerism is that no politician should be permitted to take economic decisions. All “fiscal events” are to be submitted to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for its approval, which will create an effective veto. Economic advisory bodies are split, merged, and closed all the time, but such is the hostility to any kind of executive power that new institutions like the ‘Industrial Strategy Council’ are to be put on an actual statutory footing.
>mmigration and energy will follow a similar course. Starmer has pledged to “strengthen” the Migration Advisory Council (MAC). Given how loathe Rishi Sunak has been to ignore its recommendations, we can only assume that a beefed-up version of the MAC will have almost complete discretion over Britain’s immigration policy. Great British Energy, like NHS England (created by the Coalition’s health reforms), will simply take over this area of policy. It will be able to ignore direct orders from ministers, just as NHS England ignored Brandon Lewis’s order to stop hiring DEI consultants.
>The military is also be put at the disposal of international law, rather than the civilian government. It is yet unclear what shape the ‘Prevention of Military Intervention Act’ will take, but it will almost certainly require the executive to make a ‘lawful case’ for any military action it undertakes. Similarly, the Legacy Act which protects Northern Ireland veterans from prosecution is to be repealed.

its funny. jews going in with the GIs and showing the average american how soldiers were dying like dogs in the jungle was one of the main motivators for getting everyone to revolt against the draft. And since vietnam, the government has been very very careful about showing dead soldiers of either side, always dressing up stories of the war in a clear good versus evil framework, always heavily publicizing war crime cases and punishing regular soldiers for overt looting/harrassing of civilians. But the ukrainians, brand new to the 21st century, didnt understand that and neither did their DEI handlers whose political policy is to never say no to a friend. They think they can demoralize the enemy by showing people dying, they think they can prove they are some how winning by bragging about killing individual soldiers, but in reality what they are doing is demoralizing themselves and disgusting their allies.

A blue hole is substantially harder, than just trying to go down to that depth in the open ocean.
There are the precipitous sides of the hole (which are jagged and sharp as fuck, as underwater sinkholes are formed out of coral limestone or carbonate bedrock that gave way and eroded in the past ice ages when these holes were exposed to the air to experience weathering) that if their pringle can sub or it's wiring hits just a little harder than a bump, its fucking done; sediment that can be disturbed to obscure vision, and this one is so deep that they'll be in darkness for a good portion of it if they are trying to reach the bottom; there are caverns and caves located around the edge walls of the holes, with this one, Dean's Blue Hole, having "the second largest known underwater cave room and may be the ninth largest cave room in the world; and the volume of water displaced during a tidal cycle indicates that significant cave passages may connect to the blue hole" meaning that there may be currents or jets and things to further disorient and make safe operation in the hole an issue.
There are a lot more challenges to diving in a confined and unique environment that underwater sinkholes present, that's why they are some of the hardest places to go scuba diving, and they result in the most diving deaths per specific diving locations any where in the world.
Going there in a purposely cheaply made plastic tube that requires wiring to the surface to operate, is literally spelling out your doom and asking for a number of things to go wrong.

>Leaving aside the concept of Equity, which is just straight up Communism with no other nuance to it at all, supporting both Diversity and Inclusion at the same time also makes zero sense.
In reality, all the concept of DEI is Communistical as possible.
The antagonistic natures of Diversity and Inclusion as you analyze are just a Contradiction in a dialectical process, or at least as marxists' interpretation of Hegel's dialects.
The objective is destroying any metric that involves observable and verifiable values, namely production and efficiency.
But you shoild ask yourself, why would any businessman implement such dumbfuckery?, what it would improve in the workplace?
It us implemented because as already proven, in environments with human "Diversity", there is LOWER mutual trust, or at least in a first moment.
The "Inclusion" guarantees that that "first moment" distrust br clndtantly maintained, as there is always some more corrosive category of creature to bring to the workplace environment, to complete the envisioned corporate human petri dish.
In this way the workers can't organize themselves, and being in such atomization, become easily manipulable by their bosses, that maintains your wages lower than if the workplace was ethnic homogeneous, and had no psychiatric lgbt nutcases.
If you complain about the DEI and that it creates a hostile workplave environment, they'll pressure you to either quit or have a nervous breakdown that will justify y/our firing.
DEI is basically a prove that both Communism and Capitalism are just sides of a same coin, that they have a profound common nature, the economical materialistic worldview.

The lies are piled so high that there is no truth that can be discerned. Something has an agenda and it runs various psyops to herd us rats into the mazes they need run.

They want DEI for some reason we can only guess so we get that. We can guess at the reasons, but we will never know.

This is true. Speaking as a teacher in Texas, I'll tell you that the worst thing that most students face is not coming from activist teachers. Those are rarities, actually. The worst thing is DEI forced on districts from the state's Education Service Centers that do staff training, certification, and all the accountability stuff for the state. The Texas DoE has no accountability to anyone except to themselves, as long as the state legislature isn't breathing down their necks and they know it. It's all appointed jannies.

It's a thorougly artificial phenomenon, it was not accepted, DEI usurped financing companies and so anyone who wants a loan to make a stupid capeshit movie or game has to go along with it.
It's not gonna last tough, no matter how much they believe in their message, if the product doesn't sell there's no way to pay back the loan.

Simple
Kids were brainwashed by cultural Marxists determined to take down America and playing the long game
Corporations/Wall Street wanted to distract from their fuckery (like using derivatives to fuck over every American regarding EVERYTHING)
So they developed a scheme where instead of being Occupy Wall Street against them
They can pander to corporations and give them money/loans if they do what they say

Be movie, game developer, or some store
Need money to make game or movie or buy merchandise for your store
Try to take out loan
Get shit terms
The big Blackrock's and shit who are close to money creation trough at the Fed can capitalize on their position and make offers others can't because they are subsidized by the money printer goes brrrrrr
Companies go 'Wow!', if we agree to do DEI/ESG shit we get a huge discount and maybe even 0 percent loans
Companies go woke
Interest rates start going up
Now they can only survive off woke money
So they can go broke from loans or go broke from destroying their IP's/brand name
They decide on the latter, it's slower, and they think... hey it might not happen at all if we brainwash enough people

There you go
That's what happened

It's also possible that they're somehow being subsidized. Maybe some covid-era loss-covering program for businesses, or something analogous to DEI payoffs, but for companies who agree to keep prices high. I am just theorizing, and have no evidence for any of this, but you are correct that the most apparent reasonable thing to do would be to lower prices, which isn't happening.

Games have gotten worse because game developers are shittier, and they're shittier because companies are hiring people based on DEI policies, and they're doing this to appease investment firms like Blackrock and Vanguard which are forcing them to. apparently there's a lot of science and business related benefits to dei hiring
obviously you dont need to pay employees as much
you have a stronger hold on workculture, potential unionization etc
and it makes people easier to replace

the gaming industry is a disgusting cesspool of garbage because of this.

Money from the cash cows. All the monetary incentive and forceful agenda are investiments - that won't give any return - but companies on the brink are wetting themselves about the credits in the short term, at the expense of their business on the long run, poisoning their ranks with DEI on every level. And for those that are not on the brink, the very corporate environment was infested of fresh employees right from the universities, where this shit brews and they live in an hyper reality of values and stakes of their own that do not translate in the real world. All this is on the monetary cycle and will comeback crashing in the next years, when the bill will be charged.

I don't think international Jewry even believes in anything, (except their freemasonic deity maybe) they don't have any ideology at all.
Kikes didn't invent capitalism or socialism, but they successfully infiltrated both. When it suited them, they implemented some elements of communism (the ugliest ones) to further weaken and divide the cattle.
But that's it, it's not like they're going to wave a huge hammer and circle over the White House or outlaw private property. Just more sodomy, more DEI, more insanity, to exclude even a hypothetical possibility of organized uprising.

It's all fake. In the last 5 years I have has three job changes, each one at a progressively more technically challenging industry. The people are much smarter and friendlier as the IQ goes up, it is expected. It's not easy being this nice to people when you have conflicts inherent in business, but it creates a different work environment. You simply see less color as the difficulty level goes up because the creativity is impossible to fake, and it demands a brain structure that can imagine things that don't exist yet, via abstraction. These companies cannot afford not to hire the very best they can get. As for the DEI, you give it lip service but the reality of it is companies are going to get the best they can. or they will suffer.

Every single time there is a white person with a nonwhite that means there is one less white person in the dating pool to make white babies.

There is constant propaganda promoting racemixing everywhere you look. DEI/ESG shit in the workplace has made white males very unnattractive to hire and nonwhites and white women attractive to hire. This makes it harder for white males to get ahead and gives nonwhites opportunity to be around white women.

How could you not be worried if you were a white man?

I am trying to put this in very simple terms so that you understand.

So yes they should make white babies, but they are also right to rail against racemixing. Not just with white women but white men also

The media plays a huge part in the replacement rate. Women wanted families because of film. Men wanted love because of music. My parents named me and my sister after Characters in The Man From Snowy River, for fuck's sake. We then started censoring out sex scenes, then even happy families all together. Taxi Driver reads like a family film compared to all the strewn trash all over streaming now. Part of the media's problem right now (such as Warner's debt) may actually be tied not only to DEI wasted funds but also to lack of government funding for not instilling concepts such as pro-war and pro-procreation enough in their media. The pill to swallow here is that the media DOES affect us, and not having a monoculture anymore is affecting even positive aspects of attempted government programming. Nobody watches the news or listens to the radio anymore. More people can bond over a TikTok dance than a new song that nobody ever listens to. This is the real reason government hates TikTok so much but they can't say it out loud.

Skimmed over the article - and while I won't dispute that China has grown in this regard over the years, what has changed about the West in the last 20 years?
>Scientific study stiffled due to rampant politisation of fields
>The best/brightest are not being granted scholarships/positions; instead, nepotism and DEI is enforced both at the academic and professional level
>General economic and living standards have declined across the board; turns out, a decrease in motivation can result in lower productivity, even at the academic level
The answer is a complex one. But the shortest explanation is that the West is already seeing the birth of a competency crisis - and that won't be changing anytime soon. And while China is facing an upcoming demographic catastrophe due to the One Child Policy implemented back in the day, they still retain the population & political authority to forcefully drive progress in specific areas of their society.

But, as history frequently shows, such "forced marches" rarely maintain their momentum.

Capitalism (kike name for the consensual, free exchange of goods and services) supplied all that and more. It unfortunately ceased being capitalism when kikes got their hooves on the money printers and detached the currency from any tangible meaning, and after enriching themselves went full mask off and decided to control the entire economy and culture by printing and giving this currency to companies who adhered to their DEI policies. Calling this capitalism is obviously disingenuous, but it is the reasoning they push as to avoid blame themselves. So, good little kike messenger!

It's not just one motive, Bruce. They can pursue profit above all else while simultaneously serving their more nefarious and underhanded ends, too.
The good news is that incompetence, on a long enough time scale, is a self-correcting problem, so you really need to focus on the top of the pyramid so the bottom can start to sort itself out.

OP is a STEMcel who couldn’t get laid in college and is now bitter that the Chad who fucked his oneitis is his boss now and blames all finance Chads for his life being shitty. It’s called working smarter, not harder, you think slaving away for Mr. Shekelberg will make you successful? Finance Chads just game the system by creating shitty startups then abandoning them when DEI shit inevitably makes them go under and move on to the next project. Turns out having social skills and decent looks gets you further in life than being a book smart but ultimately ugly and asocial nerd. Just work harder and maybe you’ll make enough money to get a crumb of pussy LOL.

I'm seriously thinking their DEI crew had a nigger moment and command realized they had better get that particular crew out of harms way before they do take a major hit. A real hit on a carrier would not likely be covered up. That would be great propaganda to push the war way harder. Possibly test out an ICBM, even. This trouble is something home grown.

Mostly right. They're jews and their DEI pets, not finance fratbros. Still, the economy is being ran by people who lied on their reusme.
You left out the worst part though. The way jews have have modified financial laws, primarily the fed and fractional reserve banking, breaks the normal capitalist feedback loops and insulates them from the consequences of their own bad decisions. It's created a kind of economic Fisherian runaway where investments can be profitable not because they actually produce value, but because they produce future investments.

Checked, and you do have a good point there too.
The Jews once again might have pushed it a bit too far and overplayed their hand.
Lot of people I know have already checked out modern media and watch older movies and TV series instead.
But on the other hand, box office revenues haven't budged and movies are doing good and so are streaming services.
When I look at the "top 10 in finland" category in Netflix it's all DEI bullshit, so that would imply that zoomers and/or gen alpha are consooming this tranny bullshit like its their favorite slop.
Of course it could also be just Jewish psyop and consensus building to put the DEI shit in the Top 10 to make it seem like that this is what people in your country like, Jews understand the power of conforming to society really well, and they know tricking people to think "yes everyone else actually loves immigrants and jews, its just you who are different and thus should be more like others and stay quiet".
It's very hard to tell what is true and what is not in this Jewish age of disinformation.
I'm an oldfag millenial though and lot of things seem to point at the fact that only us and older zoomers are maybe waking up but younger zoomers and beyond are fully onboard on the gay and tranny train.
Probably exactly the discord the Jews want to sow to get the natives infighting instead of checking out what the Jew is scheming in the background.
It's very hard to tell of the future, are we going to be able to go against the Jew or is going to be entirely Jewish with no hope of removing them from power until everything is fully poisoned and lost forever, our nations becoming non-white and white culture is gone forever.

Seems like it. Happens with IQ. They'll use Jews or Asians and suddenly they're just smarter and better than Europeans. Their culture is better. When a European says that, it's racist and everyone is equal, but suddenly when a European is being racist, everything goes out the window. It's extremely obvious it has nothing to do with combating racism and everything to do with undermining. That's why we saw the ivy league college admission thing in the news.
>>471846059

This works because they can pit Asians against Europeans, even though it's Jewish. European Americans are hit from all angles. We're not a protected class, so everyone can take precedence over us. Asians didn't have that problem. Discrimination against European Americans, which is what DEI is, is par for the course. We can't complain and point out how ridiculous it is without being seen as racist.

It's all designed to undermine. There are tons of examples of Jews supposedly being the voice of reason and siding with non European Americans. It happened in real life and it's depicted in the media a lot. The Jewish American is the misunderstood intellectual who shows compassion and the European American is the asshole. Constant reiteration that Jews know what it's like to be persecuted. It's very arrogant. They act as the experts on that stuff and throw up their hands, like there's no reason for people having problems with them.

This type of thing is so pervasive and it seeps into everyone's heads. We've been growing up with this propaganda. It will be a while before European Americans won't be associated with racism. The Karen meme is an example. There's so many soft examples to silence people. Diversity means non European. Supporting family as a European American means nepotism. Doing the same as a non Euro is celebrated and encouraged. It goes beyond being less racist. It's all to undermine European Americans. Interestingly enough, it picked up steam and has been snowballing after WW2.

As you can see, every Jewish admission office fucks over whites in favor of everyone else, but especially Jews.
The right side is the graph you should be looking at, which is the one relative to their ability. If race wasn't taken into consideration, all those bars should be at 100% on equally high standing.
Luckily in my country we don't (yet) have the DEI bullshit on university admissions and it's still purely meritocratic, meaning that people are admitted on test scores only.
Of course this leads to the situation that unis are almost 100% white because whites are the best race.

MacDonald talks specifically about "verbal intelligence", it's true that in IQ tests which measure pattern recognition/logical thinking, they do measure worse than average.
SAT scores is the best tool to compare averages between races, and Jews score slightly higher than average in Reading/Writing, but lower in everything else.
They are of very different intellectual character than Europeans. Ashkenazi Jews in particular have above average verbal IQ but pretty pathetic everything else. They're great with word games, trickery, deception, and not so much with visuo-spatial thinking and understanding. That's why you see so many Jew lawyers yet almost 0 mechanical engineers.
Jews are only over-represented in elite schools where the entry is not determined in meriocratic fashion (purely by test scores) but where the admission offices determine it in DEI fashion.
Those admission offices are staffed by Jews so they push in Jews at over 20x the rate of Whites, stealing spots from higher achieving Whites to give them to lower achieving Jews.
Everything a Jew touches becomes a Jewish racket.

Any job that can be done as WfH was never a real job in the first place.

Its irrelevant whether the cubicles are all in one building or scattered in individual apartments on a laptop. They still both achieve nothing.
They were an economic pyramid scheme of making the economy larger without actually achieving greater production.
The Industrial Revolution hit its practical limit, then the cheaper way to make 'growth' was by adding make-work on top.

Jews are definitely a direct obstacle for high verbal IQ whites, because they lock down all industries where verbal IQ is the prime factor by rising to the top and then shutting out white men
White women end up becoming the middle management in those fields because of DEI and because women generally have slightly higher verbal IQs than men
Nonverbal IQ industries have less Jewish influence because Jews have lower nonverbal IQs to start with, which is why people now believe that STEM was always superior to other industries

From now on, no more niggers in games. I don’t give a shit about that one nigger character that was “cool”. Shut up and die nigger lover, they did what they were designed for, pave the way for this current nigger fest demonic amalek mess, the DEI aka DIE whites garbage .

DEI is going to go away in a flash, it'll be like it never existed at all. It's because white people no longer want to be associated with black people in as a common species, and wish them to be designed as "other" in meaningful, economic and political ways. And they're also Bigots, which means they don't wish to change their opinion about it once you throw more armies of Sodomite Jews from Syria-Palestina into everyones faces over the magic glowing rectangles.

The Cain 666 Beast Nephalim and Sodomite Hashem-Believers simply have to return home safly and soundly to their native ancestral lands in Jordan and Egypt and Iran. There they can make Goys and Shiksas of the beasts of the field there.

With the impending death of christjewery (bolshevism 1.0), Ancestral European religions are poised to become a mega trend!

>1) Economically, with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>2) Politically, jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>3) Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

Didn't think about it like this. I am disabled. I have bipolar disorder and have been to the loony bin twice. There's no accommodations for me but it is a disability and I was very debilitated after my last hospitalization , it took me ~1yr to get back on my feet. I thought I might have to neet. It's listed as one of the federally recognized disabilities. If I apply for a government job is it better if I say I'm disabled? At my last two jobs no one in HR asked me about it or what my disability is. I didn't specify I just clicked the box that said I'm disabled.
I hadn't considered any of this before, I think I will still select disabled. I also don't want to tell my employer I have bipolar disorder because they might think I'm crazy or will do something crazy and then maybe they don't want to hire me.
Have they ever asked you to disclose your disability?

Instead, digressing to force and violence to get their way. This is why you're going to see the Jews start getting rid of DEI, not because it's not working, but because it's working too well. All the Racist Bigots from before, who wished to Give Israel and the Jewish Polyergus Dictatorship special privileges {holocaust et. al} believe that this polyergus has earned an expulsion from membership to human civilization. And that membership to the human species is more than just the ability to breed. Donkeys and horses can breed, but they are not the same species. Humans are exactly the same way.

As a White man who presents competently, it's a gamble going after a lot of jobs period, but if you add in the disposition of your prospect toward disabilities, it is another roll of the dice. If you look on forums where people talk about disabilities, you will see it is a common problem for them to determine whether or not to even disclose their condition.

I am disabled also, and though you can't tell by looking at me, my condition is very inhibiting, so for me, I need to make that dice roll because I have to ask for reasonable accommodations.

I would break it down this way: Is this employer going to value me considerably more if I check a DEI box, or is it one where your employer simply values your productivity and reliability above all else? If it's the former, claim a disability; if it's the latter, keep it to yourself. My 2 cents.

It's not; the point of this whole thread is about how it's pilot error upon being told the go ahead to visually approach and take the autopilot off (The OP mention of Boeing was probably bait to get people like you).
The fact that they are trying to hide the name is telling of this being a DEI competency crisis type situation.
Whether it was a Boeing aircraft or not doesn't matter, as no matter how you feel about that company, it makes no difference how well a plane is made, if the pilot is just going to crash it into the fucking ground because they got their license and job through political pampering and not through the once long dead meritocracy and standards for all we once had.

One of the last threads here >>471693661 , has some good info via catbox links and articles.

What's telling, is that it was only done through the FBI (no state or local police present at the raid; i.e. it is a strictly federal matter and investigation, so maybe they don't trust the locals/were worried about tip offs) and they had a court ordered warrant to search at 4 of her properties, and chose this one first (i.e. part of a wider and ongoing investigation where they know what they are looking for, where they are making sure that they are checking all the right boxes for further legal actions).
This post here >>471698589 , has a good webm of the agents leaving the property. There were around 15/16 agents total, just in that webm, and a good number of them were women.
This may be highly speculative of me, by I believe the high amount of women are there because they are more related to the cybercrime/sex crimes/human trafficking side of things (some fatties and not field operationally fit agents among those present at the raid; so they are more of the lab and office bound side of investigatory work), as male agents would be more fit and more likely to be related to the more dangerous and physically active side of their investigative branches.
Or it could all just be telling of how bad the DEI and selective hiring has gotten in the FBI; as I was heavily reminded by that "you're so extreme owowo; did you get the fertilizer :)" meme pic with the valley girl looking agent, when seeing all those young ladies leaving the house.

Regardless of instruments issues or autopilot, any competent pilot on a visual approach would have known they were way the fuck off course before getting down to 400 feet agl no where near the airport.

I think the turning point when all the tranny shit really started to get pushed by Jewish interests was after they squashed and memory holed the Occupy Wall St. movement.
When people protested against the (((bankers))), that one hit a bit too close to home for the Jews as it's only a small step from going against the (((bankers))) to discovering the JQ.
So they turned their Jewish media machines propaganda level to 11 and started to shill divisive shit like pro-lbtq+ pro-trannyism anti-family anti-white pro-nigger pro-spic pro-DEI shit fucking everywhere so instead of normies occupying wall street, the jews would occupy the normies minds instead, give them something else to think about.
That's literally been Jews tactic always, they sow discord and division and conflict to make the fingers point away from the Jews and to also make sure white nationalism doesn't rise ever again.
In fact, the Jews who have taken over the U.S. judiciary have designated white nationalism as TERRORISM last week
>https://www.state.gov/terrorist-designations-of-nordic-resistance-movement-and-three-leaders-2/
That's how concerned Jews are about the opposition, they are literally jailing it now and preventing it from functioning.
Jewish nationalism and Zionism of course is fine, AIPAC makes sure of this,
As is nationalism of any other ethnicity
It's just White nationalism which is illegal

This is really the bombshell that the media on the right should be focusing on.
Not because it reaches across the aisle to victimize mixed race instead of just white males but because it exposes the moving of the goal post to include people of color and standardizing them based only on the color of their skin and not on their qualifications.
It exposes the destruction of meritocracy by corporate entities and puts DEI policy on blast in a way that activates everyone's almonds, left and right.

If you have to have insurance, at least get insurance with a barebones mutual insurance company that doesn't have a lot of overhead costs like DEI out the ass (Nationwide)

They're like credit unions, and the company is owned by the policyholders. If you have a policy with a mutual insurance company, then you're one of the owners. Whenever your insurance company has a good year, you get paid interest on your stake in the company and you can use that to offset some of your insurance costs.

I understand that some people want to pay the insurance Jew. And if you're going to do it, then at least use mutual insurance. They're also mostly cheaper than for profit insurance companies.

they are really really trying to made "spreading disinformation" a criminal offense, aren't they?
the EU's "democracy shield" automated censorship thing, and this past week Bourla and Hotez were bringing back the comparison between vaccine denial and holocaust denial.

lots of pro-israel sources calling for people who spoke out about palestine to be criminally liable recently too. they are scared shitless because their lies are losing their power.

the funniest thing to me is that this mis/dis/malinformation-as-criminal-offense narrative started in the leftist academy with the intersectional feminism/critical theory assertion that, since texts are alive, then words are constitute literal acts of violence

idk maybe i'm just weird but it's funny to me that french communist philosophers from the 60s and 70s are now having their ideas used to justify state repression of dissent. similar to HR DEI officers being the new commissars. clown world man, everything is upside down

Ancestral European religions fastest growing religions in the West! Anonymous ID:J00QzKKB Thu 20 Jun 2024 15:23:07 No.471720868  Replies: 15 ViewReport
With the imminent death of christjewery, Ancestral European religions are about to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

both sides are fake and gay and astroturfed and this here mongolian squaredancing forum populated by we few, we happy few retards, provides exactly the plausible deniability the spooks and feds need to engineer a cultural breakdown and eventual low-intensity conflict (in order to avoid an actual organic grassroots populist uprising, create a fake one and manage both sides)

The bankers the dictator jew is selling the country off to want niggers and muslims to flood into Ukraine though the selling off of Ukraine is pretty funny since they're listing property in territories that they don't control so I guess another way that you can put it is that the Ukrainian government was given a button that provides $1 million every time it's pressed, but when it is pressed 1000 people die.

I meant faster. Because usually it takes too much time. The people involved treat it like an extension of their uni institute. The bureaucratic mentality, the work-life balance, the vanity and office politics, asking too much for permission, trying to appeal to the wrong people, aiming at the wrong markets even. Too many don't develop a product that's thrown into reality and receives harsh feedback but a company that exists on tech transfer subsidies. Have you seen the academic tech transfer scene? It's all about insurance, grants, keyword gaming to conform to the current thing. Often advised by the same kind of DEI roasties that would sit in HR or run the uni's social media account otherwise.

We should be more specific. Instead of saying the jews, we should figure out which jews in particular and call them by name. Like Larry Fink. Fuck that guy in particular. Not because he's a jew, but because he's an asshole. I hate him for his actions and that's ok. It's not a hate crime to hate an asshole who does asshole things.

It has to be definancialized. Theres too many bad monetary incentives in academia to the point that any true science and education is not possible for lack of funding.
Specific problems that I see:
>Most cutting edge research is funded by either big pharma or DoD/defense contractors
>Alumni/endowment funds have WAY too much power over school operations
>Atheletics money is a cancer upon true academic pursuits, schools become more leisure and partying based institutions than an academic one
>DEI cultism is too entrenched in everything to have balanced schools of thought. I.E you have to gobble cock in order to become a part of the institution itself.
>Guaranteed tuition money from the government removes all incentive to provide a good education
>Some larger universities, especially in smaller towns, have a near monopoly on local labor, institutions, culture, and economic development
>Academic resources are often expensive and inaccessible unless you pony up absurd amounts of money (think like specialized softwares or books for classes).
>The undergraduate cycle and churn slowly hollows out local non university institutions and traditions.
>Boards of trustees and democratic process is inaccesible and unaccountable
>More money is spent on optical marketing tactics than academics (fancy new furniture or amenities)

There’s a hundred threads every day complaining about DEI & forced illegal immigration; let’s assume I’m versed in those topics. Absent of that input, what can be done to remedy the state of higher education? I’m not particularly keen on the survival of America since it’s a lost fucking cause.

So the models work? If they models didn't work and the people checking them weren't in on it, then someone at some point would say something.

2.
The thermosphere is almost a vacuum. Yes, the gas is very hot, but there's so little of it that the satellites can radiate the heat away before it does damage.
Also, you're severely underestimating how much space is up there. Once a satellite is in orbit, it will stay there until something moves it. Most don't have thrusters, so they will stay in their orbit for years until they deorbit due to the tiny amount of drag.

3.
We can measure gravity. We can see gravity bend light. Any mass creates gravity. Try making an electric charge without an electron - you can't because it's a nonsensical statement. The forces and their carriers are inseparable. They've done many experiments on this exact thing.
We can walk because gravity is the weakest force.
Helium balloons float because that's how buoyancy works. Heavy things sink and light things rise. Helium is lighter than oxygen and nitrogen, so it rises.

4.
There's nothing I can say about this, it's just schizo ramblings.

5.
Yes, there is probably a lot of waste in NASA. They're probably spending most of that money on pointless projects, DEI hires, and bureaucracy.

Birth rates have been declining in most countries of the world since the end of WWII. My theory is that it's not just women education, but a multitude of factors (thus why it's so hard to fix):

>women entering the work force and being able to pursue careers
>rise of microplatics and endocrine disruptors lowering fertility
>post-1968 feminism and destruction of nuclear family unit
>huge surplus of economic production (food, entertainment, material wealth in general) due to automation leads to "easier", more comfortable lives and doesn't require two people getting together to survive
>fearmongering and brainwashing by world leaders (pandemics, DEI, climate change, end of oil etc) makes people not want to have children
>lack of housing to make a family

This is why even with all the measures the Orban government has taken to increase the birth rate, it hasn't budged by even 1%.

Even when they rule US cities they run into the same trouble. The first black city is a literal crumbling wasteland now. I forgot it’s name even. Some place everyone forgot. The few remaining residents scavenge for old canned food and hut rats like a Fallout game. But it’s right here in the US.


Blacks cannot build or maintain what we have built. Period. They are mostly violent retards.

whereby middle management practiced narcissistic behavior in the past, the advent of work from home and cutting middle management has been a great blow to psycopaths.
my take away from /pol is that anonymity is an actual solution to the problems found in the workplace and politics.
if you were to scramble your name in any work or politics related endeavor, interpersonal problems would disappear HR would disappear even this DEI and also racism all boiled down to the merit of the idea. you have no idea who it came from and you have no idea who is who to muster any type of consensus with anyone so that you can change the perception about the source of ideas.
either this or we fucking give psychopath tests at the job interview or use AI to sus out niggers in the workplace

They are only concerned that white men, especially the types that could become the next Verner Von Brauns, might get inspired and make more fun stuff. It's why the powers that be are so hot for DEI bullshit. The plot twist is Indians and East Asians are upstaging Jewish Gloaters all over the world and might become very disobedient in the next few decades. Jewish Vanity still can't bear to let white people reproduce with each other.

Boeing's failure seems a lot more interesting than just simple DEI niggerisms causing issues. Boeing is not an independent company, they're glowie central run straight from langley and the pentagon. They don't hire ordinary niggers, they exclusively hire niggers of the glowing variety. This means the FAA, congress, and the news media especially don't touch them, under ANY circumstances. The fact that there are so many issues popping up itself kind of implies they've lost this immunity. You'd never even hear of it before, even giant fuckups.

I can help answer this.
The Establishement, institutions ad businesses have toned down their ESG/DEI/Woke propagadizing, mostly because it has been losing in popularity.
From 2004/2008 to 2022, Leftist talking points about Gay Rights, Wokism, muh Racial Justice, Tranny Rights, were very popular, but since then the pendulum has started swinging the other way, and investors, among others, have seen the writing on the wall.

The best example of this is Larry Fink, CEO of Black Rock, abandonning ESG/DEI. For proof or further reading :
https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/blackrocks-fink-says-hes-stopped-using-weaponised-term-esg-2023-06-26/

Why is Larry Fink / Black Rock important?
Not only does Black Rock manages tons of money (of other people/businesses) as they are an investment firm, they also made the software Aladdin, which is used by investors to do a sort of enhanced Google search to determine if it would be a good idea to invest in these companies. Black Rock controls 10 Trillion $ and Aladdin controls 41 trillion $.
On that software, ESG played an incredibly important role in rating companies based on their level of Wokeness.
For reference, Tesla had a low score, despite being a electric car company, directly contributing/leading the fight against pollution, because of Elon Musk being naughty and not woke.
On the other hand, energy/oil companies like Shell, Total, Exxon, Chevron, had high ESG scores because they posted gay shit on their Twitter for Pride month and such, despite destroying the environment with massive oil spills directly in the ocean killing tons of wildlife.

This is why since 2018, woke shit was being pushed by companies, like Netlflix for example, because otherwise investors would likely not give them enough money to operate.

Then, these people started to realize this was a dangerous game to play.
With recent boycotts, like Bud Light or Planet Fitness over Tranny shit, they understand they will lose in the long run.

During the pandemic boeing fired a FUCKLOAD of people, the DEI types inside of the company used it as an opportunity to "diversify" the workforce - they didn't call these guys back after they started hiring again.
The fact it's now a bunch of jeets and fat black women is one thing, another is that there was a lot of know-how within the company that is now gone and has to be rebuilt by people much lesser than the ones that built it at the start.

A nigger DEI woman is going to lead USA.
That is the ultimate nigger golem for the Jews.
This isn't going to end well.
I am absolutely sure Biden will win and then drop a deuce or something and it will be transferred to Kamala.
Since this clownworld already has such things like Jews whose name translate to Mr. Moneybags type shit.
And 'Kamala Harris' literally translates to 'Horrible Harris' in Finnish.
So Horrible Harris being megaboss of the 'free' Jewish banker controlled world is just hits the right spot.
The Jews in USA are already banning opposition by literally declaring them as 'terrorists'
It's good trick, how budding political parties based on European Nationalism can ever rise up if they are completely destroyed by designating them terrorists barring anyone from having any dealings with them with the risk of getting your life destroyed, assets frozen and getting thrown to jail
>https://www.state.gov/terrorist-designations-of-nordic-resistance-movement-and-three-leaders/
This is the state of Jewish States of America today.
The Jews did it in Judeo-Bolshevik USSR too, started to jail political opponents.
Now they are doing it in the West too.
And no one bats an eye because all the news they get are from Jewish owned media and all the entertainment they watch are from Jewish streaming services and Jewish hollywood.
Imagine, funding Jewish Nationalism/Zionism is perfectly fine and kosher, AIPAC is all over the US government left right and center.
Funding European Nationalism however, would get you on the terrorist list and thrown to jail.
THINK ABOUT THAT
THE JEWS ARE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL

In theory, yes. All India needed to do was to make and sustain strategic long-term investment in education and infrastructure, plus healthcare and industry. Unfortunately, India is the very definition of incompetence. Indian culture is opportunistic to the point that they will gladly burn a potential long term relationship worth Billions to grab a few bucks today. This is why corruption is so endemic. Everybody skims as much as they can, leaving nothing left to get anything done.
Compare with Chinese corruption. In China, you had to pay bribes to build a bridge, or whatever, but the thing got built. Maybe not well, but at least it was something that looked OK. In India, you pay bribes to pay bribes, and the bridge never gets built. It's similar to how US stuff gets mired in ESG / DEI lawsuits to pay (((lawyers))).

> once you start getting wealthy enough niggers can't afford your neighborhood and they stay away, now it's a good neighborhood.

Low income housing programs, ghetto apartment complexes built in nice areas, negro welfare programs, high paying government and private dei jobs for unqualified browns, daily bussing of negros into nice areas, and blacks being allowed to just drive from their ghettos into nice white areas without restriction, all make it so a life without negros is near impossible, no matter how expensive the houses in your neighborhood are. The niggers always continue to spread, bringing crime and filth wherever they go. There is likely no escape unless whites are somehow given their right to freedom of association back or a very violent struggle ensues.

Many unions are actually hilariously capitalistic and structured much the same as large corporations if you really take a look at they way they function. They get tons of tax exemptions acting as non-profit organizations while bloating their national-level workforce.
There's no reason to dislike unions on principle unless you're a member of management that hates being unable to treat your workforce as slaves on a whim. If you're a social conservative, you should recognize that unions form an amazingly strong basis for a middle class workforce and increase social cohesion among membership (e. they're a good thing for promoting social homogenity, even if most of the large unions have been ideologically captured by LGBTQIA+ DEI garbage. Frankly, that garbage is a passing phase, the pendulum will swing back.

Unifor? Wouldn't surprise me if you got shafted. I'm dealing with a +2 year old grievance that the national union has told me to fuck off on because they refuse to interpret language that clearly, in plain English, supports my argument, and prefers to agree with the company's interpretation that requires multiple additions to our contract language that do not exist in the agreement in order to "work."

Did you get laid off due to lack of work or...? If so, I have to assume you work in a relatively small outfit. A single person moving back into a different position wouldn't cause a layoff in any large organization. My relatively small (~100 members) local has multiple members who've been pulled to work in the national union; if they ever came back from the national, they'd just resume work on the floor with the rest of us. As of now, they're just covered by temporary workers. If you're a temporary worker, yeah, you're fucked. Chances are that your employment contract with your employer is practically an at-will contract.

Those are pretty laughable concessions and nowhere near enough to convince anyone to do anything. At the bare minimum, you need to offer a complete ban to everything that is politically left of Trump by aggressively and lethally enforcing the Communist Control Act of 1954, the public hanging of Larry Fink for having ruined every form of entertainment forever with his DEI bullshit, the official declaration of a war against ethnic replacement and anti-white racism to rival in intensity with the war on terror, and the suppression of faggot, nigger, and women's rights.

Believing that there are 2 religions alongside each other, like proponents of ecclesia dei seem to believe is bad enough, but you seem to believe that 3 religions exist alongside each other. There is the old religion, the new religion, and a number of schismatic sects after that. Only the old religion is correct, and it's the one you don't even believe in. Your position is closer to the new religion, because you are an apostate ecumenist. Imagine accusing a real traditional catholic of nitpicking. Would you accuse of Lefebvre of nitpicking?

This is sketchy though because they thrive on having the power to investigate people's personal life and make a decision on their bondability, if they can't find anything, rather than go humm, that's interesting, they will feel threatened and subconsciously classify you as something negative because they're unable to control you via proxy. By presenting them with a wall, you remove the power from them.

They generally get suspicious as fuck if you don't have social media and will immediately start with the "What are you hiding" bullshit, because they are used to being able to exercise such high levels of control over everyone.

>Boeing's Starliner spacecraft's return from the International Space Station to Earth will be delayed until mid-next week as NASA and astronauts troubleshoot helium leaks and try to figure out why some of the thrusters failed during the latest test flight.
>At a press briefing on Tuesday, Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, said Starliner would end its first crewed mission to the ISS no earlier than next Wednesday - or about three weeks after it first launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

So you mean they can't find someone severely overqualified for the job that would work for pennies? I had a job contact me this month that called for a lead controls engineer for a night shift for a food manufacturer in the heart of Philadelphia. They wanted a bachelors/masters and 5-8 years of exp with leadership exp all for the low low price of 12.30/hr + some bennies the janitor at the same place literally makes more (18/hr) and then they wonder why they can't find or retain people.

>Nuke all recruiter and HR involvement in hiring. Make managers hire directly.
This would solve 90% of the problems in the hiring process, but they will never do it due to DEI/affirmative action

I'm not but not for these meme reasons, he's a Whig cunt every bit as bad as Lincoln. Why anyone would vote for democrats when they just promote progressive policy ad nauseam, is beyond stupid but it's equally ignorant to vote for republicans as they push to condone progressive status quo rather than end it. DEI and abortions aren't the only progressive issues that need to be rolled back, no "right-wing" politicians is advocating greater dismantling of progressive encroachment. There is no logical reason to vote democrat or republican when both protect progressive ideology one way or another.

>Demonization of hydrocarbons
>Millions of illegals to depress wages, increase crime, and replace whites
>CRT/DEI and other assorted "Cultural Marxism" to destroy our institutions (education, military, industry) from within

Ancestral European religions fastest growing religions in the West! Anonymous ID:GmPCkUYb Wed 19 Jun 2024 14:02:52 No.471621521  Replies: 2 ViewReport
With the imminent death of christjewery, Ancestral European religions are about to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

>The Army will fuck you, so you have to fuck it back a little and get what you can out of it.
Anon speaks truth. Army provides a ton of opportunities but will never tell you what they are or how to utilize them. I learned about them through other NCOs that were on their way out.

I did a contract as a medic, so civilian reciprocity wasn't good for the training and work required of a medic. Unofficially, you could find yourself doing RN stuff at E-4 pay, and calling the shots on big details like an E-9 or O-5 on your own, and the way to move up is to become a nurse or flight medic (paramedic). If you're good you'll pull way above your weight by the ton. Not worth the pay.

I went to the dark side to the Space Force, and having BAH and BAS without getting married is a big plus. I would not recommend the military to most people though. Zoomies in particular just do not like answering to any sort of authority, not to mention they're really drugged up by 18.

>You think they'd ever be willing to hand out a security clearance to people who post here, let alone have clicked here more than once in their life.
I have one. The security clearance investigation is trying to suss out if you are prone to being bribed, related to anything that would cause you to conduct corrupt behaviors, or too mentally unstable to be trusted with sensitive information.

4chan isn't even on their radar at all unless you have specific contacts the feds don't want you to know of. Even the investigation isn't perfect though. They rely heavily on social media to build a history these days, so the DEI hire that does your case file will absolutely hit a brick wall at full speed if you don't have one. The DEI hire that grilled all of my Army buddies during the investigation still got absolutely nothing out of them. However, lack of evidence does not constitute suspicious behavior. It just means there is no paper trail.

Yeah I've seen that happen. Except in my area, it's mostly Puerto Ricans and other brown mystery meat in the cities. Only a small number of Jeets live in the ghetto. They prefer the suburbs so they can live 3 generations to a single apartment and send their 7 kids to white schools.

Also Hassidic Jews bought up a lot of apartments and rent them to blacks and ricans. They are awful people. Even though we don't even have many at all in the area. But they own a lot of multi-family housing.

Your actually behind the time the United States produces more in manufacturing product then the rest of the world bar China.


We produce high quality expensive tech focused equipment thing is we use 1/100th the amount of workers as China and therefore have to create thousands of useless jobs to keep the plebs going.


I work in engineering and the machines are so efficient they have me and 4 operators running a unit that produces 10 million dollars worth of product a day.


During a turn around we have like 50 people working nonstop for 4 weeks every 4-6 months to clean and check the machines and ensure they are running optimal the rest of the time I’m just crunching data creating reports for business people to use to make slideshows that show line going up for their bosses


Besides the operators we have stone masons, welders and other lackeys running around fixing shit


Along with epa and safety faggots rolling around on a golf cart bothering everyone.


Half of employees on site are useless functionaries rubber stamping and me and the homies who run the manufacturing plant.

We’re only like 15% of the companies employees though producing 100% of the value rest of the 85% people work in offices doing bullshit living off the money we create. Like: accounting, legal, hr, mbas, project leads, DEI people, social media experts ( lol we make plastic why do we need these.) main office is a whose who of ass kissers and useless fucks.

HR is pure cancer bothering us with nonsense. Finally I told them straight up that a manufacturing plant isn’t where we can do their DEI bullshit. I’m not hiring an operator or a welder because they’re a bigger tranny because we’re welding and operating systems that can explode and kill 5000 people and cost the company millions in fines and repairs.


I said that’s what the office is for where the women and minorities can work stress free knowing if the job fucks up nothing bad will happen.

Gender studies grads were limited to Starbucks barista until all this DEI or ESG bullshit and that is where they belonged.

Education itself is a racket where universities overcharge for nonsense degrees because it's treated like a ticket to a middle class lifestyle and nothing more. If we went back to having actual academic standards there'd also be fewer blue haired psychos running HR and also fewer whores who go to college only to fuck a hundred guys a semester. It would be about actual education again but believe me, only smart people getting educated is a much bigger threat to the ruling class than unions, which invariably side with big business anyway.

Engineering only benefits you if you're white. STEM is only a meme if you're a shitskin, as they have no ability to actually problem solve or think creatively. Which is the whole point of engineering. I've been EE for a decade for a large multinational, and its so funny watching HR lose their shit because they keep throwing DEI hires at us and the only people that are able to do this job are white. I think we have one femoid and an ancient nigger in our entire department. Everyone else is white, or some weird flavor of brown about to get fired or quit after 3 months for not being able to do basic shit.

Most game design teams were much smaller back then anon. Some of the greatest games ever made were from studios that barely reached double digits in employees. You are right about the bloat though. Especially in terms of DEI and shit like Baby Inc who work as commissars for wrongthink.

Nowadays you still have the indie studios and with the tech its easier for them to put out games. The problem now is they cannot handle the larger scale games which will remain shit. You also have a number of game genres that are still dead but many of them are actively being revived by indie devs and old fans who are putting up the initial funds. Recently you even have old timer big names fleeing the larger companies and starting over to redo things from scratch. Except this time hopefully, they will remain in control.

As usual, some niggers complained that they weren’t getting their DEI cut.

It’s always niggers with respect to Mexico.

Unstable government and roving cartels (when pre 1992 we had stable cartel relations) = niggers and because of niggers cia trying to squeeze as much drug productivity out of Mexico to help pay for niggercare and how much niggers really cost America.

Soviet Union collapsed because of their insane military spending, an actual space Star Wars program (they took Reagan seriously), Afghanistan, Ukraine and Chernobyl incident (foreign interference), cia sabotage via computer chip designs, and some republics getting uppity and costing the central ie Russians and Slavs more then they were worth.

America Soviet Union is going to collapse because of niggers.

With the imminent death of christjewery, Ancestral European religions are about to become a mega trend! They have the broadest appeal:

>Economic: with the economy collapsing, a strong in-group preference is the most important thing that a tribe can have. Also, factor in DEI and other anti-White European/Aryan policies and this shows that most White Europeans/Aryans need to find a unifying (but anti-universalist/christjew) creed. For example, over 80% of jobs come from word of mouth. This is why pajeets with the worlds smallest brains and the world's lowest IQ are taking over finance and tech. So, pragmatically, a group like the Asatru Folk Assembly offers a good social network.

>Politically: jews are only 2% of the population but because they are extremely ethnocentric and politically motivated they project a considerable amount of influence in the political theater. But imagine if this was replicated by another highly ethnocentric and politically motivated religion such as the AFA?

>Appeal: Ancestral European religions have the broadest appeal. They appeal to pantheists, polytheists, and atheists. Also, a naturalistic Jungian Paganism sect would be a good way of bringing women into the fold and turning them away from Leftism (secularized christianity).

We on the cusp of something huge!

>The levels of degeneracy have likely decreased because of internet-related security, but the levels of you being exposed to it have dramatically increased because of internet-related information.
This is important, yes.
The problem is, we have a situation where many millenials have been coping rather than helping out zoomers, or even worse nuking them by fucking around with their girls a bit too much and making it public.
Not to mention all the people who have been spending money on things they can't regularly afford so that they can spread it on instagram.
It's a good thing to restore standards and encourage zoomers to work for it. But in reality the top 10-15% forgot that 85% live in the same reality as DEI hires and didn't figure out how to lead them properly.
They don't want to share the same reality, but set examples that are more about thumbing their noses rather than knowing how to encourage and get them to follow along. They don't know how to inspire zoomers.
It has its good sides, but they need to reach out to the core zoomer population a bit more and include them in the club, and tell them things like this Canuck poster said in ways younger ones understand. If they don't know how to do this, they need to figure out how. They can take lessons from how others dealt with it instead of beating themselves or zoomers over the head in an unproductive fashion.

Can any Democrat in this thread explain why it's "higher IQ" to support Democrats over Republicans? Why should I as a white man support Democrats when they work against my best interests with dei and horrible crime reform?

My understanding is they have already bungled a false flag or two. Apparently DEI even hits mossad ops.

Am accountant this is actually 100% correct and I clicked on this going let me see what they are wrong about thinking no one knew this. But it’s even worse than pictured.

>have $1m in assets
>borrow 750k with balling payment of $500k at end of 5 years
>live off $750k over 5 years, buy new assets
>govt prints more money, all assets including new ones increase in value
>end of 5 years have 1.5m assets, borrow 1.2, pay off the balloon payment of last loan, live off this loan for 5 years

Except it’s usually for multiple millions not just 1m used for example. Inflation is awesome for them, but interest rates would hurt them if they paid the same as us, which thanks to ESG and DEI the real big fish don’t have to.

That was taught by Deming. It's not something that the Japanese came up with, but they did embrace it to a far greater degree than America. Turns out, having a powerful QA/QC department makes better product than a powerful DEI/ESG department.

The reason is much simpler, is because the average american is increasingly non-white, and using DEI Jews have redelegated the positions not already staffed by Jews to their nigger golems.

USA restricted immigration to Americans, meaning Northern and Western Europeans, from 1776 to 1965.
What happened in 1965?
Well, a certain Jew by the name of Emanuel Celler, had infiltrated your government and repealed the race-based National Origins Formula, and installed the Hart-Cellert Act of 1965 in it's place which removed the race restrictions and replaced them with restrictions of migrating from Europe (global cap).
When the act was introduced, it immediately decreased the amount of people coming from Northern and Western European races and opened the floodgates for everyone else, including Jews.

>The National Origins Formula had been established in the 1920s to preserve American homogeneity by promoting immigration from Western and Northern Europe. During the 1960s, at the height of the (((civil rights movement))), this approach increasingly came under attack for being racially discriminatory.
>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 created a seven-category preference system that gives priority to [...], and refugees.
>The law abolished the National Origins Formula, which had been the basis of U.S. immigration policy since the 1920s. The act formally removed de facto discrimination against Southern and Eastern Europeans as well as Asians, in addition to other non-Western and Northern European ethnicities from the immigration policy of the United States.
>Prior to the Act, the U.S. was 85% White, with Black people (most of whom were descendants of slaves) making up 11%, while Latinos made up less than 4%.

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965

Remember to be thankful to the Jews that the country is non white.

Same thing is being perpetrated by the Jews everywhere in the West, see the webms in >>471454490

Labour chooses a white cishet man to lead their party while Conservatives choose a progressive British-Indian Success story to inspire millions around the world, through their vaunted DEI process. Labour simply talks about delivering change, Conservatives deliver it. We all know why Labour will never let women or BAME lead, it's because Corbyn is a literal nazi who wants to see Israel burn.

And golden parachutes. They will take over a productive company run it into the ground and the CEO will leave with "bonus pay". Really it's just an extortion fee for getting rid of him when the company goes through a bankruptcy and needs a new CEO to try to turn it around. Around half of them never recover from intentional mismanagement so their buddies can get rich off the stock market. Jews did this before DEI was a thing. Enron was an example of this behavior.

It's the trolley test but in effect.
These machines only work because you have to go the extra mile and check everything, stuff only professionals think of because of their years of experience. Not everything is in the manual, not everything is covered by training.
These dei hires do not go beyond what they are shown, they are baffled by autonomy, "how can you know something you have not been shown?".
It is called inspiration, the last 10% in 110% effort.
You won't find it in the training manual.

So sick and tired of anything that makes niggers / African Americans whatever look bad gets covered up.

No more. Endless stories about how they’re stealing, killing, looting, screwing up at companies, DEI hires killing people at Boeing and other companies with their nigger incompetence, nonstop stories about how many people nigger doctors nurses etc med staff kill every year due to malpractice or intentional negligence.

ANYONE WHO COVERS FOR THEM IS AN AMALEK LOVER AND THEREFORE AN ENEMY OF ISRAEL AND GOD.

Im inclined to believe its niggers from DEI hiring but than Jews are also pretty fucking evil and I hate chinks too. Ive also heard that none of it is real and its all fake news from Russia.
