I hate DEI, women, niggers and spics and jeets more than anyone. But it's not enough to explain what happened. This isn't "they were just really fucking incompetent". This is "they were incompetent to such an absurd degree that can't even be rationalized"

It would be like going to McDonald's, ordering a big Mac, going home and opening the bag to find a shoe in it. Not exactly "I said no pickles and they put pickles on it!". It's a shoe. They put a shoe in it. There would be no level of incompetence to explain it. They quite obviously intentionally put a shoe in the bag and served it to you.

Boeing is a striking confluence of everything wrong with coporations. As such, while being exemplary in many ways, it isn't a good example to hold for the competency crisis as the destruction is coming from so many angles.
Just to list a few:
>corporate buyout / sell-out of company values
>accounting-driven
>DEI (CC)
>whistleblowers dying - end game corporatism
>outsourcing jobs (CC possibly)
>advertising masquerades as safety - your pilots don't need training!
>ad hoc engineering solution - MCAS AOA sensor
>no redundancy in system design - engineering incompetence (CC)
>endless C-suite faggotry and golden parachutes
>government regulatory collusion
>not facing consequences for killing 346 - slap on wrist fines
This is coming from a casual observer angle as well. I have hardly gone out of my way to watch more than a couple of documentaries and a little bit of thinking. Many mega-corporations share similar features. Don't even have to get into /pol/ issues like the jew and such.
It might be a worthwhile thing to plot CC trendline. Where does it start, and where are we at now.
I am not sure what the earliest example would be. Fast food zoomers are one angle, they are too incompetent to even hold fast food jobs.

He was kind of making a point, though. Cops are told that the most important thing is that they get to go home safely to their families at the end of their shift. Which is a smart thing to tell your disposable heroes, morale-wise, because the younger ones used to still be brave enough to die, despite the mission statement, once their adrenaline was flowing. Post DEI, which I'd say is 80% among leadership positions, I don't know that any cop is going to do shit except MAYBE cover his buddy's ass along with his own.

He was an accelerationist. The SS & law enforcement that let it happen are accelerationists with a healthy mix of incompetent. This is the most plausible scenario. This explains Crooks's confusing political alignment. He was a 20-year old edgelord who believed "burn it all down and rebuild" and thought (correctly) that shooting Trump was the quickest way to cause a civil war.

The federal agencies involved in protecting the President are a mish-mash of incompetent DEI hires and blackpilled white guys who see their situation as hopeless. The DEI hires are too fucking retarded to protect anyone, and the blackpilled white guys aligned ideologically with the edgelord shooter. They figured, fuck it, we can't reverse the incompetence in our agencies, might as well burn it down and start over. So they did everything they possibly could to let the shooter take his shots.

You will never hear an official explanation that touches on this though. It will always be "muh slipped through the cracks" and "muh he had no online presence" and they'll paddock it.

Ineffective Coordination and Communication

The sniper teams were not communicating effectively, leading to critical blind spots. Effective communication is vital in high-stakes scenarios to ensure all potential threat vectors are covered. The lack of coordination among the sniper teams resulted in a failure to detect and respond to the shooter.

In high-profile security operations, communication protocols are established to maintain situational awareness and coordinate responses. The breakdown in communication observed in this incident suggests either a failure to adhere to these protocols or intentional interference.

Lack of Immediate Action by Cops

Cops stationed outside AGR International did nothing when the shooter pointed a gun at them. All the cop needed to do was shoot into the ground to enact protection actions, but this basic response was not taken. Similarly, cops inside the AGR International building did nothing while the shooter climbed the roof.

The inaction of the cops indicates a significant lapse in security procedures. The failure to respond to a direct threat raises questions about their training, instructions, and potential involvement in the conspiracy.

Untrained or Under-qualified Personnel

The replacement of highly trained USSS agents with less experienced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) females compromised the effectiveness of the security detail. The timing and nature of these personnel changes raise questions about their motivations. Deploying less experienced personnel at such a critical time undermined the overall security operation.

The decision to replace experienced agents with less qualified personnel suggests an intentional effort to weaken the security detail. This change in personnel likely contributed to the numerous lapses and failures observed during the event.

With the new age of tech and DEI, a combination of scrutiny and incompetence has given us all a window to observe how evil our government and its owners truly are. This is probably why DEI seems to be shrinking away in corporate sphears, along with the "in your face" part of the woke agenda being dumped. They will ditch DEI and woke faggotry in time I'm sure, and go back to the old way of doing things. In my opinion it was likely all an expirament. They probably expected women and niggers to be competant enough to keep society in the dark like they did with the egregious Kennedy assassinations and 9/11. The people at the top will still be evil, but competant evil. Their merit and allegiance to retarded demons gods like Moloch and Baphomet will determine their place in government. The Devil we did know was atleast stupid and easy to trigger. These new ruthless assholes will be silent but deadly all of the way. Enjoy Richard Levine while you can guys. Clowns like him will be replaced with no nonsense Satanic traitors.

This is some of the starkest evidence we've ever had regarding the potential danger of DEI/affirmative action. We got to see the female agents on the ground look like inept idiots and nearly get him killed, and we get to see the female director look like a smug inept idiot and, perhaps most importantly, take no accountability for something she is directly accountable for. If she were Trump's director of SS she would have been fired on Sunday. Were she a man with any dignity or sense of accountability she would have resigned on Monday. Instead, she's a smug, retarded woman that doesn't belong there and she's going to continue smugly insisting she had nothing to do with direct organizational and operational breakdown.

If you take the name of any institution that is failing, like the Secret Service or the Pennsylvania State Police or even Boeing, and then type in DEI after it and search.
This is why we are falling apart.
Take every theory, every single data we DON'T know about the assassination attempt out of the equation and input what everyone DOES know. that DEI just about got a former President and the Nominee of his party killed.
And innocent bystanders were killed and injured.
this all lay squarely at teh feet of a defeated ideology.

I'm sorry but I find this to be a straight up slave mentality. How do people even think like this? If I'm off doing my own thing somewhere, no I'm not representing my company. That's absurd. I get that mentally ill people on twitter are like this but if you meet some asshole at the bar, do you immediately think about whatever company he works for? As for "promote speech they might not want to", that is also ridiculous. Any company of a sufficient size is going to have people with conflicting opinions. So should any person in the company with a slightly different opinion always keep their mouth shut because it might be different than what the company officially supports? Even on their private time? I mean this is the current reality of many employed conservatives right now. Most of them probably disagree with their company's DEI programs. It seems like you're totally fine with continuing to oppress. And just one more thing. Whatever I say on my time is MY opinion. It is not the company's opinion. They are not promoting anything just because one guy who happens to work for them says something.

That is precisely what this is. If a qualified individual was running the SS, no would be having this conversation. A big part of diversity is having options, and it looks like this time the option they went with for SS supervisor was a bad one. It doesn't have to be anyone's fault, but Kimberly Cheatle will only further hurt her goals of increasing diversity in government organizations by refusing to step down. It sends a message to the American people the DEI is not in their best interest and our creditors cannot have allow a sentiment like that to persist.

I give you DEI.
If you take everything that you DON'T know out of the equation, the main reason this happened was incompetence due to DEI.

And therein lies the problem with your argument because what you are proposing doesn't mean shit unless it is actually passed as law.

And why the fuck should companies be obligated to hire some retard who runs their mouth and gives the company a bad reputation? You have every right to work somewhere else and you have no obligation to say yes to your employment contract so why don't you just work at a company that doesn't care instead?

>b-but anon there isn't one that will hire me.

Sucks to be you. Make a company then. Why should the success of other hard working people and their enterprises be dragged down by your notoriety? Get off your ass and make a company with your own rules if you don't like it, work hard and compete the capitalist way or shut your bitch ass up and stop trying to force companies to keep you on regardless of how much you drag their reputation through the mud and impact their revenue as a result.

DEI has already removed most straight white males from any position of influence within these companies and whites are a tiny percentage of new hires.
The program has achieved it's goals, browns can be relied upon to exclude whites, and it's now raising more alarm bells than it's worth.
Microsoft specifically are looking for an edge over their competition with generative AI and DEI-fags are a disproportionate drag on those programs

I did read it. That is how the jew dialectic functions though. Get a few globohomo institutions and organizations to back off of the DEI shit in a superficial way. At the same time, the get conservative Republican Party a White man might otherwise have thought is on his side somewhat dive head first into DEI.
The White man who is against the DEI stuff is then left feeling like he has no political home, no political voice, and must accept the new normal.
Then the Globohomo institutions and organizations resume their extreme DEI measures, pushing the issue further along.

None of these things means the sign was or is wrong. We’ve seen all of this before.

Speaking as someone who has liberal views but hates wokeness, it's because for decades, there's been media and propaganda that paints hetero cisgender white men as the source of evil. YASS QUEEN and all that other jazz is what's being peddled.

Coupled with this browbeating, women get more favorable advantages. Look at the workplace. A lying bitch can make up shit about a dude or say "he makes her uncomfortable" while she sits in a cushy office job and does jackshit. Or get into good universities to check off DEI boxes.

I haven't been on the dating market since 2017. I was too busy working, saving, and finishing my masters after undergrad. Then corona lockdown really dampened social contact. But even as a kid growing up in the late 00's and throughout the 2010's, you realize what a shitshow the world has become.

Microsoft just fired its DEI team in trend that has been going on in the corporate world over the last year. The corporations, the deep state, the banks and kikes are what truly matters, everyone else eventually either promotes the same stuff or gets ignored or destroyed. Tenacious D just apologised for their awful remarks about Trump. Woke leftists will be ignored or even cancelled.

Ineffective Coordination and Communication

The sniper teams were not communicating effectively, leading to critical blind spots. Effective communication is vital in high-stakes scenarios to ensure all potential threat vectors are covered. The lack of coordination among the sniper teams resulted in a failure to detect and respond to the shooter.
In high-profile security operations, communication protocols are established to maintain situational awareness and coordinate responses. The breakdown in communication observed in this incident suggests either a failure to adhere to these protocols or intentional interference.

Lack of Immediate Action by Cops

Cops stationed outside AGR International did nothing when the shooter pointed a gun at them. All the cop needed to do was shoot into the ground to enact protection actions, but this basic response was not taken. Similarly, cops inside the AGR International building did nothing while the shooter climbed the roof.

The inaction of the cops indicates a significant lapse in security procedures. The failure to respond to a direct threat raises questions about their training, instructions, and potential involvement in the conspiracy.

Untrained or Underqualified Personnel

The replacement of highly trained USSS agents with less experienced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) females compromised the effectiveness of the security detail. The timing and nature of these personnel changes raise questions about their motivations. Deploying less experienced personnel at such a critical time undermined the overall security operation.

The decision to replace experienced agents with less qualified personnel suggests an intentional effort to weaken the security detail. This change in personnel likely contributed to the numerous lapses and failures observed during the event.

MAGA is the most truly liberal movement Anonymous ID:/vK/65ws Wed 17 Jul 2024 06:35:41 No.474553218  Replies: 7 ViewReport
The MAGA coalition includes whites, hispanics, blacks, asians, kikes, catholics, hindus, atheists, straights, gays, trannies, etc. It's truly diverse and truly inclusive, accepting everyone from all backgrounds as long as they adhere to a few American cultural aspects such as belief in the Constitution and being patriotic. A black lesbian porn star with tattoos and a nose ring can be a MAGA supporter just as much as some blue collar white guy from Kansas. MAGA also truly believes in meritocracy, unlike the left. Really, MAGA is what liberalism would be like if DEI and woke didn't infiltrate and subvert almost every American institution. MAGA is a return to 90s style liberalism. Anyone of any background can be an American as long as they wave an American flag and shout "MAGA!"

You can support Trump as much as you want, and desu 90s liberalism is much better than what we've been living through the last decade, but don't be delusional and think that Trump is going to create a based tradcath society, or usher forward an ethnonationalist nietzschean ubermensch movement.

White American men are generally cucks and simp to their wives once they get married. It doesn't matter who they are; even chad can turn into a cuck once they get married, some even trooned out due to his pozzed wife. Pretty much many White husbands are controlled by their wives like a puppet
And politicians are no exception, in fact it is even worse: Every single White American politicians that racemix, have weakness of subtle allegiance with their non-white wives because they fear of getting divorced. Their shitskin wives whisper on their ears for women's whimsical wishes.

What Fatgass did was the latter. What the pro Palestinian protesters at Harvard were doing was the former. Which is why the fraud DEI hire was hilariously right in her statements and understanding of the law when she was under the gun for not shutting the protests down.

See, I’d consider this doomerfaggot meme to be well poisoning.
Again, DEI isn’t going away, it’s just being rebranded.
The RNC went full DEI on opening night and even if all illegals are deported they just want to flood the country “legally” with poojeets.
Some leftards getting cancelled doesn’t make groceries or housing more affordable.

I think trumps too much of a bitch to cut himself as demons do not like pain.
Most likely a blood capsule or packet as he is trained an actor and wrestling performer.
The whole thing was a poorly executeded, with trump telling his DEI SS to "hold on" for his photo op, as if SS would ever do that incase theres a second shooter.

The biggest problem isn't the fact that there wasn't local le or usss on the roof; it's the fact that at the mere hint of a suspicious person didn't immediately prompt a command from usss to fastwalk trump off the stage and into the truck to await an all clear. No, instead, they all dicked around over the radio while barney fife checked the guy out, fell off the ladder and allowed the kid to sight trump back in and fire which resulted in the countersnipers taking him out. During ALL that time, not ONE fucking person thought to maybe stop the speech out of precaution.
THAT'S the problem.

There are a few differences. Not many of importance. You're not changing the banking cartel.
But the democrats do use executive order to push DEI and anti-meritocracy through all institutions and the public sector. Trump specifically does not do this. Merit among your society is a hugely important concept and this is the last traces slipping out. As is being oil independent and having low gas prices is genuinely better for your economy and citizens.

These are modest things, but it's the difference in how quickly you want the nation to implode.

You guys have no idea how fucking worse things are going to get
This shit starts way back, around 2010 or earlier
Before then, big tech was a haven for white nerds. If you wanted to do awesome shit with the best gear available and surrounded by smart people, it was the place to go.
Awesome shit was made. Gmaps was literal magic at the time. Some things that were thought as technically impossible became reality in years.
Then suits moved in. The smart ones understood what was going to happen immediately. A good portion just left with the coffers and started their own startup - only to be bought back again (the big "acquihire" wave of the mid 2010). Most retired after that.
Smart whites started doing shit like working at google for 3-4 years, living in a van outside in the parking lot, and saving literal millions in order to retire right after that. I personally know one that did, he's now chilling in costa rica, never to work again.
This was all before the DEI holocaust. That started around 2016. By that time, everyone was already bleeding talent profusely with no end in sight.
DEI was the death sentence for everything even remotely related to R&D at those companies. They now barely manage to keep the things that were made by white engineers decades ago. AWS, google cloud, azure are all kept running by a handful of white engineers in their 50s. They cover those guys in gold so they don't leave (I know none personally but I heard stories of comps of over 10$Mil a year).
But at some point they will. There is no replacement, and there's no way to train replacements as all talent is long gone. Most core tech at those companies is treated as magic black boxes, nobody dares to touch it.

Boomers are characteristically big talking, abject cowards. This guy called the old man's bluff. Even though he failed in his mission, Trump will now have to fear assassination everywhere he goes... and as a result he has lost the will to keep his promises (though doubtful he ever had it to begin with).
Trump has now folded with his calls for "unity" (which is really just the DEI agenda). Boomers will vote for him because they simply want their own branded version of DEI.
He will win, but it will be a Pyrrhic victory.

Fucking LOL. The cabal just got exposed with their failed plot to bump off DJT, the bungling was so obvious that even normies are starting to NOOOOOOOOTICE and switch sides, they put DEI hires in charge of a demonic black op and WOW!! what do you know, they fuck it up, what a surprise!

So guaranteed, in the last 48 hours there was a SUPER SECRET meeting on some SUPER SEKRIT slack channel or whatever the fuck, and this is what they came up with? This tired, lame ass shit? "HEY LOOK, it was IRAN that tried to assassinate the president! Time for another war to protect Israel, now sign up goyim! Don't ask awkward questions! Nothing to see here!"

I really think they're losing it. They're desperate and trying to improvise and they know they're losing. Keep up the pressure anons. And whatever you do don't fall for any of their retarded "SHOOTER WAS A REPUBLICAN" or "IRAN DID IT" bullshit.

No thought ever went into DEI other than "white people must be replaced"
Think about it. Who are you going to have a better work relationship with, the darkie with zero experience who was hired because of his skin, or the darkie who was hired entirely based on his extensive experience in the field?

Yes you'll be getting a LOT fewer if it only hire based on talent and skill, but at least you get actual workers that can exist in teams without being concrete collars on their white colleagues trying to stay afloat.

Nothing builts racism and resentment more than seeing people being given positions they could never have gotten otherwise if not for quotas. If all you have to offer a company and potential coworkers is your black hide or a Mexican surname, you should KYS.

Exactly. Its just too many things. They refused him extra security. They diverted his regular team to Jill Biden. People saw him and told cops but no one cared. For 27 minutes. A cop confronted him, knowing he was armed and let the suspect draw on him first, then left the roof without radioing anybody before or after. And also there were no SS units on the roof in the first place because the roof was tilted... oops that sounded dumb no its because it was too hot up there, like oh em geez you guise.

Do I have to spell it out for you Agent Retard? There is reports of a second shooter, the story of "oh gee willy that goober cop just stood down when a gun was pointed at him". Cops/SS inside the building don't even bother to investigate the roof, the most obvious fucking thing. Even DEI retard women have to take basic courses to become Secret Service and learn the basics of scouting things out. So why did Blackrock sell that building right before the assassination glownigger agent? Why did Trumps media get shorted when everything showed him rising in the polls steadily post debate? Why did he get shorted 8 million dollars right before this happened? Why did Blackrock Pull that video? Why did they happen to own that Building in the first place? Lets talk about AGR. Whats the history with them? You know what shithead? Keep at your little game, eventually this is all going to come out. More people are going to ask questions and yes glownigger heads are going to roll and it's going to be you clowns involved in this charade. I remember posts JUST like yours in September 2017.

People say I'm a shill but this really does look like lone wolf + DEI security. It seems improbable, but all the other explanations seem impossible or make no sense.

The idea that it's a false flag makes no sense. That either means they aimed for his ear (ridiculous) or used fake blood (ridiculous). Plus if they wanted him reelected they just have to let the election play out. He will win a legit election or they could just steal it for him. Why would they need to go through this ridiculous charade?

So what else could it be? If the intel agencies wanted him dead he would be dead. Zionists don't want him dead - they have been signaling that they are going to reinstall him, especially since the debate.... so did the anti-zionist jews do it? How could they fuck up that bad? If they wanted him dead, he'd be dead.

It seems like it was a lone wolf and the kid was probably shitting his pants and jerked the trigger. Or had a bad zero on the rifle. Or both. The diversity service failed to properly coordinate with the local cops. They are stupid and lazy. Also in the aftermath all kinds of information was immediately getting out. It wasn't a well oiled intelligence operation. If the was a planned patsy they would have had a narrative about his motivation ready immediately. I haven't heard anything about his motivation. The glowies seem as confused as we are.

With Trump’s recent assassination attempt, the seeming synchronization of many of his former enemies in the media and politics coming to his side, the increasing denunciation of DEI, the supposed Iranian follow up assassination attempt on Trump, the doubling down of RNC and MAGA to worshipping Israel — all seems incredibly stage managed.

I think what we’re seeing is a deep state dialectic reaction forming under Trump which Biden was the set up for now that his political capital has expired, and this is the reaction and the reaction is going to be essentially a typical American political deep state “rebranding” aka meet the new boss same as the old boss.

Expect a likely detachment from Ukraine with Trump as the U.S. declares victory and then memory holes the entire debacle (just like with Covid), expect no accountability, and then expect a New CrisisTM that will flood the MSM and NPC brains. Expect war in the ME involving the U.S. and increased belligerence towards China. The neocon empire at all costs. I think if you’re optimistic, you’re a fool.

>The best possible path Europe can take
Why can't Europe follow China? China is an ethnostate where 93% of the population is Han Chinese, with essentially zero Jews, zero blacks, and zero Indians (including Roma gypsies). The minorities follow Chinese social and cultural norms. China is Socialist, so they provide for their people, 90% own their homes. The absence of violent and parasite races means they can have efficient public transportation, public healthcare, and unattended honor system shops. Being a single party meritocratic dictatorship, they don't have parasites buying control. Basically no degeneracy, or DEI nonsense.

The last time Europe had anything like this was during the late 1930s and early1940s. Think about it.

Did “they” legitimately mean to take Trump out and failed? Anonymous ID:kMzzG390 Tue 16 Jul 2024 19:53:06 No.474506273  Replies: 87 ViewReport
Quoted By: >>474507153
There are too many oddities with the inaction taken by the SS and police for this to have been an actual lone wolf scenario. IMO, two scenarios are most probable. Either they staged EVERYTHING and had some method for faking the blood while still using real bullets for the crowd; or it was a legitimate assassination attempt by the deep state that failed.

The fact that this basically guaranteed Trumps re-election while making Biden look even weaker leads me to think it was all staged. But if their goal was to cause a civil war blowing Trump’s brains out on live tv would have been a damn good way to kick that off.

Do the Illuminati types ever play games based purely on chance? You know, like hire a DEI sniper with a 70% chance of hitting the mark; if you survive, one timeline occurs, if you don’t then a more negative timeline follows?

It could be “fake” in the sense that the shooter was told to hit various points but not hit Trump himself. However this of course means they faked the blood and I’m not sure exactly how they would have done it. That post about him having something in his hand is inaccurate. If you go back he has his palms facing the camera a few seconds before the first shot.

A possibility I do think is likely is that this was a legitimate deep state assassination attempt that failed. There’s an Illuminati card with “our shooters can take you out” with a face similar to Trumps. It’s very possible they wanted a headshot broadcast on live tv to start an American civil war and their DEI sniper fucked it up.

Retard, it was the Jews. They're scared shitless of Trump getting elected again so they planned this faggy DEI bullshit at the RNC to steal votes away from him.

They also paid for Trump to pick that faggot coal burner Vance as his VP so they can replace him with a good goy white replacement enabler when the next assassination attempt succeeds.

This is quite possibly the most obvious Jewish ploy of all time. You'd have to be retarded not to see it.

DEI is something that sounds good on paper, but in reality it means hiring total mooks who can't do their job and are focused entirely on extracting company resources while doing no work and moaning about racism constantly, lowering company morale for the actually productive employees.

At some point, someone has to do some actual, real work. It won't be DEI hires. Ergo, they are all negatives, no positives, and were inevitably going to be axed.

Yes, I too despise the cargo-cult treatment that has been applied to notions of "tolerance"
But you're reducing the issue here
Yes, many of the sub-prime loans were given to black
Yes, there was some "muh tolerance" window dressing
But even if those were primarily loans for "tyrones sneakers and laguishas weave"
(which they were not and many irrepsonsible loans were given to people from all walks of life that couldn't pay upfront for whatever it is they were financing - usually single family homes by volume)
the degree of society-wide catastrophy was only and exclusively reached by the systematic prioritization of specualtive greed over financial regulation
The rating agencies were greedy
Lawmakers repealed laws - the same regulatory laws that were passed as a result of the great depression
The banks were greedy
The people just followed along
And since regulatory laws were demolished in the name of liberal economic policy the train was set in motion for its timely wreckage
You just cannot balme this on "niggers pining for and being given loans for frivololous things due to DEI ideology"
It's 99% orthagonal to the actual dynamics that shaped this America (and then world) - wide economic catastrophy we are still suffering from today

Trump is 1000% shabbos. After failing to deliver on jeffery epstein locking up the clintons and injecting everyone with jew juice they have to restore the public perception that hes an outsider fighting the establishment. Hence the court cases and this latest photo gay-op. Also serves the narrative that ss is incompetent due to dei hiring. Hes going to do away with this dei tranny nonsense hes our guy. Just in time for war with iran, palantir and the ascention of the ai surveillance state.

Anyone who pushed the anti-white DEI needs to be removed from the boards and fired. Any white people fired in the past 4 years need to be rehired otherwise nothing has actually changed.

Last week or so I logged in at work to find every single desktop icon had a dot a little to its left. I think it's supposed to tell me that whatever the icon represents (invariably a shortcut or a document I intend to delete) is recognized by One Drive or something. Every Windows version has a different tray icon indicating usb device use.

That's what those DEI hires do. They're given like four years and 30 people to re-design an fucking icon. It's basically a jobs program for the retarded. They get taken through all the motions of product development, but they develop a fucking toy that a small team of skilled developers could kick out in a month or less. It's kind of like Junior Achievement for those who remember that.

Microsoft doesn't need that shit anymore. The optics don't help them, so why waste money on it. They're all in on AI and are not going to blow their first chance in like 40 years to not be the embarrassing latecomer to a such a lucrative nascent technology.

I hate to break it to them, but DEI at its peak was barely business-tolerable, never necessary and sure as hell never critical.

The water tower was mentioned in literally every thread, actually.
Claims that there was a 2nd shooter there seem baseless, since all the confirmed shots line up with the position where the dead shooter / patsy was found and do not line up with the water tower at all.
Also, the shooter would have been easily visible getting up there by the people on the parking lot, yet nobody reported it.
The SS countersnipers would have easily had a shot.
Now, the question as to why there was no overwatch on the water tower is an entirely different one.
You need to ask DEI Kimberly Cheatle about that, though, I assume she will tell you that a sniper up there would have been at high risk of getting vertigo.

Why do you call bannon little dugin?
Is it due to his shizo way of mythologizing trump and the insinuations before the coup/overturn election attempt?
I hope the next 4 years aren't too disasterous under trump and that term limits are respected.
Though even with trump gone the political shizophrenia will continue and it's just up to the next grifter to latch onto that.
Fuck man, how do we solve this shit?
I mean, take that dude that got shot at the trump rally for example.
It's so insane, it's like they live in a completely different reality and any attempt to try to talk to such people is like trying to guide a hoop along a hot wire.
A single mistake and the entire journey will have been for naught and they retreat back to their internal image of the world they created/assimilated.
Same with many of the more rabit lefties, especially around the mostly asinine and irrelevant-to-the-biggest-life-problems-for-the-population topics beside all that symbolic wokeist crap.
And of course DEI "progression" and the explicit way it's tearing societal contracts and notions of actual equality apart.
How the fuck do we move forward with everyone so paranoid and reclusive about what they actually believe?
Because you won't be seeing this shit irl, there people will mostly stick to milquetoast slogans

American business make huge amounts of money from the government but have to kiss the government's ass to get it. When Biden was in power, DEI was a way of currying favor in order to get money from the government. Right now, Trump is strongly favored to win so corporations are switching to kissing his ass so that they can continue to get government money.

I think it's just that the corpos realize that 95% of their employees and customers fucking hate it and only the most bootlicking sycophantic conformists happily go along with it. My work would repeatedly try to cajole people into putting their pronouns in their email signatures and their name tags on Zoom. Like maybe 10% actually did it. Eventually the cajoling stopped. They were starting to ramp up Antiracism training and were all gun ho about it and then eventually the emails about it slowed and then stopped. Because they installed a whole DEI apparatus/office we still have to do this training once a year, but the second year was just going through the motions. You can tell that even the DEI people doing the training didn't have their heart in it anymore. DEI is over. They pushed it for years and it's a big flop. Everyone fucking hates it even though they were too chickenshit to say so.

one of the reasons it started annoying people is because some work used in day to day work (such as 'master' and 'slave') and other such 'problematic terms' were all changed by these DEI execs in bigcorp.

Problem is nobody collectively agreed in many cases what to change them to. so each big company had different newspeak terms. changing the back-end of all this cost a fucking fortune as well. and for what?

Just read a post by a former Navy SEAL who worked with the SS on some jobs. He said they were incredibly incompetent even by police standards. He also said he was told they were never good to begin with, but went full useless after they were put under DHS and complete government initiative rot set in (I assume stuff like DEI). He said their entire capability now is as a visual/psychological deterent. Which I guess they fucked up now. He also said he believes the outcome of this will just be department heads asking for bigger budgets and then soending it on new offices and commercials.

The truth that no one will ever admit to is that DEI was an intentional effort to create hostile work cultures and work environments so that workers would not unionize, discuss wages, or labor conditions (like working 100 hours a week) and instead get distracted by infighting over race and gender and identity politics. However, the global elite fail to consider that this would ultimately result in antisemitism so they rapidly turned against DEI. I do not believe that the global elite are Jews although I'm sure there are a few ethnic in-name only Jews part of the global elite, but really, the global elite are satanic devil worshipers.

It's not even Trump or Biden, it's a matter of time. Remember that in 2016, trans barely just started, and gay marriage was only just made legal. Early Obama years it was still too niche to even talk about.

It was CURRENT YEAR (aka 2015) when the gays started to become their own bonerfied(pun) group. Nobody really cared before, and then they got greedy and wanted more and more. That's when people started to get pissed off, but it took time. For a couple years from 2015-17 or so, people didn't know what to make of all the gay shit yet.

Republican acceptance of gay shit peaked a few years ago when they still wanted to pretend, and thought they could pull in more votes. But I think it has already started to rebound for some time now, especially with DEI and trans kids shit happening.

Conservatives hate DEI because it selects for people based on their race and sex, they don’t hate it because it leads to less whites in the workplace. That’s why Indians and Jews are high in positions on the right, because through a purely meritocratic system they can thrive despite also having their own ethnic narcissism, this cannot be bestowed upon white conservatives. White conservatives must be raceblind meritocrats for this logic to hold, while their ethnic friends get to be race supremacists. MAGA will create woke meritocracy in the void of DEI

"Affirmative Action" was originally started as a temporary remedy to address past discrimination against Black people.
Then, predictably, like all government handout programs, it became permanent and everyone wanted a spot at the trough.
But no amount of discrimination could erase the massive ability gap between Whites and POX, men and womyn.
So now we have this ESG/DEI hate whitey official attitude and a growing competency crisis.
So, no, not exactly a humiliation ritual, just the intersection of government grifing and cultural marxism.

Because conservatives have been put on the back foot for the past 100 years. Even the last 20 years:

>gay marriage
>trannies
>endless infringements on 2A
>endless riots when a POC gets shot (often justifiably) in the streets
>DEI
>Endless border crisis
>Gibs bankrupting the country
>Cancel culture

Not to mention some things that affect all Americans, not just conservatives:

>NAFTA
>Outsourcing of manufacturing (fuck you middle America)
>Green Energy to the detriment of fossil fuels (fuck you middle America)
>Weapons of Mass Destruction
>2008 bank bailout
>Corruption in the government (it's not bribes, it's lobbying / insider trading is legal)
>Inflation
>Covid mandates

The only (and I mean the *only*) backstep has probably been Roe v. Wade, which wasn't a ban, but a return to state's rights. All of these things are completely off limits to discuss, conservatives shut down, called fascist, possibly canceled if you speak up. When you abandon half the electorate and give them no recourse to petition for changes, what else can you expect from them other than tossing a proverbial pipe bomb into the discourse?

Blackrock owns a majority of large companies, who own many more, that effect your daily life and have enough sway on the market to employment DEI though ESG scores. You then have the issue of these same people owning our government. We do not live in a democracy or capitalist system. We live in a Jewish oligarchy fueled by money. We effectively live in world owned by da single corporation, acting in the “interests of the public.” I’m not a fan of Marx nor do I believe in the concept of “late stage capitalism” because it has appeared thought history but what we have running the world today is unsustainable. Capitalism has failed and we arguably haven’t had it in this country since the 1930s.

That roof isn't even sloped. I did roofing for awhile like half a decade ago, and I had to go on much steeper angles than that at a much greater height. It should've been absolutely trivial for them to be up there and the excuse is a joke. If I had fallen roofing I would've broken several bones. If anyone fell from that roof they would've sprained an ankle and gotten the wind knocked out of them at most. They're secret service and should be in danger. Its their job to confront the danger and remove it from their principles surroundings. Instead what we got was female DEI hires hiding behind their principle when gunfire broke out, failing to cover their body with their own because they're a small female, and a supposed inability to holster their firearm due to lack of training.

Obviously any bodyguards should at least be as tall as the person they are protecting. Look at the heads of the male guards. They will take the bullet before it reaches Trump. Look at the woman, she is too short and everyone can see Trump's face and head, which means a bullet could too.

Having a height minimum would be height-ist. They are putting DEI bullshit ahead of practicality.

Very possible. Considering Blackrock and how it's hand are in everything due to funding, it's pretty much the 4th arm of government with 0 oversight. I'd be willing to be CIA and Blackrock are arm in arm. Another shooter is very possible, although I am unsure where he would've been stationed. Considering the delay and lack of urgency and the DEI hires in SS, DNC&Biden are setting trump up for death using plausible deniability while CIA and BR are going for the kill. I think JD Vance was a very good choice for VP in terms of tactical decisions: he isn't against Israel (so no mossad interfere(hopefully)) but is a cynical millennial and is against Ukraine funding. Taking out Trump now is a highly risky game because Vance isn't that different from trump politically and if both are killed there is a very real chance of revolt.

We know for a fact a lot of hands are in the Ukraine cookie jar. (((They))) are between a rock and a hard place. Rock: trump/ Vance removes funding and exposes the corruption, destroying both RNC, DNC, and potentially breaking Blackrock. Alternatively, Russia is still there too, and I'm willing to bet Putin isn't having this shit either. Nationalist or not, he is ex-KGB and definitely has the intel on this shit. He isn't stupid. With trump supporting Israel and Biden being obviously corruption with Ukraine, there's little mossad can/will want to do, which helps in regards to active players on the board.

I'd be willing to bet both the SS (mostly the DHS) and the Butler PA police force are compromised (pa is hugely corrupt. I have my own theories why) and evidence shows that it's reasonable to assume this isn't purely "incompetence", it's active maliciousness masquerading as plausible deniability.

>Donald Trump, the GOP’s presidential nominee, who is expected to take the stage on Thursday evening.
>JD Vance, the newly announced vice-presidential candidate, who arrived at Fiserv Forum earlier in the day.
>Theme: Tuesday’s theme is “Make America Safe Once Again,” focusing on law enforcement, crime, and border security.

>Livestream: The RNC will livestream proceedings across multiple online platforms, including YouTube and X.

>TV Coverage: ABC News will have live coverage each night from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. CT on WISN 12, with extended coverage on WISN 12 News at 10:00 p.m. CT.

With the calamity of late, the pooprayer with a weird stare on her face, some other dei-ness scheduled yesterday and the oddball behavior of leftoids and their media slave-drivers now, I'm leaning towards maybe they DID expect Trump to die and have had to scrap their menu.

At the end of the day even with all your "intelligent" analyzing of power in smarty pants cope, Trump still did fucking nothing.
Anything he did was overturned within probably a hundred days of Biden's Administration.
He's a Zionist stooge, who surrounded himself with even bigger Zionist Stooges who took every opportunity to stab him in the back.
He went ahead and coddled the balls of blacks and jews and did nothing with that "goodwill".
It's the same thing you do on a Friday night and has the same political significance.
You are a midwit, you can scrape together to understand that conservatives love losing if it gives them the moral high ground.
Yet you don't see it's the same type of moral self-flagellation to bow down at the knees of niggers and kikes and then do absolutely nothing for America and Americans just like Trump did.
We are just at the start of the competency crisis, intelligently now is the time to strike back as hard as he can at diversity hires and DEI.

This is anecdotal, but from my experiencing working in data for the past few years, when indians get into leadership positions they tend to try and hire only other indians. Which is why when you look at certain companies, a majority of certain IT divisions will almost entirely be taken up by indian people. This has been documented as well (economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/us-techie-sues-tcs-for-discrimination-against-americans-and-favouring-indians-on-h-1b-visas/articleshow/109237855.cms?from=mdr).
Its really almost a matter of perfect timing. As more indians began to come to 1st world countries for work, they get more opportunities by default because of DEI. Then as they get into these positions, they ignore the purpose of DEI and only hire their own kind.

Meanwhile the USA SS was so incompetent and filled with DEI that Trump almost got killed.

the "attempt" was fake and gay, get over it. The other possibilities (legit attempt by a lone wolf, and inside job) are nonsensical. You'd have to believe in absurd levels of incompetence for that rooftop to not be secured, not even DEI can't explain that level of incompetence.

And then there's inside job angle except anyone paying attention would know Trump is the Zionist favorite this year. Trump can deliver more to the zionists than Biden can because Biden (who is also a jewish puppet) has his hands tied more by leftist base, plus whites are too demoralized to fight for ZOG and Trump helps reinvigorate them a bit. There's also the more simple argument, if Le Deep State (jews and masons) wanted trump dead he would be dead. they could just heart attack gun him in his sleep or use some robotic mosquito to inject him with a deadly drug or some other secret tech they have.

I didn't consider it a bad thing? You can acknowledge that both Secret Service and the would be assassin were DEI hires, laugh about how stupid of a (inside) job they did, and then go back to trying to make sure everyone knows that the government tried to JFK him but failed spectacularly.
If your family or friends can't take the joke, they either won't say that wanted Trump dead, or still have this old world mentality that being in the center is more important than picking sides despite the fact that centrists are no longer in the center because of the left pushing centrists into the right and are in denial for social reasons.

No. He won by using the populist movement Steve Bannon organized into a political base and gave people who were absolutely sick of the political establishment an outsider to vote for. Chuds bandwagoned.
>in fact appealing to whites and white racial interests would easily net trump a victory, because whites are more than 75% of the voters.
No, it wouldn't. He already runs the table on white working class voters while growing in power in other disaffected groups. Taking away black votes from the Democrats would be fucking huge and it looks like that's whats happening this time.
>you aren't even supposed to pretend that white people have interests
Trump does those. White interests are a strong economy with stable reasonably high income jobs, not having DEI shit spread any further and seek to eliminate it, and to deport illegals while limiting immigration to a reasonable level. There's also an interest in creating social incentives to make home ownership affordable and make it easier to have kids at a young age (economically most people aren't ready until their 30s which is fucked /) .

RFK was viewed by the media like Trump was viewed in 2015. They thought he was a joke or a spoiler. Then when he started resonating people by speaking over the target (aside from his love of israel and niggers and DEI/affirmative action), they blackballed him just like what the left did to Bernie once independents and even republicans started agreeing with him (Bernie wanted to break up big pharma, wanted to stop corporate loopholes and corporate inversions and offshoring, wanted to break up conglomerates).

RFK is for a lot of things I don't like, but so is Trump. And Trump is now blatantly compromised by the CIA and Mossad, on top of all that.

fuck it, at least RFK cares about the health of people and has spoken out against the horrors of the pharmaceutical industry, the environment, how pollution is harmful to human health, etc. RFK actually gives a fuck about things that directly affect our lives.

Meanwhile under Trump, environmental regulations and FDA regulations were scrapped, so our environment got shittier and our food quality went down. That affects us all, directly, on the short term. Fuck that.

It's that the sterile dei corporate environment of public speed running brings these people into the spotlight for good boy points. Remember that trannies are also huge attention seekers and you will begin to see the picture. Couple that with the fact that speed running is very close to if not a mental illness and the fact that the normies who do it tend to understand this and are somewhat ashamed of it. So is it really a surprise that the mentally ill tranny that celebrates their mental illness also celebrates their other mental illnesses while the normie mentally ill tend to fly under the radar?

The economy is a multifaceted topic. There are positives Biden will speak about, the ground work for much was set by Trump. For example some manufacturing came back due to threatening Mexico and China with Tariffs and tax breaks that that caused large companies that had gotten into the habit of storing money offshore to be able to bring it back(Over a trillion from Apple alone) the benefits from that shit would obviously happen over time.

The whole printing 5 trillion dollars to grant democrats every dream project they had at the time under the guise of fighting an already defeated COVID, DEI incentives at every level and going back to China with a pre-lubed asshole thing Biden did, that has had consequences.

You're talking about either the first or second largest economy in the world, its a bit more complicated than "good" or "bad" at any given moment.

Also they are free to say nigger anytime they want, but white men can't, which is again anti-white an intended to show that white men are second class citizens in the country they built.

The government wasted nearly half a billion dollarydoos trying to convince people to alter the constitution to create an advisory body to parliament that would advise on legislation that would affect aboriginal people. Either it would have no power to force the government to follow its advice, in which case it'd be a waste of money designed to funnel money to aboriginal activists, or it would have the power to force the government to heed its advice, in which case we now have an unelected group controlling what Parliament can do.

In order to change the Aussie constitution, there needs to be a referendum that is approved by the majority of votes nationally, as well as a majority of votes in a majority of states.

It was voted against by the populace of literally every states; the only place that voted "Yes" was the ACT, which is the Aussie equivalent of Washington DC.

their wi-fi was slow

the shooter according to news got 8 shots off before he was taken out, one actually hit trump's ear

I had my entire destiny as a man ripped away from me, my bloodline shattered, my genitals neutered, my psyche demolished, my pride trampled and forced into a dress by feminists and DEI and blackrock and zionists, and all you can do is laugh and blame me?

Every single one of these posts is 1pbtid bots attempting to keep pushing the narrative that this was not 100% completely staged and fake. Trump did not get shot; no one got shot; not a single real bullet was fired.
1.) CNN was there livestreaming a Trump rally in the middle of bumfuck nowhere? CNN never streams trump rallies, ever.
2.) Trump's ear has no physical damage. Watch the video. You can see it clear as day, it has blood on it but zero physical damage. Nogunz retards don't understand that bullets tend to obliterate any areas of fleshy mass they impact. A hit to the ear would me a big dangling chunk of flesh. "grazed by a bullet" is hollywood horseshit
3.) The fake gay "bullet caught on camera" photo. That's not how fucking cameras work. Media cameras do not have the capacity to capture a traveling fucking bullet. That's simply not how cameras work.
4.) Secret Service literally dicking around for 10 minutes while Trump waves his fist in front of an American flag. That is not protocol and any retard trying to imply that this was some "b-team" or that they were DEI hires is a fucking mongoloid retard. You're telling me all 10 SS agents ignored protocol for a 10 second photo op in the middle of an active assassination attempt? Shills keep saying "hurrr well they said shooter was neutralized" - if you fucking think for one microsecond that they are not explicitly trained to assume there are multiple attackers using different vectors, you are functionally braindead.

Shills will respond with the same narrative in every thread when you call it staged: "oh you mean they used some random incel to graze his ear? That's implausible!" - NO. NO. NO.
Not a single rational mind would imply this; Only a bot response. It was fake, top-to-bottom.

And Muh Administrative State is just a way to turn everything over to the private sector (with its massive infusions of fed and state welfare ofc), which instead of DEI will just hand out jobs to the cheapest workers and revile founding stock Americans.
Same as it ever was.

My take on the whole thing is this is a hellish consequence of DEI practices and conflicting corporate profits interests. DEI means not hiring the best, but it also means paying people less, because historically women ACCEPT lower wages and are more reluctant to ask for raises. Then there’s cutting corners on repairs. How many Boeing whistleblowers have died? Apparently Boeing has been using substandard replacement components, presumably to save money. Naturally other airlines are going to follow suit to remain competitive. Our government is supposed to provide oversight and prevent these practices but we’re going on four years of Biden’s incompetent, absentee administration (many also DEI hires) and now it’s all starting to fall apart. I absolutely would not fly anywhere right now. It’s only a matter of time before one of these planes with passengers packed in like sardines crashes with no survivors.

Based on news reports, Trump's regular permanent detail was mostly unavailable because he works so long and so hard, they were exhausted and needed a break.
So, most of the team were temp SS and locals.
Maybe there was some confusion about who was responsible for securing the perimeter. SS says they rely on the locals, but wtf? They are in charge, they must assure themselves it was done properly.
And if they rely on locals, why even have their own team on the roof?
The rooftop team were apparently told to stand down. They had eyes on him but couldn't shoot, not even after the sniper shot. This is criminal! As you're probably aware, "Jonathan Willis" says he shot him anyway, but only after the sniper shot first.
So, failure after failure basically, exacerbated by an apparently poorly trained temp DEI SS team, and a bunch of yokels who were likely not up to the job.

It used to be you had to have at least three years of special operations experience to be in Secret Service. Now that “special operations” has expanded to include CSTs, Psy Ops like Lujan, and Civil Affairs, they’re able to DEI prioritize women with little to no tactical experience such as pulling security. Interrogating women or passing out bribes in Afghanistan at best or making leaflets behind a computer screen at Ft Bragg for a few years at worst =/= experience pulling security and identifying threats. Trump legit just needs to hire private security for everything. Secret Service answer to Cheatle and Mayorkas who are both Biden appointees and whose jobs are at risk if Biden loses (which he currently is) and had zero incentive to provide Trump with anything but their bottom of the barrel agents.

Those snipers are white though. Also there was report of someone climbing that roof. If the reports were true, it's likely that it was reported that someone was climbing the building 3 mins ago. That doesn't mean they watched the kid sit there and aim for 3 mins. It sounds like he climbed up and took quick shots without a scope.

We were just centimeters away from a civil war and martial law.

Based off everything that I’ve seen, I’ve read, and what’s happened to America especially within the past 3 years, I would expect a civil war of biblical proportions.

I think people would have reached their breaking points and no longer held back. And if you do a rudimentary analysis, it’s easy to see why.

People would remember when they were locked inside due to COVID measures while feral niggers got to rob and loot gucci and Versace stores and burn police departments down. They would remember the vax mandates, the lying, the gas lighting, our tax dollars that were forcefully taken from us and given to Ukraine, an entire city block that was taken by armed people.

I imagine they would do a hard reset of America from the inside out.

The secret service had a large contingency of women, indicating that the priority for hiring was DEI over actual competence. Just paints a picture for the organization as a whole.

You can still have competent members operating in the organization but overall there was a breakdown in planning and communication and it may not be the fault of those 2 snipers specifically.

The agency has the goal of increasing the number of women to 30 per cent by 2030, but critics claim females make less effective agents than men.

Others claimed the female agents in the presidential candidate’s security detail were too short to properly shield Mr Trump, who is 6ft 3in tall.

Mr Burchett singled out the Secret Service’s adoption of “DEI” – an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion.

“Somebody really dropped the ball. You’ve got a DEI person, a DEI initiative person who heads up our Secret Service,” the representative for Tennessee told Fox News.

“You know she was working at Pepsi before this. I know she was a former CIA Secret Service agent, but still, this is what happens when you don’t put the best players in.”

Ms Cheatle was an agent for 27 years, rising through the ranks, before she joined the soft drinks company as head of security.

Ms Cheatle has faced calls for her resignation from, among others, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk, who claimed her last job was guarding “bags of Cheetos”.

Meghan McCain, the daughter of former presidential nominee John, said on X: “You need to be taller than the candidate to protect them with your body. Why do they have these short women (one who can’t holster a gun apparently) guarding Trump?”

“There should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women,” said Right-wing commentator Matt Walsh on social media.

Quantico has his phone but we're apparently unable to unlock it. Which is bullshit unless it is an iPhone then it might take a day or two. But then again they might not have retained anyone who knows what they are doing and instead have dei hires who will need to ship the phone to Israel to be jailbroke.

Most likely though, and based on evidence and experience, they are lying fucking liars who lie.

Not securing that building or having someone keeping an eye on it should get everyone fired for gross negligence. I can see all this being because of DEI and stupidity. The satellite view of the building makes it look like the biggest danger/security risk to me. Somehow SS didn't think it was their problem and just let the local PD handle it apparently.

Had to be. This is all pretty fucking obvious, but people want to believe their preconceived notions and there is nothing you can do to change their minds.
I'm still not 100% on this being planned but I don't have a definite stance on it. It's still too early for me to judge it and I know I will make up my mind as I have more info, later.
I'm not saying I disagree with you, you just Gabe me more info because I had no idea about CNN weird coverage for example.
I also know just how absolutely incompetent all governagencues are and SS is no exception. It's led by a woman who failed upwards basically and is a DEI hire. So it does not surprise me that they would be that catastrophically incompetent.

That's why we gotta send our best. No DEI on this staff. Only the best brains from Scandi, EU, US, Japan, and South Korea.

No women. The only woman that will be on the payroll at DOCK will be Kasia herself. We can make one exception to bring in Natalia as well if we need to make some modifications to the genetic sequence. Their compensation package will be substantial, complete with special holidays, foundations, and historical monuments in their honor.

We'll have the patents sorted, and initial offers will be available only for Straight white men. One free Kasia per man, with an additional surcharge for additional Kasia's.

Once Whites have stabilized their population numbers, we can put DOCK to work on solutions for bleaching the 2nd and 3rd world. Possibly even a hybrid solution for our Honorary Aryans in the East.

Except it literally isn't. Former presidents are entitled to the same security, and for a good reason. Imagine if someone kidnaps and tortures for info a former president. But, Trump isn't just a former president, he's the Republican nominee and by far the most likely winner of the upcoming elections. So both by law and by common sense he should've had full POTUS protection detail. Which he actually did, except Secret Service is now just a DEI clown show.

Not being able to instantly tell what a credible threat is in realtime is exactly why DEI fucktards and low IQ moroncucks have no place in security services. It is easy to tell fromma persons voice and what they are saying how credible a threat is. You clearly know nothing. There is no excuse for minutes of reports of an impending shooter on a rooftop to go by without removing the package immediately from danger.

Civil wars and rebellions don't happen while people are well-fed and relatively comfortable. Events like the faked election of 2020 can be the spark that lights the fire, but only when the conditions are already there. Look around you: the US economy is in a slow collapse, people are getting more and more agitated, distractions are barely there anymore thanks to DEI.

I don't think current conditions are quite bad enough yet, but we're not that far off. Trump's assassination attempt is yet another piece of kindling to add to the pile. If there's yet another rigged election, that may be the spark. I doubt it though. I think they're going to try to push us into WW3 and THAT is going to cause a civil war or revolution. People will not put up with a draft. I fully believe that.
