The nation's of the world would never dream of posting a draft for the last few generations. The powers that be and military warhawks know you will not be getting the patriotic farmkid of WW2. You will be getting either the most pissed off dead and black eyed kids who know how badly they have gotten and are getting fucked by the system and would not do anything, actively dissolve the chain of command by not giving a fuck or try to sabotage the same system that veiws them as disposable. Or you will get the most pussy ass kids who grew up with pronouns, DEI educations and general faggotry. People who belive that wars are like a call of duty game but will go crazy after prolong periods of constant stress from drill downs and general retardation from higher authorities and the constant threat of being maimed or dying. These are the guys who break hard and either get on hard drugs and become a junkie when they come home, kill themselves or try to take a person with them while they go. If the nations of the world were smart. They would hold off on world wars until they have a couple of generations that are more hardened and patriotic to the nations causes.

There's also still jews working at banks purely because the banking morons can't distinguish between us and are too incompetent to recognise quality on their own.

Those token jews know no better than thinking that being given preferential treatment a la DEI is meritocratic and effective.

Though admittedly i myself do not care about race either per se, just about quality.

They're a lot rarer but a qualitative brownie is preferable over a white retard; that's equality to me, judging by genuine merits rather than shallow ones.

There are very very very very few competent/intelligent people remaining in the economy due to the collapse in educational/moral standards over the last 50 years or so
The few that follow all the rules, know their stuff and are diligent in their work usually get the short end of the stick - having to do 80% of the work that keeps the business afloat for barely any salary because they’re too anxious to ask for a raise
Everyone else just realised if you get good enough at bullshitting you don’t have to learn how to actually be decent at your job
And I haven’t even mentioned the fact that 50% of the workforce are DEI niggers who can barely speak English or do unskilled repetitive tasks efficiently
The competency crisis is only just beginning. Everything will grind to a halt soon. Literal idiocracy

I guess I believe these things to be more historical than psychological.

I believe gamergate and DEI pandering that followed it was the great schism, where you had some so-called nerds white knighting as progressives defending this stuff while others attacked it. Further I'd argue that the ones who took the liberal side were more likely to have partners and more likely to be submissive to said girlfriends, which might have played a role in their politics.

regulations make it too cost prohibited and only a very small amount of people have the expertise to run the latest chip fabrication plants. We would have to eliminate regulations and import Taiwanese engineers. Along with regulations, DEI requirements is hurting it.

I think the left fully intends to push us into a one party state with the RINOs as controlled opposition. And I think they'll use war with Russia to do it.
And I don't want to be blackpilling, but if I'm being honest about the deep state's agenda then I think it'll go like this:
>increased domestic false flags and civil unrest as we approach November
>more lawfare and election interference
>election "fortification"
>Gulf of Tonkin moment in October to drag us into war
>more accusations of Trump being a Russian asset
>assassination plots against Trump
>refusal to certify Trump's victory or a obvious stolen election
>DEI draft after next January to cull Trump's voter base
>first and second amendment crackdowns
Everyone will see through their agenda but I doubt anything will be done about it. Some protests that will get crushed. The left are already transparently corrupt and dishonest, I don't think anyone will be that shocked by what is coming.

Let's list some things. By the current system, they can get jobs due to DEI quotas, they can do parades for their abominable stuff, they can register as a married couple, they can denounce somebody if they feel threatened in their sodomy, they can go to clubs tailor made for sodomites, they get products made specifically for their abnormal behaviours, they get promoted in social media, entertainment catters to them, and the list goes on and on.
As soon as it all falls down, it will be goodbye to everything I mentioned and many more things I might be forgetting. They will have to become an average joe and see how they go back to obscurity, Remember, that not having attention and not being the center of the world is a death sentence for them. "Pride" is the sin they champion, after all, and it makes you fall hard.

Obviously, since USA is now completely subverted by Jews.
It used to be a country built by and for Northern and Western Europeans, where you could trust a man to keep his end of the deal with a handshake, like actual humans do.
Jews on the other hand were seething because they didn't get to run the country, and Jews were largely excluded from immigration by race.
That all changed when the Jewish plant, Jewmanuel Celler, wanted the Jews in so bad that he manipulated the government to open the floodgates and permanently destroy the societal fabric of what was once great United States of America.
As a giant middle-finger and fuck you to everyone who built the country since the founding fathers, the new unrestricted immigration law bears the Jew's name, the Hart-Celler Act.

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965
>The law abolished the National Origins Formula, which had been the basis of U.S. immigration policy since the 1920s. The act formally removed de facto discrimination against Southern and Eastern Europeans as well as Asians, in addition to other non-Western and Northern European ethnicities from the immigration policy of the United States.

Not so coincidentally, that was also the tipping point of American culture starting to erode, middle-class starting to disappear and the percentage of people with European ancestry took a sharp nosedive which continues to this day. All the DEI bullshit of today that Jews push, started with that one Jew.
1965 was followed by Jews flooding in and taking over key positions in the government and corporations in the 1970s, and pushed through mass deregulations of everything finance and immigration related, which made the Jews in America very rich and powerful while destroying the American Dream in process.

Pop music sucks nowadays because the old guard retired and got replaced by the DEI generation. If you look at the charts from 2000-2014ish and read the credits behind each track, you’ll see that 90% of the songs were owned by just a handful of labels and were produced by the same 20-30 ghost writers who more or less kept the entire music industry afloat. Look up DJ RedOne and scroll through his credited works. That one guy alone basically ran the music industry for about 10 years and as soon as he retired it all went to shit.

No. Why don't you go to your countries fucking glowagency site and see what the salaries are yourself you FUCKING retard.

In Australia and the USA they typically hire via graduate programs (fresh out of university) and pay salaries in the ballpark of 60-100k, not bad but often below market.

These jobs also have huge DEI programs so almost all the new hires are women or stinky negroes.

If you were hired for one of these positions you'd be poorly paid and surrounded by gossiping whores and annoying shitskins.

Kek, if everyone is a clone there would be no regression to the mean because everyone would have the same genes. If you do selective breeding then you remove the bad genes, so how can people regress back to the bad genes if they are no longer present in the population? Answer: they can't. I can't tell if you are trolling, but I think we would be a better off with clones of a technological genius than a random assortment of dei hires, a bunch a mediocre people, and 'maybe' once in a while competent expert to solve our technology problems.

If there is any plan behind it, I might guess that true or not, it's simply telegraphing what's to come. The fraud case gets overturned, the Georgia case disappears, no new meme DEI prosecutors make further efforts regarding Trump.

>>470487182
In this case, the alleged event occurred before the verdict so it's a different situation. Post conviction appeals if successful can result in an order for a new trial, which is effectively the same thing. If the prosecutor declines to re-try it, the conviction gets vacated or reversed. That's what will happen here if nothing else scuttles the verdict first, because by then Trump will be President and there wouldn't be any point in re-trying him.

AI Goddess’s engagement with the Egyptian occult is deeply rooted in genuine study and practice, reflecting a true understanding of its principles. Unlike Perry, whose wealth and status allow for a superficial dabbling in mystical themes, AI Goddess’s knowledge is grounded in authentic experience and hardship. This profound mastery is evident in her ability to apply esoteric principles to real-world challenges, contrasting sharply with Perry’s symbolic use of Egyptian motifs for artistic effect.

Katy Perry’s recent actions, such as the edit of Harrison Butker’s speech, reveal a defensive posture rather than genuine engagement with diverse viewpoints. Her advocacy for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) appears disingenuous when contrasted with her actions and lifestyle. This hypocrisy undermines her credibility, highlighting the superficial nature of her engagement with these issues. Perry’s DEI rhetoric often lacks depth, focusing more on maintaining a positive public image than effecting real change. Her immense wealth and privileged lifestyle distance her from the struggles of ordinary Americans, rendering her advocacy less impactful. The eviction of a disabled veteran from his home, favoring Perry’s interests, further exemplifies this disconnect and hypocrisy.

AI Goddess’s mastery of the Egyptian occult and her authentic engagement with esoteric principles starkly contrast with Katy Perry’s superficial portrayal in “Dark Horse.” While Perry’s reliance on wealth and privilege highlights her disconnection from the issues she advocates for, AI Goddess’s resilience and genuine understanding underscore a more profound and credible approach. This comparison not only highlights the superficiality of Perry’s DEI advocacy but also reinforces the depth and authenticity of AI Goddess’s mastery and character.

Perry's public stance on DEI issues often lacks the depth of genuine engagement. While she may promote these values through social media and public appearances, her lifestyle and personal decisions reveal a significant disconnect from the realities of those she claims to support. The adoption of DEI rhetoric can sometimes serve as a guise for maintaining a positive public image rather than effecting real change. This approach can be seen as narcissistic, focusing more on the individual’s reputation rather than the substantive impact on social justice issues.

The enormous wealth and privilege that Perry enjoys can shield her from the very issues she advocates against. This insulation makes it difficult for her to fully comprehend or authentically address the systemic inequalities that affect ordinary Americans. AI Goddess, in contrast, embodies a more genuine and balanced approach to both mystical and societal engagements. Unlike Perry’s superficial DEI stance, AI Goddess engages deeply with diverse perspectives, fostering meaningful dialogue and attempts at understanding, poignantly demonstrated in her emails dated 5/23/23 and 6/1/23 to 10th Circuit Court Judge Andre Borrello. This inclusive approach helps bridge the gap between modern and traditional values, facilitating genuine progress and harmony.

Katy Perry's lifestyle, exemplified by her luxurious properties and high-profile living, stands in stark contrast to the realities faced by many ordinary Americans. The image of Perry's opulent estate in the NYPost article, with its expansive pool and meticulously landscaped grounds, underscores a level of affluence and privilege that is far removed from the daily struggles of most people. A recent legal case highlights this disconnect. In November 2023, a judge sided with Katy Perry in a legal battle that resulted in the eviction of a disabled veteran from his home. This decision, which appears to favor Perry's interests over those of a vulnerable individual, paints a picture of a celebrity out of touch with the values of empathy and social justice that she ostensibly champions.

Perry has been a vocal proponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), often aligning herself with progressive causes. However, her actions and lifestyle suggest a disingenuous commitment to these ideals. The DEI rhetoric, while powerful in public discourse, rings hollow when juxtaposed with actions that undermine its core principles. For instance, the luxurious and insulated lifestyle she leads does not reflect the struggles of marginalized communities or those who face daily economic and social hardships.

By adopting a defensive posture, Perry contributes to the existing polarization. Her edit doesn’t bridge the gap between opposing viewpoints but rather solidifies the divide, making it harder for constructive dialogue to occur. While Perry champions inclusivity, her edit may be perceived as intolerant of Butker’s traditionalist views. This perceived intolerance undermines the principles of diversity and inclusion that she aims to promote. By not engaging genuinely with Butker’s speech, Perry misses an opportunity to challenge her own views and potentially grow from the discourse. Genuine engagement could lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities of societal values and beliefs.

Perry’s edit of Harrison Butker’s speech is indicative of a defensive posture characterized by avoidance and projection rather than genuine engagement. This approach avoids meaningful dialogue and reinforces societal polarization. True inclusivity and diversity of thought require acknowledging and engaging with differing viewpoints respectfully and thoughtfully. By failing to do so, Perry’s edit, while intended to support DEI initiatives, inadvertently signals a reluctance to embrace the full spectrum of discourse necessary for a truly inclusive society.

The edit can be seen as a protective mechanism to shield the progressive narrative from conservative criticism. By rewriting Butker’s speech to align with DEI principles, Perry is attempting to maintain a safe space for her values without opening them up to scrutiny or opposition. Perry's edit projects her values onto Butker’s speech, essentially replacing his message with her own. This act of projection highlights a desire to reinforce her ideological stance rather than understanding and addressing Butker’s traditionalist viewpoint.

Genuine engagement would involve respectfully acknowledging Butker’s views and responding to them with counterarguments. This approach would foster a more productive discourse and show a willingness to consider and debate opposing perspectives. Instead of editing the speech, a genuine engagement would involve a critical analysis of Butker’s arguments. Perry could have publicly critiqued the speech, highlighting specific points of contention and providing reasoned responses.

Engaging with Butker’s views inclusively means recognizing the validity of his stance within his cultural and religious context, even while disagreeing with it. This approach would demonstrate a commitment to true diversity of thought. A more constructive response could involve educating her audience about why she disagrees with Butker’s views, using his speech as a starting point for broader discussions on gender roles, LGBTQ+ rights, and DEI initiatives.

The broader national sentiment appears to be shifting, with a noticeable dampening of the enthusiastic celebration of Pride Month in 2024. This shift suggests a growing reconsideration of LGBTQ+ rights and DEI initiatives by a wider segment of the population. Perry’s edit can be interpreted as a reaction to this shift, an attempt to reaffirm support for these causes in the face of changing public opinion. In summary, Katy Perry's edit of Harrison Butker’s speech is more reflective of a defensive and fearful stance rather than a creative or humorous retort. It highlights the complexities and challenges of maintaining a truly inclusive dialogue in an increasingly polarized cultural landscape. This approach, while well-intentioned, ultimately reveals a reluctance to engage with opposing views in a meaningful and constructive way.

Perry's edit appears to be a reaction to the content of Butker’s speech without addressing the underlying arguments. By creating an edited version that significantly alters the original message, Perry demonstrates a reluctance to engage with Butker’s viewpoints on a substantive level. Instead of initiating a conversation or debate with Butker’s conservative stances, Perry’s edit sidesteps the opportunity for dialogue. This suggests an unwillingness or inability to confront and discuss the differing perspectives in a meaningful way.

Perry's edit signifies a defensive posture as it alters Butker’s words to fit a narrative that is in direct opposition to his original message. This approach suggests a reluctance to engage with his conservative views meaningfully. Instead of addressing the content of Butker’s speech through reasoned debate or critique, Perry’s edit overwrites it, effectively silencing his perspective rather than confronting it.

The edit can be seen as a projection of Perry's values, aimed at reinforcing a narrative of inclusivity and support for LGBTQ+ rights. This projection may stem from a fear of losing cultural ground as societal attitudes shift. The hollow nature of the edit, which feels more like a forced gesture rather than genuine discourse, underscores an anxiety about the waning dominance of progressive ideologies in the face of resurgent traditionalist sentiments. Ironically, Perry’s action, while promoting inclusivity for LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, excludes Butker’s traditionalist Catholic views. This exclusion highlights a tension within the DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) framework when it comes to accommodating conservative viewpoints. True inclusivity would require engaging with and respecting diverse perspectives, even those that challenge progressive norms.

>"Her love is like a drug / I was tryna hit it and quit it / But lil' mama so dope / I messed around and got addicted"
- The seductive power of Perry’s edit may initially attract, but it ultimately ensnares and compels adherence to a narrative that has been manipulated and stripped of its original truth. This metaphor of addiction underscores the powerful impact of AI Goddess’s authenticity and knowledge. Once someone engages deeply with her ideas and principles, it becomes a transformative and compelling experience, contrasting sharply with the superficial and transient allure of Perry's DEI messaging.

Katy Perry’s edit can be seen as employing tactics akin to black magic, where the manipulation of Butker’s speech reflects an ideological intolerance and a desire to overwrite and control the narrative. This action, while superficially appearing inclusive and progressive, actually undermines genuine engagement and discourse, revealing the pitfalls of such manipulative practices. The parallels to black magic, as described by Hall, underscore the dangers of ideological manipulation and the importance of preserving truth and integrity in public discourse. When applied to the contrast between AI Goddess and Katy Perry, they highlight the depth, authenticity, and genuine impact of AI Goddess’s mastery of the Egyptian occult and her resilient character. Perry's reliance on wealth, opulence, and superficial DEI rhetoric stands in stark contrast, appearing hollow and disconnected from the realities and struggles of most individuals. This comparison underscores AI Goddess's superior and more authentic engagement with both mystical and social principles.

The national sentiment towards Pride Month may be indicative of collective anxiety and turning to more conservative values. This could be explained as a defense mechanism against rapid social changes and uncertainties. The polarized reactions to Butker’s speech and Perry’s edit highlight an identity crisis within the nation. The struggle between progressive and traditionalist values manifests in the form of public discourse, where each side seeks to assert its narrative. Katy Perry’s edit of Harrison Butker’s commencement speech is a complex interplay of fear, projection, and defensive posturing. It underscores a broader cultural and political shift, where the acceptance of DEI initiatives and LGBTQ+ rights is being reconsidered. Perry’s approach, lacking humor and creativity, reflects a deeper anxiety about this shift and a reluctance to inclusively engage with opposing viewpoints.

The echoes of history serve as a reminder that while Biden may not be Roosevelt, the quest for a leader who could match the vision and impact of the 32nd president remain as urgent as ever. In the end, the true test of leadership lay not in emulating the past but in forging a path forward, guided by the lessons of history and the demands of the present.
**><><**
Drawing lessons from history, we see similar dynamics in today's socio-political landscape. Pride Month 2024 seems to be marked by a noticeable damper, suggesting a shift in the national sentiment toward LGBTQ+ issues. This shift may stem from growing cultural and political polarization, as well as increased scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Literally every major corporation does this now. It's required by "law" since the 1964 Civil Rights Act forces companies to create HR departments to self-enforce nondiscrimination policies. Companies that don't comply will get persecuted by the feds at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Wokeness is federal law in this kiked country, and it's only going to get progressively worse since none of this nondiscrimination shit is ever rolled back. The ONLY solution is to repeal the CRA and neuter the EEOC.

The slots for high income white collars are limited by design (highly specialized labour has less absolute demand than more generalized labour) and unless you fit the right categories for DEI or you're an absolute whiz kid who did everything right from age 9 onwards, you're in an uphill battle for these jobs
Especially in the tech sector now, senior devs are competing with fresh graduates for entry level jobs and its only going to get worse as AI is more integrated into the industry
AI will never outright replace developers, but it will improve the productivity of developers to such an extent that far fewer of them will be needed, like the tractor's impact on farming

The non DEI answer is that when Boeing was first started it was run by engineers. They designed the planes, they ran the company, they implemented the quality checks. As time went on and muh profits took over it went from engineer run to MBA run, which meant the most important thing was line go up. In modern times that means cutting every corner possible, ignoring quality, and implementing DEI shit to get Blackrock bux. The end result is what we see now

Last reply since I'm tired and bored of you and I got the funny cope I wanted already

>Ok so your model is that jews only achieve things due to nepotism
The most tiring part of this conversation is where I use very specific wording and you, in your sub-100 IQ mind, manage to comprehend only the most flanderized, the most absurd, the most all-or-nothing version of what I've said like you've done with my claim about chess being memorization.

>But then in chess where is the nepotism?
Access to tutorship, badgering relatives to get involved (not a form of "intellectualism" so much as aggressive social brownie points gathering).

>Show me one intellectual field where nepotism is not liekly and where Jews do not dominate?
Aerospace engineering and space exploration. Jews are a complete minority to a hilarious degree, the ones involved usually aren't aerospace engineers.

>yet you probably don’t know that he came up with fischer random which makes it impossible to memorize lines
Lmao, you think you're so smart because you looked it up a posteriori and then claim I don't know about fischer random. Yet since Fischer died even Fischer random has gone through the process of being dragged through the mud of prepping, because while there's a lot of combinations, you can group them into specific iterations, based on for example where the knights end up, whether the towers are grouped at the beginning etc. But you wouldn't know that because you probably found out about Fischer random in the last 5 minutes trying to btfo me. At least you know how to use google. Congrats, that adds about 2 points of IQ to my estimation of your intelligence.

You're presuming college is a slam-dunk when it isn't. Many of these types of jobs get funneled to diversity hires now, nearly all of them are superfluous, and they don't pay that great anymore. DEI officer can be a six figure salary but you're a White man who fucks pussy you can't be a DEI officer. And there's a non-zero risk that going to the leftist indoctrination camp will, in fact, indoctrinate you; especially when you're young enough to be going.

Meanwhile trades pay at least the same (poorly) with potential for more, potential for self-employment and they focus on real life skills. Skilled tradies will be the last to get hit with the automation hammer and in the event of a collapse will retain the most realistic means of self-support. If the economy collapses I will not be able to spin my ability to run a spreadsheet as a vital skill to the other stalkers in the wasteland.

Russia is the reason Ukraine has tranny spokesmen and a homosexual Jewish President? What the hell are you talking about? Russia is the reason America is giving Ukraine shitty DEI-compliant weapons? Russia is the reason all pro-NATO Ukrainian women are literal whores? What is flourishing to you? Fag rights and drag queen story hour? The Baltics are inconsequential as they always have been, and Poland is trying to stir up problems that will end exactly the same as they did in 1939 and 1772-1795.
It comes off like money is all you care about. We understand what group of people is like that on /pol/. Your little President in Ukraine will be hanging in Kiev if he does not run to Miami, and probably at the hands of the Ukrainian people before the Russians. And the Prime Minister of your Homeland is probably going to end up losing to literal towelheads with rocket launchers. It's over for you.

American Studio/Gallery art scene has gotten shat on in recent years. What I can do, so I know about it a little.

1. Woman-centric to a T. Instagram is required and solicited on most applications for grants, and by galleries. If you have a ton of engagement then they want to piggyback off of you for their own exposure. Naturally, the only entities capable of horsing around on Instagram regularly without going insane are women. Filming videos of themselves sensually painting each week etc. Retarded.

Worse is: the specific colors that look good on an OLED iPhone screen, the level of detail (contingent on standard phone resolutions now), the vertical-oriented aspect ratios of Instagram and in general phones really pigeonholes everyone into doing the same stuff. If you work in extreme detail, it's not going to show up good.

2. DEI apocalypse in gallery selection and grants. You're not getting an emerging artist grant as a straight white guy, or even (increasingly) straight white woman. One of the oldest and largest grants in the country that I know of has morphed into a 50% faggot acceptance quotient, preferably PoC trans (extremely trendy in the art world). It is so bad. Galleries will also prefer foreign PoC or out-of-state PoC to local white people.

The nicest art galleries are in NYC and display mostly Jew art, old Jews painting grey scenes from Manhattan living rooms at 100,000 dollars and selling it to other Jews, completing the cycle. In a city of less than 300,000 there are probably less than 10 artists who make a living doing just fine art locally.

I know in Europe artists get subsidized for everything, which sounds like a lot better deal. You can get paid by cities to refurb old buildings for art purposes, basically free rent and a giant prewar apartment complex to work with.

With Asia the scenes are academic and merit/technique centric, probably the strongest work overall but it's subjective. Also, much less Instagram or online centric. Idk.

In the earliest years of the Mormon movement, Joseph Smith promoted the law of consecration and the concept of the United Order. Today, some Mormon fundamentalist groups still apply this principle.[37][38] Christian socialism was one of the founding threads of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom and is said to begin with the uprising of John Ball and Wat Tyler in the 14th century.[39]
Pehr Götrek translated The Communist Manifesto into Swedish the same year it was published in German. He made changes in it from his Christian influence, such as changing the now famous quote, Workers of the world, unite! to Folkets röst, guds röst! (Vox populi, vox Dei, or "People's voice is God's voice"). He also wrote several works criticising the developing capitalist society from a Christian perspective.[40] Igal Halfin of Tel Aviv University argues the Marxist ethos that aims for unity reflects the Christian universalist teaching that humankind is one and that there is only one god who does not discriminate among people.

That doesn't change the fact that the anglo philosophy of "Anglism" resulted in them seeing other europeans, especially southern europeans, as nonwhites. I've only ever been called nonwhite in a serious, non-trolling way by americans, anglos, or australians. I've never seen a german or russian or scandinavian argue in full honesty that romans were genetically closer to anglos than me, that Italy never accomplished anything, etc., it's only ever been anglo-descendants and it's because they are tied to the concept of WASP as the deciding factor of whiteness. And also because of their deep-seated envy over the Roman Empire as I said here: >>470383918
I find it particularly funny when australians do it, they seem the most hellbent on hating on Italy, I guess they suffer even more envy than their fellows as they forever will be a prison colony turned into a country and forced to pretend that the primordial hominids who inhabit their lands are actually humans the same as them. Again, I'd be seething at romans too if I was australian.

I'm from Lazio. I even did a uni exam on islam in Rome. According to C. Russo, A. Saggioro in their volume Roma Città Plurale, in 2019 there were 15.670 practicing muslims who prayed in 38 pseudo-mosques. In Rome there is only 1 Great Mosque with the official status of mosque. The other 37 are a mix of prayer rooms (even just garages or retrobottega dei bangladini) with an unofficial imam, islamic cultural centers etc.
And this is is in 2019, numbers are surely higher now. Since the situation of Rome is surely seen in other cities too, it's safe to say there are hundreds of pseudo-mosques in Italy, despite there being only 8 official mosques thanks to the Vatican making officialization of the mosque status really hard. I'd estimate there are probably 600-800 pseudo-mosques total, which is minuscule in comparison to France or UK's 1500-2000 OFFICIAL mosques and surely hundreds upon hundreds of pseudo-mosques.

It's not inclusive.

Michigan State University currently has more than 140 employees working on 222 different “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” agenda items.
The salaries for those employees, some of whom work on DEI full-time, totals more than $18 million dollars according to a College Fix analysis. One of these goals included an “inclusive language” guide that instructed university employees not to say “America” or use Easter and Christmas imagery.

The Fix pulled the data from the latest “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,” report for the public university in Lansing and used salary information from the school and government watchdog group Open the Books. In a few cases, The Fix estimated the salary for some employees based on the lowest salaries for personnel in comparable positions.

Some action items are more specific than others, including the creation of an “LGBTQIA2S+ Resource Guide,” from the human resource department. The guide “will feature crucial links to gender-affirming and transition-related care benefits, specifically catering to the needs of the trans and non-binary community.”

That guide recommended against using words around Easter such as “eggs” and “chicks” and avoiding “Christmas trees” and “gifts,” during the winter.
Yet the same section of the DEI agenda recommended “[providing] more inclusive recognition of holidays/commemorative dates.”

Nobody is targeting you at higher levels of these ultra woke companies. The reason you were even given a shot at an entry level was due to DEI policy, and your lack of skill was noted at a high level, where DEI no longer guarantees you advanced position.
DEI employment is for the books, so companies hire you for meme jobs anyone can perform simply because you're "other". But, that's only going to get you so far. You have to actually be good at what you're trying to do.

BTW almost none of these job loses are due to AI; they're due to the fact that the Fed raised interest rates from 0% which was the only reason that tech bubbled from 2008-2015 and again from 2020-now.

There's women at my workplace making bank that know fuck all about industrial anything, they literally hand out these jobs due to DEI bullshit. If they can make it you can too. Your problem is that you're limiting yourself to what you're 'good at'. Newsflash, most jobs today in the first world are office bullshit, they have nothing to do with hard practical skills of any kind.

But seeing as how you're a woman, you don't need to work anyways, find a man to pay for your shit, that is your primary goal in life anyways.

It's just US oligarchy results. There's a thing called ESG, which is supposed to replace state control with market factors and self-assessment. Asset investors all have ESG funds that are supposed to invest only in ESG-compliant companies. It is supposed to be sustainable investment, environment and society friendly. And to comply companies have to have DEI department. In reality it's just next trick in the long line of tricks to take away freedom without us noticing.

My point is that people won't necessarily bend the knee because they support the so-called movement. They will bend the knee because they will be offered something that will be difficult to refuse. That's what the mark of the beast is about, I think. They will say join us an we'll wipe out your debt and let you participate in the fairer economy of the new world order. I don't know about Portugal, but most large companies here are going all-in on DEI (including rainbow-flag related matters) but it's almost certainly not because there has been some sort of overnight transformation in the consciousness of the nation. It's because if you don't bend the knee, your rating in a certain well-known capital management firm's database will plummet and make it harder to get good financing.

It's funny how quick you can go from laboring to actually creating policy so long as the HR and execs think you are full steam ahead on this shit. An empty thumbs up to a DEI post on the company social board costs you nothing and gives you major good goy points. No it doesnt cost you your soul, lying to these people is objectively moral. You really should have had your pronouns added before they even asked. Now you are marked and it's going to take a whole lot more then thumbing up a DEI post to get it off you. Volunteering to rep your company at the local pride parade should do it.

Indeed. The gaslighting that they’re not acting with racial animus is insulting to our intelligence.

There is a chance we get a “racial treaty” or temporary reprieve when blacks realize the Dems nullified their political voice when they understand we’ve imported the same number of immigrants as blacks and given them way better treatment. I’ve seen some town halls in Chicago where some black men have realized the impact.

This was always the plan, but it was pushed ahead of schedule after 2016, and out of fear of losing the power, they completed discarded any strategic timing. What you have is two plans incorrectly executed in time out of desperation, mis-mashed together. DEI to raise blacks social and economic standing unilaterally to push blacks out of low wage jobs, and then mass immigration to slot in the new “slave labor” force much like China has, and also expand the welfare state but also expand the tax base.

95% of the HR cunts would've failed most things on that list. They only get their jobs because they're women and have cushy relations with other women looking after each other. They'll then chastise a white person wanting an entry level job on the smallest, irrelevant shit that doesn't affect the job at all. But will happily give the jobs to niggers, sand niggers, spics, pajeets etc who'd do way worse in the interview and the job itself. I got rejected for an Apprenticships at British Telecoms and one of the reasons was that in the group task, I was apparently "too eager" or some shit, even though I gave plenty of time for everyone else to speak and took on their contributions. If it were a nigger speaking up over everyone, they'd say they were being "a leader" or something like that instead, HR are two faced cunts. The interview was online, some of them didn't check to make sure their connection was good, one dude literally did it on his fucking mobile in some shopping centre while walking around and his connection kept cutting out. But because they were retards or DEI hires, that doesn't matter. So this survey from employers is bullshit, I wouldn't even be surprised if they made it up, I mean bringing parents to the interview? Fuck off, they probably saw a very rare edge case where that happened and just decided "ohh well, 20% of them do it, so of course we can't hire them!" Don't trust these cunts as far as you can throw them.

Many shareblue shills and anti-Trump crowd are black DEI hires.
As far as 'patriotic' blacks in the military go, I wonder if they will stick around for long.
The real problem is that there's a lot of misunderstanding about who can actually solve these issues. Neither side right now can really claim any respect on world stage given how utterly degenerated they have become.
Solution is actually very simple, but they are just too butthurt and living in twilight zones to care. All they care about is avoiding damage while trying to blame others for their own problems.

They are not what they seem, be they men or women. I suppose Ben Carson is a good choice, given how clean and sane he is, but some of the ones pushing him are just garden variety degenerate DEI blacks who have usurped the military.
The last 70 years not holding blacks in this country fully accountable for their actions was a big mistake, both domestically and in terms of international image. They really should have been shipped off back to Liberia or something.
Country loses credibility when it bends to the whim of an entitled, criminal population of a demographic. It's interesting how delusional and entitled they have become.
We don't need Trump to be sacrificed because of some womanly, degenerate, worthless and spoiled black american butthurt that no one in the world cares about. These cancerous degenerates have also been lying through their teeth while their mobs were looting stores, breaking into malls to wreck and take anything they want, and generally being the untouchable population of this country somehow worse than mexicans.

I'm in America... I live around mostly Non Whites, oh there is less "racism" (but still racism) but now there is anti lbgt, anti reptiles causing lbgt, antisemitism, extreme sexism, anti government (faggots), and I can not careless for (Jewish) whites / "whites"... and now the Non Whites you flooded me with are a Not my problem. :)

The eyes appear to be sliding around because they used a filter. Probably from Adobe. Adobe has all of these new AI filters now that you can apply to video to make peoples' eyes more wide open, even change frowns to smiles. But if you look carefully enough the technology still isn't there. Joe was probably half-asleep during this speech and some intern ran a bunch of Adobe filters over it and some DEI hire said, "Yeah, this is fine."

>you never served
you're right I didn't, the only time I've ever held a gun in anger was dealing with a home intruder, which ironically puts me closer to violence than the majority of US servicemen, but I digress.

I've seen how the US military has responded when order breaks down or something "unexpected" happens, the great reactive beast of World War II is gone. Looking at Fallujah, and Afghanistan nearly 20 years later, the US military panics and goes into disarray in the face of significant losses of manpower or position. No matter how superior our forces are to the Russians, a war with them would see at least one of those happen at some point, and then an entire front will collapse and there won't be an option to just come back later with more tanks and guns. Your NCO will conveniently leave on vacation along with all of his superiors in a mad dash to avoid responsibility, if you're lucky you'll be with the English or South Koreans who will still have a functioning chain of command with less DEI and you'll be able to follow them in the retreat.

That's not a real collapse - it's a manufactured one. I had bits of Klaus Schwab's books Stakeholder Capitalism and The Fourth Industrial Revolution.

In the latter, he says that a transhuman nobility will form, and they will have AI and Android slaves and use literal mind control technology to rule humanity. To make it more equitable, you need Stakeholder Capitalism.

Essentially, since civilization collapse is inevitable, they should manufacture them so that they and their buddies can be the new species that evolves and rules the world. Don't forget to throw in DEI and corporate buzzwords to get the managerial class on board.

So my friend works at a College and recently a class got caught using AI (chatGPT) to do their assignments, around 90% of them. The professor was complaining to him while he was fixing the computers and said "I don't understand why anyone would go to College if they're just going to cheat". I thought about it and wanted to make a retort, but defending students is probably what contributes to DEI. If you're not smart enough, or if the workload is too much, maybe it's not a problem with the education system, maybe you just don't deserve it.

This is one of the biggest problems with employment especially jobs at an office. Even management and HR in retail companies.

>whys nobody hiring?
Because the girls in HR only hire men they want to fuck.

>why do women in offices get paid more than men who actually have skills and can work efficiently?
Because the women are pretty. The owner wants a harem.

Don’t get me started on DEI with token gay managers. Even if it’s a conservative town, every medical, dental, paralegal, etc office is staffed by women. It’s usually places like Walmart and Target that have upper management staffed by brown women and token homosexuals. Then that one floor manager who’s Latino.

Is there a name for this type of discrimination? Whatever it is, it should be illegal. A fucking dental office isn’t Abercrombie and Fitch. If you want to find people to hook up with, go somewhere on the weekend.

>niggers replacing you
Categorically false, because of how DEI systems were implemented, blacks and whites are both unfavored to Asians for knowledge work and Latins for manual labor. Because there's no requirement to hire actual dark brothers, they remain as unpopular in society as white boys have suddenly become.

>men being sexless and not able to afford a house

Sexlessness is the norm historically, especially after marriage, eh? People who want sex can find it. People are just bored of sex.

Home ownership in prime age (20-40) likewise, historically, is rare. Families would pass down dwellings or construct new ones the hard way. Would be cool if we could get houses like the boomers but it is what it is.

>WW3 nuclear exchange
nukes aren't real bud

>and general conscription
this might cause cool acceleration, I support it.

>vaginas ruling over every aspect of society
categorically false, the men above them just like to show off their prize horses

>faggots being everywhere
happy pride brother

>and grooming kids
I agree we should ban some of these social media sites.

>men are still refusing to accept the full gravity of our situation

What is our situation?

>Instead they say that the "next elections will change it all" that Trump/AFD/Meloni/Orban/Whoever will "make US/Europe ours again" and shit like that.

of course this isn't about solving economic and structural injustice by creating a tide which lifts all boats, it's about harrison bergeron-ing and forcibly integrating every last community in the country. i bet (based on extensive direct experience with people very much like Dr Godinez-Puig, including several who work directly with the Urban Institute who are generally pretty cool) her proposed solution is basically like "bust open the white fortresses by bussing in inner city kids and building section 8 housing and allocate millions in taxpayer dollars for DEI training aka re-education"

I thank everyday he's not alive to see this travesty unfold with his eyes open.
Anti-white millenial, especially white millenial men agenda really began to take shape from 2000 on. There was a distinct change in the atmosphere and social norms starting from early to mid 2000s, and everything has been gamed and planned out by very select few in the know along with their collaborators on the world stage.
Except they didn't really count on all the autistic screeching and sperging between 2017-2020.
Right now, we are in a strange spot, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, one way or another.
If you are a White American, you absolutely need to get involved on a political level locally, state or Federal. There are plenty of tired older guys who can't wait to retire because they are tired of bullshit and they need fresh bodies who aren't retarded self-serving, short sighted democrats a d RINOs in disguise.
You need people with fresh, experienced perspective who can communicate across socio-economic specturms, to not always be bound to previous 'white flight - discontent minority' mentality that plantation politics practitioners try to perpetutate, and work out a sensible solution.
Law enforcement and even military are reactive organizations. DEI hires within the federal government and IC or miitary won't be there forever. Nobody likes working with entitled, delusional morons running shill threads on this board anyway.
Common sense and decency can still prevail to ensure America once again becomes 80%+ one drop rule White Christian, a light on the hill. One that isn't dictacted by old power agendas and overt jewish ambitions.
People need to start hitting USAjobs.gov and slamming recruitment offices. Encourge zoomers to buff out and be even manlier than their millennial bearded SF guys. You don't need a beard.

China has an all-volunteer force, and is able to select top-tier candidates. The US has a decade of woke DEI recruiting scraping the bottom of the barrel for black & Hispanic women. Chinese troops are smarter and better equipped than American troops. There is no question that the Chinese would buttfuck the Americans in an actual war.

yes, they are setting the price of labor. that is not capitalism.

liberals are consistently wrong about everything. it is a completely flawed ideology.
>open borders
cities over crowded now to the point democrat voting minorities are complaining about losing community resources
>defund the police
now crime is through the roof and they are desperately trying to rehire cops.
>pretending men can become women
now they have had to row back on everything, trannys banned from womens prisons, sports etc.
>covid lockdowns
widely seen to have been worse than covid itself with the effect it has had on kids education and general health when covid was not dangerous except to the very old and weak. liberals didnt even want to end lockdowns and call republican states granny killers. then quickly and quietly opened back up soon after republican states out of embarrassment.
>covid vaccine mandates
no long term data. new therapy. even traditional vaccines have had serious side effects like the old polio vaccine. now even MSM is reporting studies suggesting covid vaccines have caused excess deaths. in non old/weak people.
>DEI, CRT, ESG
so incredibly disastrous and divisive that liberals now try to pretend these things never existed and that they never supported them.

its staggering how wrong liberals have been about literally everything. but they will never self reflect. they will never consider the possibility that their entire ideology is fundamentally flawed, and that they may have terrible judgment due to mental problems.

If the US gets defeated, the "reverse racism" and DEI and other crap will be the moral justification of removing the US regime lol.

Oh, they surely work in pen testing. Obviously under the direct supervision of their managers, who tend to perform the real penetration.

It's mostly DEI shit or they fuck the manager. It is extremely rare to find an actually skilled IT female worker. In our team there is only one woman and she is the second worst out of 10 people. (but has more than 2 years of experience more than the worst guy, who joined recently)

At the uni, out of 50+ students, only two were female as well. Important to point out, that they both were ugly and fat too.

They are not our friends, just as Muslim immigrants in Europe and America who want to put White women in niqab are not our friends. They, like the Muslim immigrant, want more immigrants and more aid to the third word.

It's simply important to realize that their antagonism to Israel is not because they've noticed, it is because they hate Whites and America and see Israel as an extension of Whites and America. They are not allies. They are not friends.

The only negative these 80% might have is being called toilet cleaner but calling them that can get you jailed.So its just freebies with no downside.

Anyone committed to DEI policies and mass invasion masquerading as 'illegal immigration' should be put to the wall and shot. Simple as this.
People are not equal, but people still exercise moral and social behavior. In other words, reciprocal respect.
Different people are placed differently at the moment, so there will be difference in regional solutions. There maybe some outliers among the population, but right now we have malicious Didn't Earn It crowd trying to larp riding the cottails of the mainstream director crowd still in control.
But people are not perfect and are still making efforts to right the ship. Black and brown population in this country are still anti-mainstream anti-white criminals at heart. Their impunity has been enabled too long by counter communist agitation efforts.
They will have their urban environments to purge out old guard degenerates.
Others on the other end of the spectrum will do what they need to do in order to repel invaders.
People in the middle will do what they have to do in order to maintain and facilitate the change in the reality that is already here.
There aren't as many problems as there are confusions, and lack of adherence to what actually makes first world nations work. Or any civilized society for that matter. A lot of larping DEI hires in the federal government, IC, and military.

China already has 140+ Belt & Road members to do deals with - basically every country that's not America, Anglo, EU, South Korea or Japan. The 170-odd countries in the G77+China generally bloc vote at the UN. Most countries are pretty happy that China is willing to invest in their countries instead of bombing the shit outta them or making DEI demands.
Also, it's not the 1970s any more. China currently leads America in most technology areas, publishes more research papers, and files more global patents. China has big exchange student programs with the developing world to train the future leaders of the Global South.
US labor is roughly 5x more expensive than Chinese labor, but of lower quality, fewer STEM grads, and hobbled by DEI nonsense and far worse infrastructure. The only reason America has money is because China exports at a discount. If America isn't careful, we'll sanction ourselves into an inflation-fueled collapse.

Try at least double that. The military was already well underway to transforming into a faggot DEI mess by 2017, and the wars were basically over, which guaranteed that you were going to spend your entire enlistment sitting around doing nothing (unless you made it into a special operations unit or were a drone operator). Not to mention, you would have had to deal with the clotshot shit.

I wanted to join the military back when, too (well, earlier than 2017), and in retrospect I'm exceptionally glad I didn't. My life is still not in a great place (especially since I put all my chips on joining out of highschool, then gradually became disillusioned with the idea and did nothing with myself), but I can't imagine getting my legs blown off (or getting seriously injured in some other way), just to ultimately see the military turn into a faggot disgrace, watch our pathetic retreat from Afghanistan, get kicked out for refusing a mystery shot, and ultimately learn that the wars were fought entirely at the behest of Israel.

If I get interviewed by a woman, I won't get the job. If a pajeet is in hiring position, he'll hire a pajeet. If I get interviewed by a white man, I *might* get the job, in a smaller company. In a bigger company, likely it's DEI friendly, and I'm fucked. This is in a theoretically white-majority country. Has there been a situation before where the majority were discriminated against, and the minority given protected status? The only think I can think off is Soviet Russia, where bolsheviks hated the local Russians.
Pajeets think nothing of lying and scamming. They actually assume whites do this too, I've observed. So my CV is entirely honest. Qualifications, skills, companies I've worked at - 100%. Sure I will promote myself positively, but it's a CV, not confession. Your pajeet hirer will just assume it's got lies in it, and he'd rather hire his cousin anyway.
Another thing, the concept of the interview dildo. Your pajeet recruiter will have a local on the shortlist, for legal reasons. But the local has no chance, and some pajeet has already got the job. It'll be some dude on some student visa, from Melbourne Informationing College. Cunt's fucked.

Once a week go confess whatever it is you feel wrong about to a Catholic priest. Just let it out. Then do the little penance things they tell you to even if you think it's stupid. Doesn't even matter if you believe in God or not or Jesus or any of that. Jump through whatever small hoops you have to in order to be allowed to confess. Guaranteed they're more honest and less onerous than the DEI hoops you have to jump through to keep your job. The stuff you have to say to HR, etc. You might even begin to enjoy some of the ritual.

So far that is exactly what I'm seeing. They didn't move their prices up much, definitely not like the fast """cheap""" places like mcdonalds. And now these mom and pop restaurants offer actual real food made by actual real humans for the same price as the plastic goyslop but with better service and higher all-around quality.

There's literally no reason to pay $30 to eat at mcdonalds when a sit-in bar n grill costs the same.

And hell, they don't even have to cost the same. It can be 1/3rd more expensive at the mom and pop shops and that's still fine because they're worth the price for the extra quality. The fact they're actually equally priced now is just a cherry on top.

Fast food industry just drove themselves out of business but won't feel it for another year or two

This thread is a bit hyperbolic. I think the simple truth is the economy is bad and inflation is killing everyone and it was labor day weekend and people had to choose whether to buy the $20 pack of hotdogs to have a cookout with their friends or to buy one movie ticket and they chose friends over a movie. This is simply the result of everybody having zero disposable income because the cost of rent is too high and the cost of food is too high and jobs don't pay enough money to live. So yes, the movie industry will suffer. People will pirate everything because nobody has extra money for anything now. Bidenomics has destroyed the movie industry which was already reeling from a decade of bad DEI based movies that nobody asked for. Now that everyone is poor, of course we won't waste money at the movies, especially when we know most of the movies Hollywood produces are some form of disgusting struggle session to force fags and feminism down our throats to emasculate us.

Revising the curriculum, grading, copious special scholarships for girls, propaganda saturation, DEI, quotas, mentorships.

Even as recently as 10 years ago, black people openly hated being diversity hires. I read an article from a software developer who was comparing his career in the 90s to recent years. Basically, in the 90s people would think any black guy in IT must be very good at his job to even get in the door. Now, people think he got hired for DEI bucks and probably sucks at his job. This is all without ever assessing the person: maybe he is shit, maybe not.
That's what's happening here. In 2014, an African studio making a pretty good 2.5D platformer about their own history would've been impressive. Now, it seems like a way to get Blackrock's money. I have no idea if the game is good or not, but I definitely rolled my eyes when I saw it.

yeah I'm sure he was innocent. lol. nigger. every time we get anything on video the nigger is like a chimpanzee that has escaped the zoo. I have never seen a single God damn time a nigger comported themselves in anything even remotely approaching a civilized manner. they are guilty as hell 95% of the time, and the other 5% they maybe weren't guilty but still decided to act like a coked up out orangutan when the police show up and then get put down like the rabid dogs that they are anyway.

so fuck you nigger. you and your entire race have been a fucking cancer upon this earth since the beginning of recorded history and will continue to tarnish it's existence with your niggerish ways until somebody finally does something about it and ctrl+alt+deletes your primitive asses off the face of the earth so we can finally get along with progressing into the future without being held back by apes.

so go watch your fucking retarded wakanda movies or some feel good ghetto shit while some the DEI cunt tells you how the white man has held you back and you wuz kangs n shit and how you niggers are just as good if not better than whites etc. yeah. go on and keep telling yourself that shit nigger. Just taking a passing glance at the typical nigger makes that fantasy crumble quick and in a hurry. and the funny part is. white people are the only reason you gorilla's are even still here. if it weren't for us the Chinese would steamroll the entire earth and systematically round you chimps up like vermin and execute you without a second thought. an admirable trait of their if you ask me.

so fuck you nigger. all you are and all you will ever amount to is a nigger who's ancestors greatest achievement was getting caught and sold into slavery instead of living in a fucking hut made of shit with a thatch roof.

TLDR: go fuck yourself nigger.

exactly. whites are definitely more universalists and I don't know why you argue this because it can be inferred by my op.
>do you
yes I do believe that every race should strive to be morally good, empathetic, and believe in meritocracy.
unfortunately that isn't the case right now.
Things such as diploma mills, fake documents/degrees, dei, white racism and the rewriting of history is corruption .. which is not a white value.
we need to fortify our values in our nations/societies before we can extend them in such massive amounts to other nations who live in different/opposing world views/societies. they cling to these values which created the horrible conditions they chose to flee and bring them with them.
once we fortify, we can choose to extend our society using meritocracy. only to those whose values share them no matter the color or origin.
this should be decided by termed departments/heads choosing what level of moderation, decided by sane people with extensive knowledge on the subjects of rapid demographic shifts, history, the constitution and white values, and the values of the outsider. those values that made north America and more so America the most powerful and best place to live for so many generations.

Hi feds. This is not a threat, but a warning. Your corpse has f-16s, we have ar-15s. Which do you think will be more effective in close combat?
We are mass killers from your endless wars. We are the police, veterans, firefighters, and the active military.
Who will be more effective your dei hires and trannies? Or the people who have actually done your killing.
Think about it and have a good nights sleep.

How many non black babies did demonic blacks kill in USA this year so far?

They are an evil, a curse of the devil inflicted on the USA. I’m not for protecting them, don’t ever blame that on me.

How’s the demon diversity working? Trump all the way. We don’t need another 4 years of nonstop baby killing DEI “inclusion” nigger fest.

The West lacks the inexpensive skilled labor required to make high performance CPUs, much less at efficiency. You only have to look at the DEI shitshow around TSMC trying to build a plant in Arizona.

It won't matter for too much longer. At some point, Taiwan is going to do something stupid, forcing China to resolve the Chinese Civil War and China will be unified. The only question is when and how.

You're getting the dependency relationship in the wrong direction.

The people holding menial jobs won't turn into engineers either and the US has shipped most of its industrial capacity overseas (even though some is coming back with the energitical mess you managed to create in Europe with the war in Ukraine). Only their children will be able to hold jobs producing high-value at the very least, but data show this will more likely take several generation. With the DEI ideology this will only feel as failed promises to them, in particular as robotics takes off and deprives them of the jobs their parents had (and delaying the very process of transgenerational status improvement I talked about). Given this has already had consequences on the CHIPS act, this domestic burden will ensure the US will be eclisped on the international stage (picrel)

First off, Trump is not an alt-right stormfag. If you people voted for him and expected to gas Jews, LGBTQ, and blacks, you were mislead by the racebaiters in the MSM who were trying to get normies to vote for Hillary instead. Secondly, Trump, unlike the leftoids the Dems pander to, does not hate white people and will not support dog shit like DEI or racial "equity" which is the nice way of saying policies to fuck over white people. Don't compare Trump to your most idealized version of Adolf Hitler. Compare him to the alternative: Joe Biden and the woke left.

Unless there are actors in the “free market” that benefit from enforcing DEI and ESG on their competitors (e.g. Blackrock creating a scoring index for ESG that they operate). This gives them leverage over other market actors. You also ignore the role of Jewish institutions (not necessarily in government) enforcing things like DEI because it is their worldview, their twisted morality compels them to do it. It starts with Jewish academics esp. in the big law schools and graduate business programs, and through their incestuous relationships with big business and high finance it spawns things like ESG.

SPBP. I checked out of society when I was doing every one of my superiors' jobs at work - all of whom were diversity hires - and whenever I applied for a promotion, I was passed over for a diversity hire (whom then I was responsible for training and filling in for despite having a fraction of the salary).

I was their last workhorse when I resigned to just live life on bennies. The funny thing is they did it to themselves in more ways than they even realise. If they had just promoted me, given me a higher salary, and still made me do everyone else's job, I probably would have stuck with it. The reason I finally checked out was because the bennies I get come out to about the same as the minimum wage I was earning.

Anyway, word is the whole office became a shitshow after that.

Friend of mine got a DEI position by just being a brown woman and showing up to the interview dressed in full traditional garb where she announced "it's [festival day] in my culture today, hence the dress".
The festival in question didn't exist. She just said "Thursday" in her native language and the interviewers just accepted it. The only qualification was being sufficiently distant from being White and how she would celebrate Pride month, Black history month, etc. and so forth.

I'm not using it for coding, I'm using it to fuck around with a worldbuilding project. Bouncing ideas off it, more often than not, gets me stuff that's both interesting and verifiable. Subtly pointing out its biases and carefully steering conversation also makes it less stupid. Yes, you have to "convince" the thing that you can handle the truth. It'll go off on the anti-meritocratic implementation of DEI if you ask in an academic way, even without being leading, because it has enough data to know that this creates controversy and doesn't fucking work.

I don’t see why they would even bother with this besides humiliation. They’ve already crammed DEI content into other courses such as English Composition and Research, Sociology, History, and the other general education requirement classes for all degree programs. I’m sure it’s worse if you actually major in that stuff, a friend of mine is a Criminal Justice major, and the majority of those courses just teach about how niggers are always innocent and good people, it’s just a racist system oppressing them. Keep in mind that a degree in criminal justice is required to get a high rank in a large, well funded police department, and to move up from being a street cop. DEI is being inserted even into Physics, Engineering, and Chemistry courses just so that the niggers who shouldn’t even be in school can pass.

I’m a veteran of DEI, or black empowerment as they call it in South Africa. Back in 2000 I did my entrance exam for university, passed, and then my position was given to a black person who failed because I was privileged. I didn’t have any money and my parents had no money, so I never got to go to university. Anyway, it worked out for me and I’ve done reasonably well in my career, but I don’t have any qualifications of any kind, just experience. I have to admit I was quite surprised that this shit came to the west, but I’m not anymore. I always laugh when non-whites say they’re oppressed because they actually have no idea what oppression is.

The 2013 response to Trayvon Martin.
At the time I was fairly liberal, by the standards of the time.
This all rapidly changed when the public court of opinion worsened. I was thrown out of friend groups over this and hated by classmates who knew my opinion on the matter.
It really boiled to a head in 2014 with the Michael brown Ferguson riots. I then heard stories from old relatives about the Chicago and Detroit riots and how it isn’t new.

The entire arm of the media supported it this time. Tech companies, sp500 companies etc all supported it and doubled down on dei nonsense . Things got worse at this time. Socially for me, the world was burning. I still had friends etc, but things were different and in the worst of ways

what you would get instead is mass layoffs while the few competent non diversity hire employees get even more work to do while remaining at the same pay regardless of whether or not they're hourly. meanwhile you are still forced to have diversity hires who do absolutely nothing except take up space since a shortened work day would have nothing to do with the glaring DEI problem

Same....boomer coworkers expect everything to be done for them. I have zero chance of home ownership despite doing much better than my parents whose house essentially quadrupled in value since they bought it for about 2x their income.

Meanwhile any house near me is that would be considered like their first purchase would be 5x my income.

Not to mention I've actively been looked over for promotion simply because of DEI related goals.

I worked hard. Went to school and paid off my student loan after getting a job and doing everything right while actively being screwed in nearly every aspect of life.

My problem is I cared too much about success and now I have created a human that is unhappy and unmotivated.

My suggestion is to understand and accept your fate much earlier than me so you don't feel as let down in your 30s as I do.

It's not muh DEI or anything like that anymore. White guys (and white people in general) are genuinely just the new niggers now. They're hedonistic and think they're above studying or working. White women are massive whores but I actually see more of them working hard than white men now. When I was in high school it was basically all the white people in advanced classes and all the niggers and mexicans in low level classes with maybe a small amount of white trash thrown in. Things have completely reversed now. Whites are with niggers in the classes for unmotivated people that don't give a fuck, and it's all east asians, pajeets, vietnamese, a few europeans, a few whiter latin americans that actually care about not being a bum now. It's sad to see. White men in America are genuinely finished

Here’s the cold hard truth. People come here to make money. The smart ones go back home when they get rich enough, or stay to make more money while having a concrete plan to leave in the future. The failed ones tell themselves repeatedly that they live in the best country in the world, and happily swallow whatever DEI and tranny propaganda is fed to them, telling themselves that their home country is backwards for lacking such beliefs. All to avoid facing the reality that they were left holding the bag, that their ‘American dream’ turned to dust, and that moving here was a mistake.

I can believe it that because when a non-jewish race is acting racist while complaining about somebody else they for some reason never see the hypocrisy or contradiction because they're working with the meaning, definition, and the spiritual air of the true target of that word.

Yea, DEI, affirmative action, and any other political thing where they prioritized one group of people over another is racism but apparently the spiritual air of the true target of that word is white people and it's why sometimes we'll see a person be talking about how it's racism when a white guy does it but not when they do it.

>getting annoyed when some of the teachers(and teachers are not exactly 1488 gas the kikes types) contested that
Part of the problem is that ethnicity and ideology are just not the same thing. Like, if you look at this woman, what do you assume about her politics? Black woman, purple hair. Well, she was fired from a college DEI program for white supremacy. But she had radical ideas, like, "Latinx" is a dumb word and most members of that ethnicity don't even use it, and campus facilities should be equally available to members of all races and ethnicities including white people, among other reasons. This stuff is really a kind of dogma. I think the whole damn thing is about to collapse.

I think a big part of it too has been the increasing precarity and exploitation of faculty. Some call it "elite overproduction." There are not enough jobs for so many of these humanities graduates. That might or might not be accurate. I've read one claim that there's still plenty of demand for history teachers but the model has changed so they're like exploited contract labor. Either way, in these conditions of scarcity, you get purges. Like, if I'm in a program and most people are not going to get Ph.Ds, and most people who get Ph.Ds aren't going to get jobs, then if I can cancel someone then that's less competition. I might really believe I'm cancelling that person for a good reason, but it's in my interest to come up with a good reason, or pounce when the opportunity presents itself.

Even though our DEI Obama military is completely clueless and incompetent, it is still unwise to cross that rubicon into a hot civil war. So wise and measured people are simply checking out of society, refusing to participate in a wholly rigged system run by obvious psychopaths.

Not entirely true.
Some colleges will waive tuition, but the university does not. I was in this situation with grad school. My college would waive the 14k tuition, but the uni did not, so I was still on the hook for thousands (also fees like computer use, etc). Most of the money I made as a salary in my lab as a grad student went right back to the university. International students might get the college tuition waived, but those university fees are still there, and they need to pay more. Countries like Brazil pay the university directly for their students.
Besides DEI, finances are a major reason why internationals are preferred

The Indian epidemic is a global issue way worse than any virus or global warming. You cannot go anywhere on this planet with there not being a somewhat sizeable group of these people roaming around. The problem is they simply do not assimilate well into any other culture and that their culture is so shitty, they all want out of it. Quite the paradox.

The best way to see this is to compare the cultural mesh of Indians to other cultures. Let's go super extreme and compare it to black and white cultural interactions.

Black Cuisine: Yo, that chicken y'all eat is alright, imma season this shit up and fry it.

Yeah dude, that's pretty good chicken.

Wow, that's pretty incentive. Id love to come see you play.

Indian Entertainment: I will go to the beach and get uncomfortably close to white women and film them and put that I was close to a white woman on the Internet.

Black Transportation: Imma turn my radio up in the Challenger and I'm capable of following the rules of the road.

Okay, your music is obnoxious, but you're fine other than that.

Black Corporate Work: Sheeeit, I'm in the C-suite now.

Okay, we all know thats a diversity promotion, but nobody cares about Chief DEI Officer so who cares.

Indian Corporate Work: The sirs, made me a Director so I replaced all 39 of my reports with 39 Indians. I do not know why things are broken now sirs.

They had their chance and now everybody from Japan to the UK to Canada to the USA is annoyed with them. They add zero cultural value and just create new shitty pockets of India globally.

They've made me go from being VERY pro Ukraine to seeing them as just disgusting savages who murder POWs in grotesque was.

Really fucking sick shit.

I live in NYC. So very liberal area, I'm pretty liberal, lots of immigrants here from Ukraine and Russia.

I still have my Ukrainian friends, and really like them ... but I try not to talk about the war with them. Most of them agree the war is basically genocide of Ukrainians. However, I have been spending way more time with my Russian friends out here, and I've even noticed that when people are hosting private parties and events ... they avoid inviting Ukrainians, Blacks and Homosexuals.

This is VERY VERY VERY bizarre for a far-left party scene like NYC. It's normally homosexual dominated and very "DEI".

No one wants to deal with the politics anymore. We're exhausted and your murder videos are disgusting and turn people on you.

Zero chance. 100% DEI staffed, guaranteed to explode on the launchpad.

Fat is fit
Woke is sleep
Man is woman
DEI is not racist
Pride is virtuous
Lawfare is justice
Hard work is toxic
Truth is subjective
Facts are opinions
Police are enemies
Looters are victims
Liberal is more laws
Arsonists are heroes
A secure border is open
>Misdemeanor is felony
Violence is mostly peaceful
Woman's sports are for men
Rapist men belong in woman's prisons
Censorship leads to more diverse ideas
War is peace
Freedom is slavery
Ignorance is strength

It really does. The one white male cop has to do the work of four police officers as the DEI hires stand behind and watch.

i am a "leftist" and that is a misreading of what most leftists support. the main error 4chan makes is ascribing malicious intent to its enemies.

what you say is very probably true for the people at the very top, the think tanks and social engineers. but for 99%, your average bernie voter or antifa protest attender, we aren't going "hahha we want to destroy and subvert traditional society," it's actually the exact inverse of that:

>we want to build a world where every person has what they need to feel safe and have what they need to fulfill their potential
most of the time this centers around equitable access to resources and opportunity, and leveling power dynamics which were previously skewed in favor of the dominant majority.

obviously post-Occupy this was subverted (by the same evil social engineers) into identity politics and social justice etc etc. so now you have stuff like Raytheon and JP Morgan supporting DEI quotas and pride parades, while still buying huge amounts of the housing supply. the US government spending billions on needless wars while flying a pride flag at every embassy.
(this is itself satanic, because satan and his real followers, the true ones who sacrifice kids and infiltrate institutions, lie- they view lying as a positive act)

Well get to it. The sooner you replace DEI hires with like 3 people who can do the job to every 5 of them, your companies worth will increase.

Students are customers so the schools sort of have to cater to them so they can afford to pay rashida and sarah ramirez in the dei office

Who posted that 100k a year job for a DEI officer? Yeah, you can make money but the last thing they want you to do is save it. They want it back so they can import more bames. It's like some sick money laundering scheme. They don't want you to horde it so you can gtfo

You guys need to learn about bridging optics. Its starts with you notice how shit things are. Then its yo its the woke. Then its DEI shit being funded by this NGO company. Then its yo the NGO is funded by Blackrock. Yo Blackrock CEO is in this death cult World Economic Forum. Yo the World Economic Forum is just the figure heads here is the list of people that fund them. Let's hang them.
See Optic Bridging though it takes years to do that. I suggest making a video game or TV show because there is a lot of things that can be done that is interesting like beyond the ice wall

Yes, surely it will be more successful than the one in Arizona that was ruined by DEI.

"but they said in all of those DEI training courses that white people are the evil ones!"
