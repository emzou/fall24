back in the day when you could actually rough niggers up to keep them in line, if they had your badge number they might be able to finger you, but nowadays with DEI and Floyd and bodycoams, etc, the request is mostly meaningless except for trying to rile cops up.

We need more of everything, but to get that you need to arrange things such that people, Canadians, can afford to order and purchase all of that everything, instead of squeezing them.
Government's response is to allocate funds with giant cheques towards organizations whose self-interest is to prolong the problem so they can continue to get funds to alleviate the problem. It doesn't really matter which government you point to, most of Canada is captured in this way.
Trudeau and the federal government is especially bad though. Consultants, contractors, funding announcements, media attention, and gridlock are all the subject of the day. Really it's just expensive.
The main solution to nothing working to make things better so far has been to juice immigration. Start a game of musical chairs that goes faster and faster and faster in hopes that something will happen to suddenly fix the economy.
The secondary solution is to pay for more administration to organize and manage scarce resources. Except the way we end up doing it costs us more of those resources in the first place, as the labour-units that actually produce results get tied up answering and creating supporting paperwork for the new management. And the bureaucracy will never shrink itself autonomously so despite hopes this never gets better either.
The tertiary solution is media and DEI bureaucracy to distract from real problems with a feel-good narrative about identitarian oppression being at the root of one's issues. And implied to be at the root of society's economic issues. This solves nothing either but it keeps the wrong people in charge as they promise to fix things. Heaven forbid anyone else get elected to try something truly different.

How did DEI work for the lowly warehouse workers?

Did managers get promoted from the outside or did they rise up in the ranks?

What was the relationship between managers and worker? I know at UPS all lowly factory workers up to drivers were all union members, while the managers were not. Often the drivers made more than managers and looked down on them. Was there any similar relationship?

Music is the one artistic medium that is virtually immune from corruption for the social engineering aims of psychopaths because it necessarily engages with forms of beauty that are timeless and transcendent. Even the most artistically and spirtually debased forms of music contain fragments of the divine. It's like the Imago Dei in this sense.

That poster isn't exactly wrong. DoD is having a hard time meeting recruitment goals, and it's not getting better. Democrats don't exactly have a "service" mindset, more of a "gimmedat" mindset. So as more whites get kicked out by DEI rules, management becomes more and more "career" minded, shits gonna get real bad and no one is gonna sign up. Especially if Democrats poison the well further with politics from the top down. Plus Democrats will eventually slash the budget that goes to the military for more gimmedats and entitlements.

Well guess what the judge in this case is siding with this and given your history of not supporting DEI and other initiatives we’re getting a court appointed overseer over all your current holdings and investments.
JP Morgan? More like JP Done.

And they’ll make up evidence and facts as well as legal reasons in their up and coming assault on the financial system.

I mean does the decision of this judge make any sense in terms of him making up his own valuation numbers for Mar-A-Lago?

You guys just like Trump think and thought that the law and the legal system is something that will finally stop them and protect you. That assumes that there’s still a tiny bit of salt or a mustard seed of sanity and reasoning left in them. What good is a legal system when people decide together as a group or faction that they’ll just whatever they feel like within the legal circles and decisions like this DA and lawyer.

The Hundred-Horse Chestnut (Italian: Castagno dei Cento Cavalli; Sicilian: Castagnu dî Centu Cavaddi) is the largest and oldest known chestnut tree in the world.[1][2] Located on Linguaglossa road in Sant'Alfio, on the eastern slope of Mount Etna in Sicily[3] — only 8 km (5.0 mi) from the volcano's crater — it is generally believed to be 2,000 to 4,000 years old (4,000 according to botanist Bruno Peyronel from Turin).[4] It is a sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa, family Fagaceae). Guinness World Records has listed it for the record of "Greatest Tree Girth Ever"

That was sort of what I concluded as well.
And this is the thing.
Young people want to start businesses but don't have rich families or connections...what do they do?
I'm not shilling for her or that obviously cookie-cutter-DEI "Business."
But I have just enough experience in microbusiness development to be sickened when I see these capital sponges that are effectively undergrad group business seminar projects to pad people's LinkedIns...which maybe is all they're capable of, I don't know.
But if I were, today, the young person trying to start my business as I was in the early '90s, I'd be shit out of luck. And it makes me mad. The setup for failure for young people, and particularly young white men, and the rare white woman (like my wife) cut out to start companies...it just pisses me off.
This is why I do whatever I can in my own circles to advise young guys, and the occasional gal, on how to start a microbusiness and leverage it early on...so they don't have to whore themselves to the DEI industry. The amount of whoring young entrepreneurs have to do for the piddlingest amounts of money is truly blackpilling.
Thank you for reading my blog post.

I got out of volunteering for publicly funded small business entrepreneurship development programs because of the proto-DEI shit.
It wasn't enough for young people (and some not so young) to have an idea for a business, and the ambition to give it a go, or whatever. Because they didn't have rich relations or connections, they went to these public funding sources...and then were told they had to pay out the ass with white guilt, nigger worship, etc.
And now with the federally engraved-in-stone DEI shit, few young entrepreneurs who lack family or connection funding can get that funding without putting melanin at the center of their business model...and hiring not the best staff but the Crayola box.
I have no idea what did or didn't happen here, but the immediate default to interracial porn suggests something else is in play here. Shilling.

TEDCO is leading innovation to market in Maryland and contributing to a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem in the State through its various programs and funds.

So to get money from them young entrepreneurs have to whore themselves to DEI if they don't have the personal or family connections to get funding otherwise.

Precisely this.
I worked for various companies of the Fucked Company writeup sort in the '90s that would burn through $30m in VC in 18 months, or 20 in 9, or way more in a bit longer.
But nu/pol/ is a bunch of clueless wagies still clamping their mommies' teats in various ways. And with zero understanding of the business world.

A lot of these startups are established as access instruments. Instruments for getting inside various rooms and meetings and conferences where the real money is handed out, first in dribs and drabs, later in bigger amounts. Networking they used to call it.

Also a lot of dribbydrabby funding goes to companies like this one so that the FUNDERS can mouthfart about how they support DEI etc.
Then they get writeoffs of various sorts for telling useless or idiotic or easily led young people how very entrepreneurial and brave and smart etc. they are.
I have no idea what actually happened leading up to her murder, but the fact that the nigger's lawyers are shilling so hard here indicates it must be egregious.
Powerful men will always use the ambitious and possibly visionary young like pawns, stroking them and whispering their ears, rather than giving them solid entrepreneurial advice, and sadly there are always impressionable young who have no idea when they're being flattered into self destruction.
It's a harsh old world out there. And a woman on her own who ever EVER relaxes around niggers is a sad thing.

Is DEI Officially Dead?

For the last few years, it seems that the anti-DEI sentiment has gained traction, and old habits have indeed been hard to break. The Supreme Court’s decision to end Affirmative Action and strip away LGBTQIA+ rights has furthered the DEI-hate train. The critiques of DEI have been escalating; in 2020 President Trump issued a diversity training ban and almost three years later, conservatives are hoping to limit corporate DEI efforts.

The chief diversity officer for Virginia recently stated that “DEI is dead.” Martin D. Brown, who has been serving as chief diversity, opportunity, and inclusion officer for Governor Glenn Youngkin since November 2022 made this bold statement in a speech at Virginia Military Institution. In a statement to The Washington Post Brown asserted “it’s proven that institutions achieve more with a more diverse and inclusive workforce...however, equity has become a tradeoff for excellence.”

So then, what is the future of DEI? When this question was asked to an audience on LinkedIn via a poll, the results garnered some interesting findings. Out of over 500 responses, 40% of respondents felt that the future of DEI is less investments and funding in DEI. Twenty-five percent of respondents indicated that there will be less focus on race and racism in DEI efforts. Nineteen percent of respondents said that what we’re seeing now is the end of DEI as we know it, and 16% felt that DEI would stay the same.

Diversity officers hired in 2020 are losing their jobs, and the ones who remain are mostly white

Diversity, equity and inclusion leaders, who were hired in waves to help companies achieve an ethnically balanced workforce after George Floyd’s murder in 2020, are being phased out, surveys indicate, leaving experts in the field concerned that corporations’ talk of affecting change was just empty words.

DEI roles increased by 55% following demands for broader racial equity and justice after Floyd’s murder, the Society for Human Resource Management reported in 2020. But instead of creating fair opportunities and a comfortable work culture for Black employees, a pair of recent reports indicate, DEI professionals are losing their jobs, as layoffs across the economy have gained momentum.

The attrition rate for DEI roles was 33% at the end of 2022, compared to 21% for non-DEI roles. Amazon, Applebees and Twitter lead the way with DEI layoffs since July 2022, according to Revelio Labs, a New York-based company that uses data to analyze workforce dynamics and trends.

Another survey showed that Black employees represent only 3.8% of chief diversity officers overall, with white people making up 76.1% of the roles. Those of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity make up 7.8% and those of Asian ethnicity make up 7.7%

If a room has 10 people and 9 are black women from the Queensbridge projects in NY, the DEI crowd considers is diverse.

Pretty Simple actually. I'd get rid of fucking illegals, pogrom the jews, return to gold standard, end the fed, and then make it impossible for companies to manufacturer goods in other countries without employing Americans domestically.

The reality, the reason women\men don't have families these days, is almost entirely economical and (((feminism))). Up until 1980 it was normal for a single income to support an entire family. WE signed NAFTA, WTO, and a shit load of other globohomo bills that made it easier for kikes to profit and turn the middle class into a debtot-serf class.

IF you reduce the amount of cheap labor in the US while also forcing domestic production and wages that rise with profits - you'll return to that single income model, women who are smart and understand domestic family life is better for children will marry and breed - roasties who get run through will find they can't actually compete when companies can't spare the salary to hire DEI and Marketing "make work" roles.

Hitler did it in less than two years with one of the worst national economies in modern history.

>My company went all in on DEI hiring the last couple years and it's spiraling down the toilet from incompetence
I don't have a link handy but there's a story out of South Africa where the government mandated that you had to hire a certain percentage of blacks. One thing that happened was that a lot of blacks ended up working for the power company Eskom.

Their power plants burn coal. So you had a lot of black people in charge of procuring coal, and feeding it into boilers.

...none of them understood why you put coal into a furnace. They were literally too dumb to understand that.

One of them had the """bright idea""" to shovel a load of rocks into the furnace. Of course, the power plant kept working. It was hot enough (from the coal) to just melt the rocks into lava and keep working.

This black brain surgeon concluded:
> dem whyte folks, dey be makin us buy dat expensive coal but it ain't needed! sheeeet
...and then proceeded to purchase only gravel and feed it into the power plant's furnace. Eventually, it stopped working, and the entire boiler was destroyed because of the melted slag in it.

This incompetence, combined with rampant corruption, means that every single day - for years now, every day - there have been scheduled power blackouts in South Africa. They actually have an app that tells them, "your power will go off this afternoon at 3PM and will stay off until tomorrow morning at 9AM" - shit like that.

That's our future. That's the future for all of us thanks to the ideology of leftism.

I did homework when I was in school not to get a gay little headpat from some instructor but so that I could practice and learn all the shit I was paying money to get a degree for. Of course it doesn't matter anymore because any tranny or Shaniqua can get hired just by showing up with no technical skills. My company went all in on DEI hiring the last couple years and it's spiraling down the toilet from incompetence right now but that's not really my problem is it?

I actually think the Canadian government is trying a roundabout way to reduce birthrates by poisoning universities.

Birthrate is controlled almost entirely by years of education of women.
1)get rid of white men from universities using DEI. White men will succeed anywhere, and if they are hurt they might group up as a class consciousness.
2) pump university funding hard, then remove it. Allow infinite foreign students as an alternate funding source. This reduces the quality of the education, and makes the white population despise the concept of colleges.
3) let the brown golems attack the white women at the university by removing all support for them, let DEI, foreign sexisn, and racism run rampant against them.
4) make primary schools seem retarded with degenerate sex shit.
5) encourage self training online

The universities are now a stronghold of brown power. Whote people form an underclass, they grow to develop their own class consciousness and a culture of distaste for universities and formal education. This is the exact situation required to increase the birthrate. The brown hordes will also not breed, because they have been too educated. All I'm saying is, if I were a democratically elected leader, and wanted to increase white birth rate knowing the current social environment, this is exactly what you would need to do, to accomplish it stealthily.

No, DEI is incorporated at every level of government, the corporate world, and academia.
The fact that niggers are still failing does not mean they aren't given the most ridiuclous levels of affirmative action ever conceived of, it means they're so fucking retarded that they still can't do things like "apply", in favor of shucking, jiving, and smoking crack.

Kind of. Scott Walker has an ability to read the room in a way other politicians don't, for example, in 2016 he was the first candidate to end his candidacy when it was apparent Trump was winning. He never graduated university, and never went to an Ivy League, so in a way, he was never really considered their equal given he was never degreed and that's always chapped his ass. His economic policies actually gave Wisconsin a budget surplus which Evers hasn't been able to roll back, signed CC laws. He's been very pro business, but much of the DEI and ESG stuff occurred at a higher level of business than he really dealt with.

He's always had ambition for higher office.

They've written articles about it in the outdoors magazines. About the need to be inclusive of all BIPOC in outdoor activities. About the boring "whiteness" of the great outdoors.

Plus you have every single college turning out advertising graduates for 15 years who are brainwashed into believing whitey bad and niggers and BIPOC must be shoehorned into every single thing imaginable.

Then you have Blackrock and their DEI scores, these companies get cheap credit and their stonks purchased if they do things like shitskin up their advertisements.

I’m an outdoor industry insider. Whenever you go to the major industry trade show there’s panels of 35+ year old white women who trail run, climb, or something who complain there’s not enough diversity outdoors. Many of the major players in the outdoor industry are very much concerned with DEI. Patagonia is based in California. Yeti is publicly traded. Dicks sporting goods is publicly traded. Etc. Despite this the outdoor industry is almost entirely white people who live in Colorado, Salt Lake City, or California. They live their perfect Instagram lives with their adventures, dog children, and gas guzzling adventure vehicles, all the while preaching environmentalism and anti-racism.

If you want an idea of the weird deranged mindset these people have read some articles by Wes Siler who wrote pic related. There’s some hilarious stuff in his bibliography.

If we're lucky team PP will take a chainsaw to the administrative burden's outsized share of Canadian GDP. We won't be lucky. In reality any jobs cut like that will be replaced with more traditional or Thatcher-style privatization and the burden will still exist. Canada used to run on nothing but paper and pen. Computers are so much more efficient and yet we have so many more bureaucratic positions deemed critically necessary.
Could PP even get away with a narrowly targeted elimination of DEI positions and tasking which are new since the past decade and have never proven their net benefit? I doubt it.

The authors conclude with this most revealing proposition: ``We need not suppose that appeal to emotion belongs to those who strive in the direction of fascism, while democratic propaganda must limit itself to reason and restraint. If fear and destructiveness are the major emotional sources of fascism, eros belongs mainly to democracy.''

Eros was precisely the weapon that the Frankfurt School and their fellow-travellers employed, over the next 50 years, to create a cultural paradigm shift away from the so-called ``authoritarian'' matrix of man in the living image of God (imago viva Dei), the sanctity of the nuclear family, and the superiority of the republican form of nation-state over all other forms of political organization. They transformed American culture toward an erotic, perverse matrix, associated with the present ``politically correct'' tyranny of tolerance for dehumanizing drug abuse, sexual perversion, and the glorification of violence. For the Marxist/Freudian revolutionaries of the Frankfurt School, the ultimate antidote to the hated Western Judeo-Christian civilization was to tear that civilization down, from the inside, by turning out generations of necrophiliacs.

Daily reminder that pagan LARP threads are a misdirection psyop to distract from CIA use of various different Christian denominations to infiltrate different countries.
Protestant Evangelical pastors, Opus Dei for the Catholics, and of course the Orthodox Church in conformity with Constantinople are all prominent examples of CIA use of Christianity to subvert nations.

But, if you attack Christianity itself, you can't have that conversation about what uncompromised Christian denominations look like.
Now you have anons defending Christianity against Pagan LARP feds.

In real life, the only pagans out there are cringe leftists, nerds, and unstable right wingers.

I worked at a company where a male CEO moved on to be the BoD chairman after successfully running the business for several years. Saw record profits, saw our stock price multiple 12x from its IPO under his leadership, things were great.

His replacement was a female C-Suite exec. As soon as she took office metrics for company satisfaction instantly plummeted. Our stock price plummeted. Our revenue plummeted. She stocked the C-Suite with women. She tried her hand at being funny on one of our town hall meetings and instead came off insulting to the point where the VP, Britain resigned. She tried again and insulted blacks to the point where my team of 9 people--3 out of the 4 blacks resigned. Everyone missed their annual bonuses and faulted her for it. It was such an utter failure that she was on a company town hall literally in tears crying about how hard of a job this was and how she "tried". She would end up resigning a month later.

Her replacement was a season tech industry vet. He came in and pushed out all of the women in the C-Suite. It's all males--and one female now (CMO, not DEI surprisingly). Stock is gently rebounding; satisfaction is back up. Women are just not resilient enough, committed enough, detached from emotions enough, to hold such positions of importance.

My wife and I share the same thought; that there is peace and comfort for her in not having to have to make big decisions. That I can make those decisions in a place of leadership in our home while she maintains the supporting role and she can still receive fulfillment. This "Dick-Envy" women are vying for is pathetic. Go back home. Make a family. Leave the rest to us.

Just say you are jewish, simple as. I have been using this trick for years now, when they make me take a "DEI" seminar I say I am jewish and watch everyone tremble in my presence. I have accused so many people of antisemitism it is unreal, and it works, it REALLY works. Someone will say something like, fuck christianity and the bible. And I will say: Why don't you just say you hate all the jews and get it out of your system! They then say: I was talking about the bible not the jews. I reply with: 70% of the bible is the Torah, which is the jewish bible. They then begin vigorously apologizing to me. When they say that I am a privileged white cis male, I bring up the holocaust and watch them all sink into the floor and look away. These tricks really work anon, I have fucked over my co-workers so hard by larping as a jew. IT IS FUCKING GLORIOUS! I have been promoted twice in the last 2 years, and everyone is afraid to say ANYTHING to me. They have made special exemptions for me personally because I am jewish, I do not have to take DEI workshops anymore, and I get first pick for any new positions opening up. These tricks can work for you too anons, just say you are jewish, buy a 3 dollar yarmulke and add a few jewish words to your vocabulary and BAM!, you are jewish. The best part is that no one can force you to prove you are jewish because you can just bring up the holocaust and talk about the "yellow star". Leftists are utterly hopeless against these tricks, they are bound in their dogma so strongly that they will deny the evidence of their own eyes and ears. Anyway, good luck anons, I wish you all the luck in the world with implementing these tactics for your personal gain!

Target was explicitly targeted (ahem) from the start of BLM because they had always donated to a generic and inoffensive police-rekated charity.

After this happened they Groveland at the feet of BLM, signed up 100% for DEI globohomo faggotry, and appointed a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and of course they went so woke that it culminated in the satanic designer deal, the tranny bathing suits for children, and the boycott which cost $10 billion in share value in the first month alone.

Googler here. This story makes me fucking furious.

For those who don't know: Timnit Gebru is a top researcher in AI ethics. Sounds like a smart person, right? She did a good job highlighting poor performance of facial recognition systems on black people -- that paper's been cited ~1000 times. Not bad.

So here's what happened lately:
>October: she writes a paper, skips the normal review process to submit to a conference
>November: full Google reviewers take a look and say "wtf this isn't publication quality"
>December: she freaks out and demands to know everyone who was consulted in the process of reviewing the paper.
>Refuses to retract the paper, threatens to resign
>Sends an incoherent email to an AI mailing list with hundreds of employees on it saying "stop working on DEI and fairness projects leadership doesn't care"
>Is *shocked* when they're like "OK if you hate it that much we're accepting your resignation".

The email alone is grounds for revoking your role as a manager or termination. This isn't all she's been doing though:

>She literally had been threatening to sue Google with a team of "feminist lawyers" (her words), then she was shocked when they responded to her ultimatum about resigning with an Attorney-Client Privileged document. Of fucking course they did , you're literally threatening legal action
>She's the same person who drove Yann LeCun (a fucking Turing award winner) off Twitter with her retarded "it's not my job to educate you" stance

Because I'm internal I've read the paper she's been whining about and it's utter trash. Literally her argument is "GPT-3 (and similar large models) are bad because big models require compute costs to produce and that's bad for the environment" AND "GPT-3 is bad because it encodes modern society and modern society is racist". Her recommendation seems to be "stop doing anything until society isn't racist".

Jeff Dean is a fucking great man and I have been completely seething watching this whole exchange.

White people just need to accept being replaced, they've had their time. White is a flaw, and characters in stories and movies who were white must be corrected with "minorities" (even as whites become literal monitories). White bad.

Exactly. Particularly the part near the end of the video, you can almost get a sense of how much the whites are enjoy playing their roles of over-the-top caricatures of what they think are white conservatives. They live in a strange world in their minds, which unfortunately Hollywood and what-not love to entertain.

the beauty of the usury system is the only way it can fail is if they want it to fail. they can print endlessly. stack more debt. it only begs the question of when will they call in the debt. that we know, is sometime between now and 2240. if they wanted to, they could fix the prices of and all products/commodities overnight. this its gonna fail in two more weeks is a fever dream. it isnt gonna happen anytime soon at all. theres too many people working, with roofs over their heads, who have disposable income to buy guns and ammunition. they need dei, npnw, and other tricks to try to put those people into the pit, so they cant be of risk to jews when they do collapse it. evacuating the jews is another tell. do you see a mass exodus of jews fleeing from your country? then nothings coming. the second that happens is when youll know. and by that point itll be late. just like the ukranians left trapped to fight their war, so too will all europeans be left trapped to fight the horde as we all scramble for food and water.

if you this is inevitable, it is in our to interest to begin this war on our own terms, rather than theirs. the longer we wait, the more people will needlessly have to die.

Gets off the phone with his African nigger girlfriend and an hour later is telling me the state we live in is "sheltered" while simultaneously complaining that people are complacent and uses BLM as an example because they burned everything down and people did nothing about it. Tells me he has to go to Chicago for work and openly trashes any predominantly black city as we walk down the street. Doesn't know if the nigger who makes pizza is just "slow" or "is just like that because he's from Chicago". Assumes that anyone or anything political is inherently right wing and so is the media even though we live under left wing ideology. Scared of his downstairs neighbors "Trump 2024" flag while trannies walk the streets below his metro apartment. Doesn't notice half the white women in his complex hang out at the pool all day with niggers. Gets his hair cut at the barbershop with fag flags out front. Zips around on some e-scooter passed homeless & immigrants all day, doesn't care because he can see the professional baseball field across the street from his high rise.

John Dee was an esteemed 16th-century English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, counselor to Queen Elizabeth I and Enochian magician who is best-known for designing his seal, "Sigillvm Dei Aemeth". It has long been associated with him.
Sigillum Dei Meth is associated with Enochian magic and thought to symbolize God's truth - "meth" being a translation from Hebrew for "truth". It consists of many God and angel names, geometric forms, and mysterious symbols arranged into an intricate pattern that could serve as both protective talisman or tool to summon angels or celestial entities.
John Dee's Enochian system is vast and varied; his teachings on this topic contain deep symbolic and spiritual levels of meaning; modern interpretations can vary dramatically between practitioners and researchers, providing diverging opinions as to its use and significance. The Sigillum Dei meth is only one component.

Eros was precisely the weapon that the Frankfurt School and their fellow-travellers employed, over the next 50 years, to create a cultural paradigm shift away from the so-called ``authoritarian'' matrix of man in the living image of God (imago viva Dei), the sanctity of the nuclear family, and the superiority of the republican form of nation-state over all other forms of political organization. They transformed American culture toward an erotic, perverse matrix, associated with the present ``politically correct'' tyranny of tolerance for dehumanizing drug abuse, sexual perversion, and the glorification of violence. For the Marxist/Freudian revolutionaries of the Frankfurt School, the ultimate antidote to the hated Western Judeo-Christian civilization was to tear that civilization down, from the inside, by turning out generations of necrophiliacs.

If this statement seems harsh, consider the following. In his 1948 work on The Philosophy of Modern Music, Frankfurt School leader Theodor Adorno argued that the purpose of modern music is to literally drive the listener insane. He justified this by asserting that modern society was a hotbed of evil, authoritarianism, and potential fascism, and that, only by first destroying civilization, through the spread of all forms of cultural pessimism and perversity, could liberation occur. On the role of modern music, he wrote, ``It is not that schizophrenia is directly expressed therein; but the music imprints upon itself an attitude similar to that of the mentally ill. The individual brings about his own disintegration.... He imagines the fulfillment of the promise through magic, but nonetheless within the realm of immediate actuality.... Its concern is to dominate schizophrenic traits through the aesthetic consciousness. In so doing, it would hope to vindicate insanity as true health.'' Necrophilia, he added, is the ultimate expression of ``true health'' in this sick society.

The system is absolutely fucked in America, I and two other students applied to ivies and top unis back in 2020, had high Swedish high school GPA and research experience, the two other students were much better performing than me and had a lot more valuable academic and extracurricular whatnot from playing tennis and doing extensive research with professors at those schools in biomed related stuff. None of us got in but some wokie Jew at another school in Stockholm got into Princeton and she wasn't even near well performing (16/20.0 on Swedish GPA without extra merits), you may question why? Because she participated with a bunch of BLM non-profit activities in Sweden amid the Great Floyd chimpout and created some shit-tier DEI activism clubs. I think this is a good wake up call that emphasis on actual academic potential is no longer the case in America where the system is Jewed to the core. I'm however doing my engineering in Sweden now.

It would render internal DEI and HR no longer a worthwhile expense since there’s no longer a looming threat of lawsuits. That wouldn’t make woke marketing end immediately, but it would end the escalation and even allow for the reversal of wokeness.

But it’s understandable that you’d find that implausible since from what I can tell here on 4chan and elsewhere, people begin with the assumption that businesses get their interests 100% of the time and therefore anything that’s happening now is happening because it’s good for businesses. But actually businesses don’t get their way 100% of the time.

>>442244271
The thing is, wokeness is actually not in business interests. That’s why businesses were never actively pushing for civil rights lawsuits through history, nor were they all in favor of shoplifting being tolerated. It was socialists forcing them on businesses with the threat of the state (read: the military)

The true Germanic warrior wants war with the WORLD. Because war is what we do best. You are too mixed out to know that spirit it is lost on you. War is our strength, which is why they do everything to never go to war with western Europeans. We are worth a thousand of their men.

Also >>442211741 that is fucking great, in full it reads;

14 vos enim imitatores facti estis fratres ecclesiarum Dei quae sunt in Iudaea in Christo Iesu quia eadem passi estis et vos a contribulibus vestris sicut et ipsi a Iudaeis
15 qui et Dominum occiderunt Iesum et prophetas et nos persecuti sunt et Deo non placent et omnibus hominibus adversantur

Or in the almost as superior language of English;

14 For you have become imitators, brothers of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you also suffered the same from your fellow citizens as they did from the Jews
15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and persecuted us and do not please God and oppose all men

It speaks of the heretic and in turn warns us of creatures like the Orthodox cult, they actually teach their children that the Church broke away from them, and if their children ever find out about the Old Belivers and the purge they held of them when they re-wrote their entire religion they just pretend it didn't happen. And yet women like Agafia remain.

Read about the Old Believers. The OG heretics. Then the new orthodox invention is a Golem of their Jewish overlords like Vatican 2 is, but earlier, and more Jewish. Both must be overthrown and the Orthoheretics must return to the only church that Jesus Christ formed with his own two hands as outlined in Timothy.

Horizontal integration means that the enemies of the working man are everywhere, and all power under monopoly-capital has more unity with itself than its clients. For example, unions are an employment program for the middle class, so it is an act of patronage and self-preservation for the middle class in government to grant special bargaining power to unions - this means a negotiating worker has to pay into those union sinecures in order to play bargaining. Similarly with corpos needing HR departments, inspectors, etc. - federal and judicial processes simply work "smoother" for a business that's offering sinecures to the middle. This relationship is client-patron within the middle class. Same with DEI officers. The point is that if you're a business, your relationship to power is smoothed over if you're keeping sons and daughters in easy, high-status work.

Much of dialectic politics is correctly identified as a procession of opportunistic top-bottom alliances to resolve the contradictions of the era. For this reason, keep an eye out for top-bottom synthesis which identifies the need to substantially reduce middling bloat. Cutting out the overhead skimmed by the professional-managerial class (in exchange for net-negative organizational return on their "brainwork") and allowing it to suffuse back over small/mid business and workers would be sufficient to kickstart another American golden age.

Guibert was a Benedictine historian from Medieval times and is attributed to “inserting” into the account of the First Crusade anti-Jewish rhetoric.
Guibert personally knew crusaders, had grown up with crusaders, and had talked with them about their memories and experiences on their return.

But you, Amerimutt, your numbers are actually dwindling. Your country is freefalling into debt, your borders are wide open, your women are miscegenous whores, your government is of foreign bodies and foreign interests, and you're quickly turning into a hated minority in your own country where people have legal permission to discriminate against you (diversity/DEI).

But congrats, you dropped some bombs and killed lots of brown and gooks for the cost of trillions of added debt. You represent the America that deserves to fail.

So-called "Whiteshift" is an inevitable reality so they basically are already becoming White. IMO 75% Euro is a reasonable threshold.

Odd that /pol/ gatekeeps Whiteness so much when it's WHITE LIBERALS that are chiefly responsible for the degeneracy of other races in this country. White liberals are why black people vote Democrat, White liberals are why we have an open border. White liberals are why we've abandoned meritocracy for DEI. White liberals are why we're teaching buttsex for LGTBQLMNOP reasons in elementary school.

Whites need to tell Latino Americans - "Embrace the European within".

The government knows that years spent in education causes low birthrates. They can't fix the issue through direct action because it's a democracy and they made the mistake of giving women the vote. They know that universities love foreign students, because they charge them 5x more than domestic students.

The government then makes immigration hard, but opens the floodgates on allowing foreign students to enter. Western states steal the peak foreign students, displace domestic white men and women, accelerate and hide the intent through DEI programs. Without college education, white women have more kids. China and India have their collapse accelerated by stealing their beat youth, who will not breed once here due to education. At the same time, they introduce psyops to make the white population disparage colleges and introduce a subtle current of racial favoritism and startup parallel society culture in whites.

It's actually a pretty ingenious setup. Once I realized the plan it gave me more respect for the American intelligence agencies and shadow government. It's very subtle.

Rather than rally against it, the best option would be to support DEI programs against white women at colleges, and support crafting white male parallel guilds that will replace higher education, who have an esoteric and bizarre culture that discourages women and foreign people from entering. Like have a ritualistic dance you do outside where to smack sticks together to make a loud noise right in front of each other's face for 5 minutes in a circle while maintaining hard eye contact.

Criteria for best place to live:

-minimal anti-white propaganda perpetuated by local/state government
-population not exceedingly elderly (average age below 50)
-minimal niggers
-minimal pajeets
-some mexicans OK
-asians OK
-relatively low crime
-not depressingly rural with nothing to do (i.e. corn fields in Iowa or some shit)
-decent job potential for degree holders without DEI req's
-decent houses available in short proximity to the city around $300k
-not horrendously susceptible to natural disasters, preferably no prolonged snow on the ground that requires heavy road salt (this makes it tricky).

Is it a commitment, or a goal? I don't expect to understand what people talk about with their neetbux and such. So I don't know how it'll play out currently. I've been NEET for over a decade. Got my nice house and enough investments so I'll never have to worry, and then some, but not much more. But it was very hard, coming from nothing and with affirmative action working against me the whole way. When I went NEET I could sense I wasn't going to live much longer keeping at it at that rate, always outworking everyone around me to fight against the DEI score. If I had taken on all the extra work needed to have a woman in tow I'd be dead before ever getting to NEET.

Go ahead and call me a loser. I know I got ripped off. They played me good. I can see a lot of men dying younger in the future who attempt to work within the system. At least the system will skim the taxes from them and never need to pay for their old age. How long is that contract going to hold up? The contract is in question already.

Use their own words and ridiculous logic against them. Calmly explain to them that:
1.) Your bar is a "safe space" for gays who love leather and muscles.
2.) By asking you to change the ways and design of the bar they're forcing change upon—which is not unlike asking them to change themselves to be more inclusive to you.

Granted, I have no idea what the air is like within the highly fractured LGBT "community", but the aforementioned seems like good ammo against anyone with this new-age woke / DEI mindset. Good luck.

There will probably never be a draft, it would be the dumbest possible thing the feds could do, beyond the stupidity of anything ever seen before. Times are hard for the military, but I don't think they'd go for the suicide option that drafting would be.
During Vietnam the Americans lost an officer a week to fragging, and at the fragging peak in 1973 (I think) they were losing an officer a day. Grunts and negroid cattle can easily be replaced, but officers, especially officers that are loyal and willing and able to be serving at the front line are a rare commodity even without a daily chance of friendly-fire murder.
And these were draftees from a past America that still had hope and relative competency. No blm, no social media, no forced troonism and DEI mindfuckery, trans kids, etc. turning everyone with pattern recognition into a volatile terrorist in waiting. Can you IMAGINE being the fed-loving enlistee officer put in charge of a group of draftees made out of today's 20-30 year olds? An they always draft the poor first so he'll be in there with Lemurius Togoomafoo Jefferson an' his reel street niggaz, they'll shoot him on principle.

It's rather difficult hosting a site these days if it gains popularity.

So you need to set up with a "bulletproof" host in a 3rd world nation or on an onion or i2p and still hope that you don't get DNS blackholed. Not exactly cheap for a site that gets a decent amount of traffic, and a lot of work to maintain because everyone is going to be trying to take you down

Actually after doing the research I have a great conspiracy theory about this in regards to things like DEI and canada importing infinite Indian students. I think that governments know that they need to stop education, and they are absolutely stuck because it's a democracy and the women will vote against it. I think what they are doing is working around the problem by clogging the universities up with foreign students. If the problem is that people want to go to college because they need the degrees, fill up every available space in colleges with foreign people that abuse women. Colleges will do it because they can charge 5 times the cost to foreign students, they won't blink at filling up with Indians. But this, coupled with driving white men out with DEI, means that women will eventually find themselves in a place with low quality guys that are constantly accosting them, which is unlikely to accept them in the first place.

Once I realized it was a way to poison colleges it actually increased my respect for the government. If it's a real action they are taking, it's a 300 IQ maneuver.

A common misconception is that women back in the 18-19th century had no rights. The only thing keeping women in the kitchen and out of the ballot box was their complete inability to contribute to society outside of childbirth and low-value work that could just as easily be done by children.

If you try and grind down women unnecessarily you end up being like one of these middle eastern shitholes. Remove the nanny state and DEI shit (both exist primarily to the benefit of grown women) and society will more resemble the natural order.

L'ho scritto sopra in quei 7 punti. Stabilisci un codice di condotta e una serie di requisiti. Inoltre, chi si unisce a te deve avere dei benefit di qualche tipo. Alcuni esempi: aiuto per gli studi, babysitting gratuito, protezione dai malintenzionati...
In tutto questo ci deve essere una continua propaganda patriottica e chi non è fedele alla linea deve venire estromesso.
Non bisogna chiedere di sostenere un certo partito. L'importante è che i comportamenti cambino, che si sviluppi il cameratismo tra gente che prima non si conosceva.

They thrive off attention just like the do nothing wiggers that serve them. If you wanted an antisemitic movement to actually exist it would consist of professionals taking legal action to enforce ESG and DEI mandates onto positions held under jewish nepotism and corruption. Then it would field candidates with more than enough skills and connections to occupy those positions.

Then it would do things like take the ADL to court which Musk may attempt if it's not purely just more theater for the masses before he capitulates and strikes his own deal with them. That's what a real movement to seek resolution looks like. Making jews have to live with the limits they want to put on others. While doing it with exceptional people, no violence needed as they thrive on violence and propagate it constantly to scream victim.

What we have instead of a movement of wiggers who are the best goys of all. They serve global jewry as the lowest pawns and think they're knights. They're all scum and would have been put to death as mentally challenged inferiors under Natsoc.

This. Basically stop being afraid to be a nation who A) has an official people and B) values those people. This is what no western nation has anymore, none of our governments value their people anymore. In fact, it's worse, like my point A: they believe it to be virtuous to not even have a people, because Jewish globalism dictates that suddenly everyone can be French, Swedish, German, America, Canadian, etc. In other words, it doesn't mean shit to be us anymore, we're entirely replaceable in the eyes of our government and elite ruling class. If we as a people decline? Oh well, they don't care, they'll import millions of Africans, spics, whatever, to replace you.
>People are people
Is how they rationalize it. But it's veiled virtue. It's really just a means to control and replace us. Just like DEI, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion has fuck-off to do about actual equity or diversity, but it's simply about changing the ruling and elite class from its perceived "white" status to non-white.

Our previous generations, be they Greatest Gen, Boomers, Xers, etc., completely failed and drop the ball. They invited in trojan horses.

It isn't too shocking, DEI only became common because our Supreme Court made a bunch of bullshit decisions forcing companies to virtue signal.
Now that the Supreme Court has started walking Affirmative Action policies back, companies are taking notice. Harvard already lost a case over AA, Yale had to settle, and Google didn't want to be next.

Unions are bankrolled by Blackrock and Vanguard, which are in turn run by jews. These two companies are behind ESG and DEI, which are inherently anti-White and pro-Bolshevik.

That's specifically why I said you should FORM YOUR OWN UNION. Did you hear that? I'm not against unions as a concept, but rather I'm against the unions that currently exist because they are controlled by Blackrock and Vanguard. I will say it again, and if you don't hear me and still think I'm a jew, then it's clear you are a shill. FORM YOUR OWN UNION.

All because after Kardashians step dad murdered someone and then they said his dress was cute.

Checked. Yeah it’s pretty bad. “Officially” people will of course say all kinds of things. However, it gets to a point it’s undeniable. Globohomo is on a bloodlust to make America seem friendly and pro-African, pro-Indian now for the international geopolitical competition. They will take lower qualified minorities and women for positions all day over White dudes, because the “diversity %” they have at their place of business often determines access to capital markets or government grants.
For example, all of those PPP loans that were doled put during COVID came with pretty extreme DEI requirements for the employers in question.
If you were faced with a choice of your business needing to close, or accepting the loans and quietly hiring as few White dudes as humanly possible, what do you think most chose?

Starfield is a video game, but also a prime example of the coming competency crisis. The video game industry these days attracts the very same type of people who cannot run a water treatment plant, or a hospital, or keep trains from derailing. They cannot model an actual human being, and instead come up with these grotesque potato people models that demonstrate their own complete lack of skill, creativity, or artistry. Yet they are put in charge of a $500 million dollar project, because they check certain DEI tickboxes.

If you larp as a trannie and wear a dress, what bathroom do you use? My autism prevents me from using stall bathrooms anyways as I can't stand the idea of someone being in that sort of space with me so single occupant would be my plan (and they are common enough).

This is how bad the tech job market is. I was investigating a local workplace and discovered their IT director was a trannie so figured it's worth a shot.

Jewmaxxing aka Kikemaxxing, the jewpill, kikepill?Just say you are jewish, simple as. I have been using this trick for years now, when they make me take a "DEI" seminar I say I am jewish and watch everyone tremble in my presence. I have accused so many people of antisemitism it is unreal, and it works, it REALLY works. Someone will say something like, fuck christianity and the bible. And I will say: Why don't you just say you hate all the jews and get it out of your system! They then say: I was talking about the bible not the jews. I reply with: 70% of the bible is the Torah, which is the jewish bible. They then begin vigorously apologizing to me. When they say that I am a privileged white cis male, I bring up the holocaust and watch them all sink into the floor and look away. These tricks really work anon, I have fucked over my co-workers so hard by larping as a jew. IT IS FUCKING GLORIOUS! I have been promoted twice in the last 2 years, and everyone is afraid to say ANYTHING to me. They have made special exemptions for me personally because I am jewish, I do not have to take DEI workshops anymore, and I get first pick for any new positions opening up. These tricks can work for you too anons, just say you are jewish, buy a 3 dollar yarmulke and add a few jewish words to your vocabulary and BAM!, you are jewish. The best part is that no one can force you to prove you are jewish because you can just bring up the holocaust and talk about the "yellow star". Leftists are utterly hopeless against these tricks, they are bound in their dogma so strongly that they will deny the evidence of their own eyes and ears. Anyway, good luck anons, I wish you all the luck in the world with implementing these tactics for your personal gain!

I refuse to believe that anon, christianity doesn't give power to jews, it takes it from them. Sure the israelites are being mentioned, but these kikes nowadays are not the israelites

They only made christian evangelicals believe their bullshit, lutherans fucking hate kikes. Orthodox hate kikes. I'm pretty sure if i'd poke around in some evangelical circles, i'd find a few who hate them as well

It is Opus Dei that gave them power. That gave power to Zionism.

But if what you're saying is correct, then christianity needs a reform. And no, not in a kiked way and introduce LGBTQ shit

A reform Arius tried to establish in the first council of nicaea. We muslims, we actually need christians, the romans. Our prophecy is that we team up, become allies and strike the yahud.

That will also be the time when Gabriel blows into his horn.

They're stubborn, but not smart. Creative, but not intelligent. I saw how fragile, how weak these people actually are and am still wondering what made them rise to power? Opus Dei?

Because he was a moonie, the unification church is in close contact with Opus Dei, and Opus Dei supported Zionism. So in hindsight, Shinzo Abe was a zionist, whether he knew it or not.

Opus Dei is the christian equivalent, Unification church or rather the Moon-Movement is prevalent in Asia and FETÖ in Turkey and Central Asia is the islamic equivalent

Though none of these three have any solid religious base, they're tools for Zionism.

After several generations of locusts and deeply imbedded white guilt, yes the expectation is for everyone (but not them) to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. The same generations who tell tales of 3 generations of a family all living in the same house. The house that was gifted to one of them who either let it get so run down it's now an empty lot, or they double reverse mortgaged it and now it's a Blackrock property.
The same generations using and abusing social programs to pad their retirements or just outright quit working. The same generations that openly drank while driving, now want the surveillance state up your ass at all times. The same generations that used nepotism to carve out a living, now will let their children go into debt with only high school tier jobs left to choose from while they DEI/EEO decent positions to unqualified BIPOCs or foreigners here at home or abroad.

>How can a company consistently bleeding billions trade at over $10 a share? The answer might lie in Ramaswamy's implementation of Roivant's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative, called Roivant Social Ventures, during his CEO tenure. Launched in 2020 while Ramaswamy was still CEO, this initiative aimed to foster "DEI opportunities for future leaders in biopharma and biotech."
So he implemented the policies that he now is against? I thought he said that the policies were implemented after the left his companies?

>Serving as Donald Trump's political fullback and hiding unflattering information from voters may not be a crime, but it is part of a disturbing pattern with Ramaswamy, which goes something like this: Generate media buzz, pull out right before the crash, and leave a rubble behind for others to clean up.

Of course you're going to get dismissed as a shill, you are one. You spent a paragraph making noises about the competency crisis but making zero points about it and noticeably not discussing how it's all caused by DEI and anti-racist insanity. Then we get treated to several paragraphs about how we have to support Washington DC's disastrous proxy war in Ukraine even though it's obvious that it's just about the Beltway's lust for power and wealth, with your only attempt at a point being the tired canard about Ukraine being a "White" nation allegedly being attacked by swarthy Asiatic Russians and that's why it's worth defending. Nobody gives a shit about Jewish owned and run Ukraine. We all can't wait to watch Washington fail here. If those Ukrainians want to quit dying they should quit listening to the backstabbing Jews and Anglos in America's government who are going to leave them out to dry and negotiate a peace with their Slavic cousins on the other side of the line. It's the only hope any of them have left. As for us here in the States, only once the Federal government completely and totally fails can any of us be free.

The West got this asinine Jew idea that men somehow can't protect women and their rights, so women need equal representation everywhere. Thus our religious cult-like obsession with DEI, where everything has to be as inclusive and equally representative as possible. Men have actually done a pretty darn good job at protecting women throughout much of history. It's basically one of our primary purposes, biologically and socially. (Surprise-surprise, with the rise of Feminism and erosion traditional gender roles, there's a glut of young men dropping out of society.)

Men provide women with society and women provide men with purpose of society. But now we're told that it's not our society and that every spic, nigger, muslim, and pajeet is entitled to a slice of it.

I fully expect Biden to ratchet up the promises of student forgiveness until approximately November 10th 2024, then it’ll be forgotten about again for another 4 years. You know, like codifying Roe. They literally had 50 years to actually do something about that, many of those years with a supermajority, yet they still chose to run out the clock rather than actually give you what you want. Dems are just a racket to give the people who would’ve been phds with Starbucks jobs 10 years ago cushy DEI commissar jobs enforcing progressive social propaganda.
