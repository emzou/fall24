I run CNC machines now, the boomers all got to run one machine back in the 80s and got paid fifty bucks an hour back then. Millennials are lucky to get thirty five an hour to run five machines and 10x as many parts, and they have a greater depth of programming and QC knowledge then any 80s boomer machinist ever needed to know.

latinos are going to continue to bleed through to the republican party.
and the left is going to have to pander to them even harder..... along with letting in more millions of people through the southern border illegally who have no attachment to the country but will dive right into the divisie/racialized politics of the left.

More cheap labor, along with more foreign students coming into our universities. So ya all kinds of black/hispanic/white jobs will be lost. Pic very related.
but there is a more off putting aspect to this globalism.
You have seen and heard the resentment from the foreign minister Jaishankar. The posts here don't help, but the history of colonialism is still fresh in the minds many people around the world, but that resentment can be dissipated if they see someone who looks like them in positions of power here in our country, particularly if said person follows the DEI ideology, which is an anti-white, anti-meritocratic and a resentful ideology. For the globalists who see the global south rising and a future market this is their way into said markets, but at the expense of who, and the expense of the native populations of their countries, which happen to be primarily white.

The Left promises to tax the rich and address inequality. But, if they win, they'll only open the borders further and dump more money into DEI.
The Right promises to crack down on illegal immigration and DEI. But, if they win, they'll only lower taxes on the rich and saber rattle against Iran, or China, or whoever else the likes hate this week.
There's no winning. The left won't lower the corporate tax rate, the right won't deport illegals, and there is literally zero connection between public opinion and the laws congress passes.

Remove the old school film reel overlay and just show the clips in the clearest video quality you can get them in. I recommend starting the video off with the Bill Maher clip as he's more well known among normies and build up from there. Using clips of well known celebrities or talking heads saying the quiet part out loud will resonate better with the audience you're trying to reach. If you're planning to do a series maybe try to stick with one topic per video. Mass immigration, DEI programs, the holocaust, slavery, communism, etc. The short video format is a great idea and using the ultimate shabbos goy as the narrator is just marvelously ironic. Keep it up.

Most generously as I can be, the Obama family believes itself to have brought some fundamental morality to the nation through Barack's presidency. You can interpret that in any vague way you want similar to his 'hope' slogan.
As someone who's been paying attention a little bit, I would say she believes in the DEI and associated interpretations of Civil Rights that Obama started and the democrat party now perpetuates. Among that would be valuing and cherishing blacks no matter what. Always listening and being a good ally, etc.
Now read her statement again remembering that democrats have a sort of cult around 'woke' shit and most of those people really like the Obamas.

It's so funny that the choice of Kamala as DEI VP is going to end up fucking Democrats over. If Biden steps down all of the current Biden/Harris 2024 campaign money can only be used by her and choosing someone else would massively alienate the black community that Democrats rely on. They also understand that running Kamala is equivalent to handing Trump a landslide win.

They can't win because of their 2020 VP pick.

>It feels like we're done, but what happened? I've hard covid was actually done to mask the economic collapse and prolong it somehow?
The bankers destroyed the currency it'll take you a couple hours of looking at fed charts to understand.

First the dollar was backed by gold then they cooked the books and change the rules in 1971 ending the gold backing.
Then they ran up a national debt as they were lowering Fed rates from late 1970s until 2019.

So now the debt is 35 trillion with 200+ trillion unpaid liability
This would be okay if they could.have rates under 1% but eventually inflation happens with this much monetary expansion.
So they raise rates with this massive debt causing the interest on the debt to be more than military spending.

If rates are kept at 5% the interest on the debt will outpace taxes by 2030 and that's not counting any government expenses like military social security medical or government jobs lmao.

So things are completely fucked as all the debt gets reissued at 5%

I feel like they do this intentionally but idk
DEI ESG exasperated it all
BRIICS has had enough and is abandoning it

And good luck fighting BRIICS when your own debt payments outpace the entire military spending.

Basically its going to be a collapse and restructure.

The covid collapse was in 2019 the repo markets failed
Those are interbank lending markets.
There was a secret bail out from September 2010 to March 15 2020 then we were all locked down
The bail outs started at 50b a night and ended with 1.5 trillion a night.

The lockdowns killed monetary velocity which allowed massive printing without inflation until everything reopened.

The people in power are fucking cruel assholes who will lie about everything to kick the can.

Also means they can't put Big Mike in unless they get rid of Kamala because two sheboons(even if one is a tranny andnone is a larper) ain't winning an election in the US. The bump in the nigger vote would be offset by spics and asians voting against it. The DNC civil war is funny to watch. They DEI'd themselves into a pickle. And if they put another white person as the candidate, they know they'll get historically low nigger turnout. They could possibly go with a nigger/spic ticket but I have a feeling that would lead to massive white turnout with about a 60/40 overall split for Trump and that would be a complete blowout. Tsk tsk, their best option is to stick with potato joe, concede the Presidency but take the house, add another seat or two in the Senate and obstruct like hell.

poisons are just practice for the REAL ideas

Some things just need to be shortened like an explanation of what is and isn't schizophrenia in a world with technologies that are ridiculously versatile

you start to NEED real PROOFS as in math plus confidence intervals just to not get caught out by a local scam the gov could be pulling just because it NEEDS order

people need social proofs of the big number math on what to put a stop to and what to leave well enough alone

the REAL ideas are grammar Grammer and GRAMMUR, guess the meanings

state the relevance of each synch between each language element

then geometry, geography, then georganism, and georganization

as our "creation stories" and "histories" are told as the set of lies agreed upon

other thoughts are about chemistry
.
.
.
can see where people are well enough picking up on it

there are 7 major scams in evolution and they're all a species in halo

the real issue is seeing when and how people have become those things, derezzing our special coherence with some imago dei as I've seen someone say or whatever

the mind is a fork, so the well must need to contain the correct poisons or it is itself not even nourishing

this isn't psuedoscience, but the acts of trying to teach is definitively an art of inference and instincts

Libs can only think locally, and they dont even understand the political stances theyre "for".
-Capitalism died in the 1980s with reaganomics
-Which caused a slow but unstoppable decline on the regular joe capital income.
-Millenials were taught to survive in an economy which didnt exist once they became adults, and assume capitalism = big bad man who put them down.
- queer Millenials and zoomers believe republicans are evil cause theyre old school and associate them with every single bully theyve ever had since preeschool.
- Due to the 80s "mental health act", no more mental issues are addressed on the government level
- jews have been playing the long game on mental diseases and acceptance of race, religion and sexual preferences.
- Jew media, both news and cultural media aka shows, books, art, movies, etc has increased their narrative on acceptance, DEI and equality. Increasing it a notch for every year so you dont notice the change. the narrative makes slow learners, low iq and mental health issues havers, assume every race and every religion is as free and as civil as white man's culture.
-Once the seed is planted on sufficient mass of youth minds, they go overboard and crank it up to 11 saying republicans are the complete opposite of your views, and anything coming from them is evil.
-making an easy target to put some really extreme stances on the democrat side, they will be accepted since theyre "from the good camp"
-Trump is used as the evil incarnate, signifying "everything thats bad with the other side", so you have an easy target to point your finger at in disgust.
-Democrat leaders still living in the 90s, think words like "freedom, democracy, liberty" still carry some weight and those brainwashed young masses relate those words with their own special liberties, aka lgbti, "being good" and helping the "oppressed races".
its a cult that divides the US between two camps of a once strong, united country. Jews have won.

The answer is QE. QE enabled and still enables increasingly useless corporate eaters who then have to invent reasons for their existence. Since there wasn't anything that people actually wanted from them, they had to create the need for DEI, green policies, gender agenda and everything else we're seeing. This spawned a whole industry funded by easy money.

>some anon earlier said that the big TSMC project in arizona is entirely dead in the water because of DEI shit.
It was part of the legislation (the vaunted CHIPS Act) that TSMC had to use "diverse" contractors to build the facility, because it's technically a federal government subsidy project. This predictably had the effect of delaying the project for years. They're still behind schedule. It's gotten so bad that TSMC is thinking about bailing on the entire thing if they aren't allowed to bring in their own guys at this point. That's why they're always in the news saying they can't find competent American workers and that they need Taiwanese workers. It's because DC forced them to hire niggers to try and build a state of the art manufacturing facility. Everything in the US revolves around worshipping niggers. Literally everything. It's easily the most evil and gay country that has ever existed. I feel bad for these Taiwanese guys, they have no idea they made a deal with the devil. They should just suck it up and normalize relations with China.

yes because jews actually control the entire money supply and the investment pipeline
they have created the ESG system where you have to hire people that are not white (jews are not white) to qualify for investment
also jews that have infiltrated every level of us government, create DEI programs with subsidies and tax breaks
so there is lot of money in DEI+ESG, which now every corporation will chase
jews truly are making innovative ways to destroy the whites, not only by flooding our countries with non-whites, but when they fail by their own merits, of course, the jews destroy the white meritocracy that made the countries great
but they dont care if everything goes to shit, all they care about is destroying the whites
then the jewish media machine keeps NPCs pacified and filled up with propaganda so they dont even see the connection of the policies and why everything is falling apart at the seams

so lot of new projects going on your neck of the woods, i heard TSMC will spin up new projects in poland instead after seeing the shitshow that is DEI arizona
poland is also one of the last white bastions in EU, the labor force is getting more skilled, while being ex warsaw pact means the wages are still low although rising
seems like a very reasonable place to set up new business
if you manage to fight EU and keep all the non-whites out, poland could actually become significant player in europe
you need to stop being so butthurt over the nazis though, because nazism is what we are going to need in europe if europe is to survive

Because in 2016 /pol/ was a relatively obscure board on a relatively obscure website, the population of which was majority white and unified around a few similar ideologies. Everything was fucked but DEI (DIE, wonder why they chose that acronym?) wasn't implemented yet, BLM didn't exist, and LBTQ+ were still spoken about as a fringe group and were still named LGBT.

The energy was positive and optimistic, everything was fresh and original. The mere idea of Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office may seem unexciting to zoomers but back then it was an absurdity, equal parts hilarious and inspiring. He was an outsider, a brash and outspoken outsider who truly seemed like he was going to change things forever. People rallied around him because they genuinely had someone who sounded like he had their interests at heart, even those of us who didn't buy into his authenticity believed that he was a stepping stone to something greater. The general vibe was that things were awful but we had reached the bottom.

What happened? Donald turned out to be a narcissist with no real convictions who staffed the WH with kikes the moment he got in. He built a bit of fencing, continued illegal immigration, allowed the swamp to fester, and most egregiously he sat back while antiwhite riots took place. He didn't do a thing for his core voter base of working class whites. In fact things became worse for working class whites, and whites in general, under his term.

You can't recapture that momentum or general feeling because it's consigned to history, a moment in time unique to the circumstances of that time period. Things are darker now, people are more despairing than optimistic. Your candidates are no longer Meme Man versus Cartoon Witch but Potential Psychopath versus Mush Brain Retard.

White people are becoming the field niggas. We built an empire that is being usurped. Dumb black people on YT are more and more claiming white people stole everything from them, even though welfare + DEI can't save their shitty nature and culture from being shit. Meanwhile, Whites are the most giving race is being constantly slandered as the opposite, white is synonymous with evil, even when majority of brownies and blackies clearly love to move in next to us. When does it stop? Is this really how we go out? Are we destined to build so much only to serve at the feet of black and brown usurpers?

Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?" "If I find forty-five there," he said, "I will not destroy it."

>Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."

No, I'd say you are responding to the fact that the numbers are prettier/better spaced, and they are better oriented to the outer ring.
But the community college/DEI-bachelor's-program graduates who get to assess you for such things will say that one's worse coz it has only one hand.
Similarly the second "moderate one" just looks like someone who doesn't know how to space elements when drawing them. Very common.

This is why you want to avoid hospitals and, if demented, stay in your little shack in the wilderness, making stone tools or whatever.
"Health" "care" "workers" are the biggest threat to your actual health, next to hospitals themselves.

Well you're not going to get that with a bunch of old conservative boomers from the Reagan days. It'll be a mixed bag depending on what you like (assuming any of this happens at all)
Conservatives would get some wins in le culture war and negative things like DEI, LGBT stuff, 'wokery' etc would be reduced, but the offset is you have to put up with increased levels of sucking up to Israel. I say that because I don't think the more controversial stuff people mention like 'total bans on abortion' are ever going to happen.

Also whenever someone says 'we have to compete with China' it generally equates to 'More cheap immigrant workers'

There's no proof the munitions plants explosions throughout the West are the result of Russian sabotage, it could just as easily be the result of DEI or "cutting corners on safety," as they so frequently claim the Russians are doing

Y decir que la revolución industrial fue por el catolicismo y opus dei es un poco de chiste, obviamente los que mandaban iban a estar a cargo, pero aun así llegamos un poco tarde a ella.

El Catolicismo dio a España sus mejores momentos, desde el Imperio de la Monarquía Católica extendiéndose ayende los mares, hasta la industrialización de España de manos de los tecnócrataa Opus Dei. Una España católica altamente considerada desde los círculos de Viena hasta las academias parisinas o por Tolkien y otros autores ingleses.

I guess you don't understand the concept of esg and dei in corporations. In the US, the kikes at Black Rock, State Street, and Fidelity, which collectively control the majority of outstanding public company shares, have forced nigger hiring and promotion or banks cannot refinance their debt or use a revolver (corporate operations short term loans). This is losing companies fortunes and some obvious things are occuring like Boeing doors falling off. The kike oligarchy is NOT following free market ideas, instead using their monopoly in finance to push political nonsense against their investors' interests. Woke Disney is a similar case study. Sucks you're poor and can't get an apartment though.

>Project 2025 envisions widespread changes across the government, particularly economic and social policies and the role of the federal government and its agencies. The plan proposes taking partisan control of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Commerce, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), dismantling the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and sharply reducing environmental and climate change regulations to favor fossil fuel production.[7][12] The blueprint seeks to institute tax cuts,[13] though its writers disagree on the wisdom of protectionism.[14] Project 2025 recommends abolishing the Department of Education, whose programs would be either transferred to other agencies, or terminated.[15][16] Funding for climate research would be cut while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would be reformed along conservative principles.[17][18] The Project urges government to explicitly reject abortion as health care[19][20] and eliminate coverage of emergency contraception under the Affordable Care Act.[21] The Project seeks to infuse the government with elements of Christianity.[6] It proposes criminalizing pornography,[22] removing legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity,[22][23] and terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs,[3][23] as well as affirmative action.[24] Some conservatives and Republicans have criticized the plan for its stance on climate change[25] and foreign trade.[14]

The horse is never dead enough that we can stop beating it.
An example: Larry Fink creates DEI which trickles down through the gaming industry enforcing a worldview I do not share, onto my hobby of gaming. I consider this direct harm done to me and my hobby. I have a specific grievance with a specific jew whose name is Larry Fink. Now that we have a target in our sights, the next step as I said, is boycotts, so I never ever buy any videogames that have been ruined by Sweet Baby Inc. or other tentacles of the blue octopus that is Larry Fink. I actively and aggressively work against Larry Fink's interests. I regularly comment on what he has done, and what his money has done to ruin what was a healthy male hobby for intelligent kids. They've taken something great that I benefitted from in my childhood and they've corrupted it so future generation will be brainwashed into self-destructive habits. It's sick and it's evil and Larry Fink did that. We can point at Larry Fink and say Larry Fink is an objectively evil man who has done objectively evil things that have actively ruined what was good and replaced it with something unhealthy. The equivalent of goyslop for the idiot masses.

Me and millions of other gamers are waging a quiet but very effective war against Larry Fink, and he will fucking lose because we are legion. He's just one jew with too much money. We'll crush him. He has no idea what he's done, the backlash he's unleashed. We'll never forgive Larry Fink.

It’s amazing how hard these tech companies try to find diversity hires and, yet, as a hiring manager I am always presented with the same usual suspects anyway; male, nerdy, white/asian/indian. Sometimes middle eastern. Nobody else can program, clearly; all the best women in programming are men

I applied at DuckDuckGo and was ignored completely, it’s clear they’re trying super hard to hire the Burger King kids club rainbow of forced diversity there.

At my current tech workplace there are biweekly DEI meetings and we have a DEI “team lead” though they has no team and they is not really leading anything. I have not gone to any of these meetings yet for actual legitimate time conflict reasons but from what I hear it’s basically just a POC/waman bitch fest and so unworthy of my attention. We must pay the DEI theythem a hundred grand a year… is this basically just an insurance policy or something? You need to have at least one mystery meat on staff who can help make you look like you’re progressive? Who knows. Huge waste of time. Ultimately we all know who can and can’t do the work…

You would walk all over them.
First up, if it went nuclear its doubtful if Russia or China have any significant number of nukes that actually work, even if they did you would be delivering 100 for every one of theirs. Most of theirs would be duds or fakes.
In a straight conventional war around the periphery, say a Russian invasion of Poland or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, it would just be plain slaughter. The US enjoys such a qualitative edge that it would be like Space Aliens exterminating a stone age tribe. Its not just firepower and tech either, its command structure, morale, doctrine, and higher echelon leadership that the US has a decisive advantage in. Realistically both China and Russia are not that far removed from Iraq in terms of combat effectiveness. The US could have carried out Desert Storm alone with just one ground division and achieved the same result, basically a one sided turkey shoot.
>BUT MAH US ARMY TRANNIES and DEI HIRES!
If you are fooled by that bullshit then you are hopelessly ignorant. The US military is much smarter and much more competent than you might think.
But if the US wanted to actually invading those countries and occupy them? That's a different story. Still doable but it would require a lengthy and merciless total war requiring a massive ramp up in logistics and the introduction of conscription on a WW2 scale. The American public has little stomach for that, so in that case it would be an initial big win but followed by a forever war which the US would lose to attrition and waning public support. Just wouldn't happen in the first place. You might just get a regime change bullshit type of conclusion followed by a quick withdrawal. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

who in their right mind would want Kamala... it's a very desperate move if this was a coup

Biden's inner circle knew it was going to be bad but probably couldn't stop, hoping for the best..
Outer circle was drinking their own poison: the media lies that all's well

You fell for the culture war meme. Labour and conservatives both do the DEI bullshit to distract you as they rob you blind. "Labour" isn't for the working class; they haven't actually supported investment into building affordable housing or lowering immigration in order to increase wages for the working class. Likewise, what are the "conservatives" conserving? Fuck all! Unlike smaller parties, they hardly had to fight to get to where they are. They're the same people (career politicians) that just pick whichever party is more likely to land them the job. You're utterly retarded if you think they care about you in any way, or that there even is a "left" or "right". And they don't "listen to mass media", you buffoon, they control it!

The problem is "us" - we don't really care because "it" doesn't affect us directly. We're too fat on our own vanity to see what's coming. We don't care until it's knocking at the front door, and then it's too late.

they don't "rig" the elections themselves unless they cant push the goycattle where the want them. consider the following:

>be Mossad/Israel/Jews at large
>be 2016
>have hilary as the shoe in candidate.
>the public instead manages to vote in trump against the odds versus hilary.
>proceed to weaponize the media against him after he shows signs of bucking Aipac backed bureaucracy
>also behind closed doors, get trump to join your cause using blackmail with epstein, financial incentives, etc
>still not comfortable enough with him at the helm in 2020, so force the dems to put old school joe up for election over bernie, yang, etc. out of all the dem candidates that cycle, joe is by far the deepest in with aipac/Israel.
>get biden elected by:
A. steering public opinion in a manufactured crisis (covid)
B. pushing mail in ballots galore
C. paying a handful of key election sites to dump some ballots
>they dont care if joe is old because his immediate cabinet are hardline pro Israel anyway and if he dies, kamala is a puppet for DEI and Israel as well.
> be late 2023/early 2024
>PR is a mess from gaza war
>Joe is bending over backwards for Israel but is catching a ton of flak domestically in the form of protests and tiktok.
>force congress to essentially ban tiktok
>sign a bunch of "antisemitism prevention" laws to keep bad PR out of the press/public rhetoric
>all of a sudden realize that trump has almost entirely flipped to your position.
>also realize that if given the chance in 2028, joe will likely be replaced by either a hard lefty who DOESN'T take Aipac money (think AOC, other squad, etc) or hard righty who doesn't want to bend to Israel either. trump would likely not run a 4th time
>come to consensus that trump is best shot to continue supporting your goals

no taxes also equals:
>no wasted billions of dollars on dead end DOD R&D efforts
>no funding other institutions that actively detract from your standard of living (immigration, ATF, FDA, etc)
>no funding pointless forever wars
>no kickbacks and subsidies to special interests and foreign powers
>no bailouts for corporations who do not see you as anything more than a number
>no bullshit virtue signalling DEI hiring and HR schemes


its a two way street here bud. the problem isn't taxation itself, but the returns for said taxation. for example, I pay considerably more in taxes to the city I work in than the taxes I pay to the small township I live in. I will likely never see any benefit for the city employment taxes. the fact that I have to pay for the "privilege" of working somewhere is utterly preposterous. Anyway, nobody would give a shit about taxes if they actually got something back out of them and had transparency on how it was spent. instead it goes to a nameless faceless black hole that never appears again.

social security is quite literally a ponzi scheme for anyone under 45.

its legitimized extortion at every level of the game. tax codes aren't democratically chosen.

AI and automation are going to replace over 80% of jobs in the coming decades. Then, of the 20% of jobs that are left you are up against DEI, affirmative action, and competing with millions of immigrants who are not going to stop coming/popping out kids. Also, if the hiring manager is a jew/pajeet/asian/white woman you might as well not even apply for the job.

The race war has already been lost and the demographic transformation of the west is irreversible at this point!

The only option left is to do what the Nazi's did after the war and convert to Islam! (1)

It's time to go scorched earth policy! Converting to Islam is the last hope to express your will to power in such a hopeless situation!

The story actually begins with a dogshit American company called McDonnell Douglas (MDD) that was infamous for their ridiculously Jewish management and cost-cutting measures, leading to hilariously dangerous aircraft with retarded designs like a cargo plane whose hatches opened inward, meaning if cargo got wedged against the door, everyone would be trapped inside. HOWEVER, MDD had exclusive access to many government contracts like the F-15 and FA-18, so they were kept afloat for a little while.

In comparison, Boeing was originally a company run almost entirely by white engineers, whose children would inevitably grow up to be expert engineers too and eventually work at Boeing themselves. It wasn't unusual to see three generations of a family working at Boeing. Its (((investors))) decided that they didn't like this because reliable designs were expensive and the safety of goyim was unimportant, so they forced Boeing to aquire MDD (even adopting their logo) and replaced Boeing's executives with MDD's executives. Naturally, this meant that Boeing got all MDD's juicy government contracts too.

MDD's habits of cost-cutting carried over to Boeing, and what better way to save money than to aim for cheap DEI loans and hire Pajeet engineers and coders? And so Boeing planes began to fall out of the sky much like MDD's planes before them.

The unbridled stupidity of hiring blacks and women for positions they're not qualified for claims another victim: the Biden administration. The only reason Kamala got the Vice Presidency is because Biden pledged to do a DEI hire for the role.

The Left would FLIP out. So the plan is Biden. He wins then he'll step down and Kamala in. DEI has royally fucked up the dems and they have painted themselves into a corner. Lets just say this. If Biden DOES step down before the election, it will be Kamala BUT she has an even less chance of winning so I think Biden will stay THEN Kamala when he steps down.

Well, you're on /pol/ for one, though people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

>Nobody's interested.
I can't speak about anyone else, but if I met a Black woman from 4chan, I'd be weirded out and awkward a shit. I'd be the same way with any woman; if she were White, I'd agonize over "oh shit, a White woman" as opposed to "oh shit, a Black woman". So that's not an advertisement for me right there. The point is that these are the kinds of socially inept weirdos you're likely to meet from 4chan, they/we're maybe not the best or easiest friends to make.
20 years on this tranime website, 20 years... I wouldn't come here if I wouldn't love it in some way, but I sure would be more well-adjusted and normal, maybe even have a girlfriend (thank god not in the grand scheme of things, I maintain I'm exhausting to be around), if I hadn't spent the last 2 decades pressing F5 on some imageboard that some weeaboo started. I'm guessing we are in the same boat to point there.
I don't know whether you're a zoomer, I mean holy shit, I hope not, this shit started in 2004, people were just visiting some tee-hee crude website so they could boast about "grpppppgfff *nasal voice* the asshole of the internet. its so bad dude :DDDDDD", scary fucking thought that some teen (sorry, racist 30 year old boomer grandpa) would come here to discuss making friends next to the thread about the SS Ahnenerbe.
It's also disrespectful to yourself (I know, I'm being sanctimonious) to join a club as a Black women where they welcome you (in their own way), but where they also constantly say "fuck Black women". They could at least be nice (plus the /pol/-meetup was more diverse than an average DEI ad campaign), but due to incel blackpill ideology in this dark web site, we have no social awareness.

You have a nonsequitur, nonsensical worldview. And as part of that, women aren't people. Got it.

Learn contentment. Learn that billions of people have lived and died before you, and that billions will come after you. Life is simultaneously not important, and yet each moment is a special treasure. Unironically get off 4chan for a while.

Let's think about this. Your students (customers) are paying more than they ever have before, and you're handling probably twice as many as your position would have two decades ago. Not a gross revenue issue.

Maybe you should be hounding your institution about bloated administrative and sports budgets, particularly executive salaries, the useless DEI department, and "cultural" buildings? Oh, you're totally gungho over diversity and nanny state bullshit? Well, sounds like Shaniqua, Provost Rothsteinblatt, and Pradesh are going to keep getting 25% of your salary for doing fuck all to actually keep the university operating.

What about housing? I bet if we didn't have 20 million mestizos in the state, "citizen" and alien alike, you'd be paying a pittance for much nicer accommodations than you currently have. What's that?

Took years of history lessons, but I got my mother to admit that she doesn't hate Uncle Adolf. I think alot of it also has to do with how her job is pushing dei shit and how she's getting fucking tired of blacks and mudslimes behavior in the nursing field. Also picking up real quick on the media hiding the ethnicity of perpetrators in the new was a dead give away. Hates the lgbt because of the self explained child molesters and diseased hedonists they are.

I can be openly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. around her and she just says "what else is new". I also got her to be actively probing and understand the Jewish question, which really they answered themselves and the James O'Keefe Disney interview put the final nail in the coffin of any having any respect for jews. Fuck she even doubts the numbers of the "holocaust".

For mothersday/her birthday, I got her a benelli m2 and I shit you not, she named it Eva, after Eva Braun, with how beautiful she says the shotgun was.

She is sad to think about grandpa who stormed Normandy at ohama and that had he known whe would happen, he would have turned the landing craft around and shot politicians.

I suspect that I know where this stuff is coming from its from pol and filtered upwards over years into the zeitgeist. We talked here with russian and spain anons over the various communist revolutions and identified that what is going on in the US right now is a cultural revolution reaching its first crescendo soon. The iconoclasm of statues of churchill and licoln during the summer of broken glass 2020 gives it away for sure if somebody still got normalcy bias.

Normally you get 100% an attempted military coup when it goes down most often it fails as splinter faction (taiwan/white army)

DEI is cultural marxism, a jew weapon against you and your people (assuming you are White). OP is probably non-White.

Picrel: From "Who Is Esau-Edom?", Charles A. Weisman, 2022:

>>Why do you suppose the Jews form organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, to monitor and combat ”hate” and to identify ”hate groups?” Would not Esau want to do this? Why is it that it is predominately Jews who promote the ”anti-hate laws” and other ”hate-crime” legislation? If you were Esau-Edom would you not do the same? An Edomite would also want to infiltrate churches and seminaries to get God’s people to believe that there is no God of hate, only a God of love and mercy. The Jews have done just that in Christendom.
>>The Edomite Jews of today are the main ones who are concerned about hate, and with good reason. They are desperately trying to suppress all hate, even any acts or words that could be construed as causing ”mental anguish.” In response to their role as being the ”people against whom the LORD has indignation for ever,” the Jews have made the concept of hate a taboo. The Jew Elie Wiesel stated on Public Television that ”Even hate of hate is dangerous.” This is an example of how paranoid the Edomite Jews are regarding God’s hatred of them, and the lengths they will go to eliminate from the mind’s of God’s people any aspect of the idea of hate.
>>Yes, God hates and has indignation for the Edomite Jews, and if any dare take God’s side on this matter, they will be met with great opposition and persecution from those who believe the Edomite Jews are God’s chosen people.

It's straight out of the protocols. Something about propping up the negro so that he will be able to attract white women, who already have the degenerate gene and just want an excuse. That's the entire reason for outlawing segregation (preventing white people from having their own communities, and making sure access to white people is a shitskin right) on the one hand, and then implementing aggressive affirmative action and dei hiring on the other hand (basically gibs for niggers to buy flashy clothes and cars and things like that to attract gullible young white women). Left to their own devices, the races would segregate, whites would prosper, niggers would fail, and there would be very little race mixing if any. But the jews have really figured out the psychology here, they went right for the weak spot which is degenerate white women. Did white men start banging black women? Hell no. The race into the mud was led by blonde women, egged on and financially supported by jews. They wanted a divided, cesspool multicultural society so that they could blend in and manipulate everything behind the scenes, and to their credit they got it, and they went right after the weakest link which is white women.
>in b4 but white men bang asian girls
Yes because white women turned their back on any white man who isn't a Chad or a Chad light, or a Tyrone or basically any nigger they don't reall seem to distinguish between good-looking niggers and regular niggers, it's a perfectly logical survival strategy and it's a reaction to their strategy. The cat's out of the bag on jews now but it's probably too late to do anything about it, because the demographics are overwhelming especially with children where whites are an absolute minority now in the country their forefathers built, and nobody except maybe Bluto here wants to get kinetic. Everybody thinks they can vote harder or stick their head in the sand and pretend it's not happening. Many such cases, especially in Europe.

DEI adds chaos because communication can be harder with folks from diffeent backgrounds. The objective gets inclear because of the different beliefs, values and norms of each culture. Workers then tend to seperate into social groups by race.
Pretty soon these groups become silos and that is when stuff gets weird and counterproductive. I have heard stories about cast systems popping up in big name tech companies. Liability anyone?

NO.

In 2nd case that's white people. Brown or black people don't provide innovative solutions or perspectives because their iq is low and brain can't keep up with whites.

DEI is actually a good thing. Here's why:
>Diversity
DEI promotes diversity by valuing different perspectives, ideas, and talents. This can lead to more innovative solutions and a healthier organization.
>Equity
DEI ensures that individuals and groups with historical barriers to success have the opportunity to succeed. This is important because it can help to level the playing field, allowing people from all backgrounds to reach their full potential.
>Inclusion
By creating an inclusive environment, people feel welcome and valued for who they are. This can lead to higher job satisfaction and productivity.
>Innovation
DEI fosters environments where diverse thoughts and perspectives lead to greater creativity and innovation. Teams with a range of experiences and viewpoints are more likely to come up with innovative solutions to complex problems.
>Moral Responsibility
It's simply the right thing to do. Every person deserves respect, opportunity, and fair treatment regardless of their background or identity.

The point of the project is to draft the blueprint ahead of Trump's election. Mass firings on day one with replacements appointed from a pre selected list vetted by the Heritage Foundation (I know because I'm applying to be on the list). The idea is to weed out liberals from bureaucratic jobs and replace them with conservatives.

Trump only has to approve the orders, the rest will be set up ahead of time.

For example, Traditionally if Trump were to sign an order banning DEI requirements from government contracts, the sourcing folks in every alphabet agency roll their eyes and don't act. Someone from the White House might call and ask for a report outlining how and when DEI will be eliminated and six months later they get some BS report about why it isn't done yet. This plan gets around that by firing the current sourcing folks and replacing them with a GOP yes man. DEI will be out the next day.

If you attack them for being "Jews" then yes Jews are gonna be like "what the fuck bro?" and rally together. Same as many women, for example, ended up leaving the alt right because of constant rhetoric against them. I'm sure they didn't mean to single out every woman but that was the effect (of constant misogyny).
You haven't actually refuted my point though. Jews are overrepresented in virtually everything.
What is the trendy cool thing right now by the white coastal urban elite? "antiwhite", leftist, DEI shit etc. And of course the elite Jews are gonna be in on that as well, and since Jews are more likely to be ceos and such you will find more Jewish surnames behind it.
Do you think that richer, urbanized coastal white people who are involved in academia, these big fortune companies, tech shit etc, are any less leftwing and "antiwhite" or whatever? The biggest antiwhites Ive ever met were white people, and yes gentiles..

It's a multi-generational problem that's hard baked into American society.

Local K-12 schools are funded in proportion to local real estate taxes in the neighborhood which are proportional to real estate values in the neighborhood. It's a perpetual doom loop that has led to a culture of non-learning and ghetto street smarts being favored over actual learning. All because the schools are so shifty.

It's a situation that whites in charge of the country cannot even wrap their head around let alone even exist. To them the it's like talking about ghosts or a man in the moon. The problem is completely unfathomable as a concept to them.

So instead you get absolute faggots like Biden giving literal hundreds of billions for college handouts when there is a massive chunk of the population not even being prepared FOR college or given even basic proper curriculum in a proper setting set up for learning.

Then on top of it you get local black charlatan leaders focusing on useless DEI gender studies and teaching ebonics instead of actual useful things like English Composition, Economics, Math and Science.

It's a national perpetual doom loop for the lower class which is exacerbated by COMPLETE white leadership apathy and black opportunistic incompetence and corruption.

Because if the current black leadership were actually competent and not corrupt they would be making more noise about it.

I'm a relatively right wing, conservative guy.
I don't like or support "DEI": it is stupid, unjust, and harmful. Whoever is the most qualified candidate for the job.
No I don't believe that le jooz caused that. For one, you leave out all gentiles involved in anti-white/leftist stuff and only bring up Jews. When a goy is involved you just say "le shabbos goy".
Again, I acknowledge Jews are overrepresented, in well...basically everything. We can achieve a lot of evil, a lot of good, a lot of science and a lot of politics. I'm not trying to brag or be chauvinistic: I'm simply speaking about an objective phenomenon. Like pic I posted showed Jews more or less made an entire modern political ideology (on the right wing).
It doesn't explain everything but Jews tend to be smarter, educated, people from big cities.
Most white people of that demographic, tend to be pretty leftist and "antiwhite" too.
Such is a trend.
With or without da Jooz.
DEI comes from affirmative action which was started by JFK an Irishman. Executive Order 10925
>inb4 muh shabbosmeme again
Okay rabbi.
Yes, I take antiJewish things more negatively than antiwhite things. I'm Jewish. It is possible I'm even in some aspect not seeing things 100% clear: I am biased in favor of my people. So are you. What is wrong with that?
However I think genuinely you are overestimating and overracializing the role of Jews in all this.
You continue to group me in with these people i.e. fink as if I'm his acolyte, or he is my best friend and we go out drinking together: in reality I didn't know who he was until just now.

And how did your guns prevent illegals just walking into the US and browing up the place. How did your guns prevent feral rabbis from butchering your infant penis? You won't do shit with your guns, your emasculation has lead you to embrace guns as a coping mechanism, but you only talk the talk. You're 100% domesticated cattle, the jews fully control your every thought and emotion, enjoy your brown america, complete with DEI and trannies, and obligatory globohomo indoctrination for your kids in schools.

This is really dependent on the state and district the teacher is working in. Even in the same city, two schools can be very different because of the local school board.
In my state, the school is funded by the district's property tax. Rich areas get well funded schools. Poor rural areas get poorly funded schools. Some schools give teachers a budget for classroom supplies, others don't.
The thing about those hours worked, 180 school days and 1000 hours is what is required for classroom instruction for a student, not a teacher. Teachers are salaried and often have to do after school activities as well as Parent Teacher Conferences and Continuing Education. If they actually want to be involved with other school functions like dances or games, that's even more hours that aren't really paid.
Then there's the issue of teachers don't really get a lot of freedom in their lesson plans, most of that is also set by the administration. Common core does have some good points, but it's a large reason for why test scores are going down.
And let's not forget about the Republicans riling people up about CRT, DEI and Woke culture that got people to come and yell at public school board meetings, many of these people who didn't even have children at the school, to the point where they needed an armed police officer at the meetings. They keep trying to suck money out of public schools to pay for vouchers to private schools and are hostile in general towards public school teachers. Who would want that job? But that's the point, they're trying to destroy public education.

Are you gonna claim the images are fake too? You could argue that the footage from Apollo 11 are shady the but there is an overwhelming amount of evidence surrounding the Apollo missions, new technology developed and built and it's all very documented with thousands of people directly involved with designing and monitoring the missions, not to mention they did it again, and then again, totaling 7 times. It's not some secret launch from the middle of Kazakhstan at night with an unspecified rocket, it's all very out there and even if you ignore that actual launch it's very obvious someone had made a rocket that can go to the moon and bring people back safely.

Because the West’s countries have zero national pride left, they’re using a new kind of pride to attract Zoomers to conscript to their militaries—queer alphabet mafia pride.

As silly as it is, it’s also devastatingly sad since so few young people seem to give a shit about their countries anymore. All they want is social media doom-scrolling and endless vidya.

All Joe has is a gimmick where he dumps all his toxic media shit on his son.

>it's because it's innocuous and innocent until you desire for a commonly shared foundation of rationality and a common bond across all men and women, not merely another effort at segregation of the cattle and the elect and the parasites.
Yeah, that's a feel... it's like this is the era of the social minefield, you always have to be on eggshells around everyone you're not friends with for years and 100% sure you're on the same page with your views or suddenly a DEI moment explodes in your face (funny how DEI is IED spelled backwards).

>There's a whole lot that could be changed in terms of how resources are redistributed and used. [...]
It seems like everyone knows this, but at least part of the problem is that there's not much unity on what those changes should be outside of the broadest and most basic things. I chalk this up to the younger generations being more poorly educated on economics and political theory (and in general, really) since NCLB and Common Core went into effect.

>It's not right only because you can pretend like your [...] because someone (deliberately) failed somewhere else?
I will admit I'm a little separated from of the worst problems of our zeitgeist. It's always tempting to say, "stand and fight," but it's true economic and demographic scenario is utterly fucked, and at this point it will be a miracle if the violence that's already come out of it doesn't spread into WW3. Still, I think even if things are particularly shit, those who can't stay to "fight" still have a few places left they can retreat to before it's really time to consider ending themselves.

And your right, a lot of fucking jobs wouldn't exist if programmed obsolescence and other such bullshit wasn't around.

Christ doesn't care about skin color. He came to save ALL the nations. Many early Christians were Jews and many Jews have come into Christ's Church. Jews are made in the Imago Dei and deserve compassion NOT hatred.

If racial difference wasn't a thing there would be no DEI and no need for affirmative action.

Owen Benjamin has always been a lightweight and the drinking isn't doing him any favors.

Exactly. In fact this conclusively proves that DEI etc was created by neo-liberal zionists to stoke culture wars so everyone looks away from Wall Street fucking them in the ass. The one type of identity politics they don't push is class (representation tellingly doesn't apply to working class people, and also doesn't apply to the senior boards which are heavily Jewish.

I posted a few days back in /tv/ that it's been a resounding success for them, because the Wokes and the Chuds were even dumber than their wildest dreams.

Even if Western citizens are able to get ahold of Russian drone videos showing Ukrainian soldiers being burned alive or dismembered, which obviously exist, posting them publicly will quickly land them in hot water with law enforcement for "materially supporting" a sanctioned state; i.e., with "propaganda" in this case. That, which is effectively censorship, allows paid 24/7 glownigger operatives like Gore Leaf to make it appear to the normies that Ukraine is "winning" and Russia is being "demoralized," just as the media and deep state were able to pull the wool over normies' eyes for so long "in terms of" (to use retard DEI hire Kamala Harris' pet phrase) Biden's rapidly declining mental health.

I think the moral of the story is there is no ukranians there to force the astronauts back into the Boeing starliner and tell them to plummet to their very possible deaths.

I’ll be honest, there’s a very high likelihood of them dying.

Sorry, not sorry Boeing. I know you guys didn’t have a choice with affirmative action and then DEI but next time around, fight to the death not to hire niggers. Or else it’ll cost you absolutely everything, which from the looks of it between planes and now this is a sure thing with more niggers.

Make more drones too and keep niggers out of those departments. They won’t sue now because they know they’ll end up dead.

It seemed like such a horrible choice paired with someone who was so old that many doubted he would even make it through a full term. They picked her solely for her skin color and gender even though she was one of the worst candidates for the job. Now they have to live with that decision. This is what DEI gets you.

No. Not even close. The media and half of American voters have been completely brain broken by Trump. Trump is too old to run again. This is it. This is a compass election. Trump winning = libtards went too far (the media is already acknowledging this with regards to how they cover Biden). But if Trump loses? It will be the DEI States of America from now on and every Republican after Trump will adjust to this mold.

How many blacks? 3? Lol don't make me laugh. Westerners take the ammount of black tourists in Russia, multiply it by 10 and hand them citizenship daily. That's how absurd the difference is and Muslims have always existed in Russia, just like other ethnic groups because they literally have the biggest country in the world that stretches over a big chunk of Asia.

The government didn't kill whites because they were whites, unlike the current western governments that literally say in public that they are working to end their own people. Soviets killed everyone, including other ethnic minorities. Everyone starved equally. Literally related to how communism works and has nothing to do with the concept of globalism that westerners so fiercely protect nowadays.

Just so you know, jews literally invented all the things like feminism, and push for DEI, racemixing, and so on.
They literally owned the ships and the slaves they brought in.
They literally turned america into the pit it is today.
They are literally responsible for doing it and exporting it into every european country as well.
And they literally control russia as well.

I repeat, you will go this nation and that nation, this part and that party.
But ultimately it comes down to one simple question.
Is this thing for or against the global jewish ruling party, or not.
If it is, it will mouth the words while supporting jews and do nothing of significance.
And if it's against them, it will be quickly destroyed.

See what their stance is on the jewish question. That alone will tell you if they honestly have any care in the world against issues like migration and genocide of whites through physical replacement or cultural destruction.
left and right, blue and red, socalist this or that.
None of it matters.
Give me an actual party that is different.
All other parties are pro jew, give me the party that is against them. Any nation, any party that every seriously held that position was quickly targeted and destroyed.
Thus the only thing you can get these days is somebody who mouths the words like "im against immigration" but then they will turn around and say jews are their greatest ally and don't you dare question holocaust.

It's more because them and the other two Big Three asset management companies are the majority shareholders of 88% of the S&P 500, meaning they own nearly 9 out of 10 of all major companies in the United States. They are legally permitted to sue for negligence any company they believe is not participating in the interest of their profits, which they dictate is the tenets of their ESG program. The reason you know what ESG and DEI are are because Blackrock invented them and is holding the entire stock market hostage under them.

You don't get it do you?

Boeing has a shitty DEI score, they aren't hiring dozens of pajeets and Nigerian engineers they hire their DEI bullshit positions low end of the totem pole to fill their "share".
What's happening is that Boeings shareholders are maturing and either looking to cash out big time or their trust fund kids are cashing out or trying to squeeze as much profit as possible from the operations, and at the same time corporations are lobbying government to deregulate safety standards so when an audit goes in they've lowered the bar so shit slips through the cracks.

Back when Boeing was new they had the same motto as NASA pretty much a 99% go rate for safety, and that was highly regulated by the government because it was part of the national security programs they ran.

There's a reason why China doesn't manufacture shit kind of shit because the safety standards are abysmal there. And before you yell

Thanks to DEI all of those positions of wealth or power Gen X was waiting for because boomers won’t retire will be given to Gen Y black women. You’re barking up the wrong tree trying to meme Gen X into “the Karen” generation. Everybody knows they don’t care.

You’re right but also wrong imo. No one likes her, but the Democratic Party would be throwing what would be the first woman president overboard, most likely for a white dude, and the optics for that (while the right wing is currently harping on about muh DEI) would not be good for a progressive party. It doesn’t fix the fundamental infighting problem that they’re dealing with and it becomes ammo for opponents.

>*ruins your national team in your path*
Want to know why the best coach the U.S. can afford is Gregg Berhalter? Because they can only pay the USMNT coach the same amount as the USWNT coach. Due to "equal pay" DEI bullshit even though the USMNT makes more money.

Forbes reports that Emma Hayes' salary, coach of the U.S. women's team, will match that of U.S. men's head coach Gregg Berhalter, which was listed as $1.6 million for the 2022 calendar year, and according to Doug McIntyre of Fox Sports, they will both continue forward at that same number.

As such, Hayes will make triple what former head coach Vlatko Andonovski was paid, as the previous head man earned $450,000 per year, according to U.S. Soccer financial filings.

Thanks USWNT, you fucking cunts!

The dei madness ,besides being offensive and hostile Marxism, is constant. It is as if there is an endless money supply to waste on brand names to ruin, media and entertainment to be extinguished, and commercials that no one can relate to.
For example, i watch a lot of woodworking ,diy content, history on YouTube. Almost every fucking commercial is for blacks, gay people, women, always mixed couples, and most white people are the "jerk" in a ads.....all of this while I'm watching Paul Sellers teach how to cut dovetails.

I just don't see how this wasn't blocked. Perhaps they were afraid of discrimination lawsuits, but it's a bad look to let it slide and wait for public outcry against it.

I suppose if the latter is the case, then we need to make lawfare against companies that don't want DEI and Woke stuff to have legal protections to allow them to avoid sexual marketing.

The financialjews have managed to create a post-capitalist economy where things like revenue and P/e ratio don't matter.
Stock prices today are based on speculation and how much the company supports wokeness and judeo-globohomo.
Even if the people who manage the investments made by the large institutional investors who drive the market think all of the woke DEI stuff is bullshit, it doesn't matter. They know that the other investors will invest in a company whose ESG score improves, so they do it too because they have a fiduciary duty to try to invest in things whose value is going to increase. And when everyone is buying shares of the woke ESG company, the value goes up, confirming that ESG increasing equals stock price increasing.
There is also speculation involved with things like people thinking that companies like Nvidia or Tesla will eventually become the top company in some huge, extremely lucrative field. So they price them as if they already are that huge, top company and the valuation increase gets baked into the price today. But if that company does gradually start to become that huge behemoth company, why would the price continue to rocket up? That future valuation is already baked in.
Also, inflation. Dollars are worth less so everything else costs more dollars to buy, including shares of companies. A lot of the "growth" recently is really just the effects of inflation. It's not any different than charting the price of Big Macs over time and seeing the line constantly going up.

There are some people who are stupid enough to fall for that sort of thing, and we have to warn them. Here's a better test: in any given war or event in which the system wants you to participate, ask how the event will work to undermine the power of elites/Jews/etc. in your country.

If there is no clear answer to that question, then don't participate. The last thing you want to do is to reinforce the power of those groups.

If you do a deep dive into this man's history, you will understand his strategy in time. Good old Jupiter is not like you or I. A student of Hegel and, Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli, his warning about France having a "civil war" if not elected will atleast come to some kind of fruition. Wasn't it Albert Pike who said "when the people need a hero, we will rise one up for them".

A former Rothschild banker who rose up the ranks in record time, a virtual unknown will come once more to save Europe from the ashes, of the very fire his ilk set, and rescue her from being pulled apart from the left, and from the right.

Orchestrated chaos will grip Europe and much of the world in the coming years, and a little horn will blow for a call for order, and it will say "We are all in this togeather".

The donkey and the camel will make peace, and the man in the Vatican will wash feet.They will warn you about WW2, and how we mustn't forget, while the unheard voice will plead that you must remember, it is the Victor who writes the page that the feeble find truth. The Wise will know truth, because the truth is Christ.

definitely witnessed this firsthand going through a clinical mental health counseling program, both from instructors/administrators and classmates

it's especially prevalent in the addiction recovery world IMO, or maybe i'm just exposed to it more because that's the field i work in directly. i think the fact that drug users aren't viewed as human brings out the absolute worst in these psychopaths. i could tell some stories, man

the interesting thing is, i get the stories on how these clinical psychologists/psychiatrists behave directly from the people who experienced them firsthand (think: being held in restraints for 24 hrs in freezing rooms for noncompliance, having meds withheld, having meds/sedatives administered punitively for "noncompliance," being placed in restrictive care for inappropriate reasons)

then, because i sit on boards/working groups with these same psychopaths, i get to see how they behave around people who they have to wear their mask in front of (think city and county level elected officials, administrators, etc) and hear them talk about how caring and compassionate they are

there are two people in particular that i am fairly convinced are actually possessed by demons. both work at catholic medical facilities, and are extremely invested in both covid vaccine adminstration and woke/DEI/ESG inclusive initiatives, go figure.

The latest trend in “viral marketing” is to host a giveaway. Several companies will participate, each donating products. When you sign up, you’re added to their mailing lists.

They're evil people. Being loved would require them to be, benevolent.
As far as hiding fortunes go, the rothchilds do that much.

>So DEI is intelligent now?
you misunderstand the obvious goal of these programs; that being to subvert and undermine the host population. They're trying to demoralize and enslave everyone.

I wouldn't say that this is wise, but wisdom and intelligence aren't the same thing.

Go ahead and post the nepo / DEI hires that run companies they could have never started on their own. I don't give a shit. My pay's gone up 90% in the last 30 months. I keep getting hired to fix / re-write shit Pajeets totally fucked up after they and the finance bro dipshits who hired them get fired. In my last job I was hired to automate a bunch of back office tasks. They hired pajeets to do it and they said they did. In the end, all they did was take turns waking up in the middle of the night to manually run the tasks. Literally the day they all got fired, all of the "automated" tasks stopped running because no one was around to wake up at 3 AM and run them anymore.

We just terminated our entire development department and are replacing them with 2 guys that use AI to stich together world leading software projects.

Shit quality? No we perform 2-3x better than our competitors that often hire the DEI people to do their code while we have probably 50-70% less overhead and our time to market is 12-14x faster!

We are a beta tester for a company creating AI coders and the latest stuff just blows your mind.

These 2 guys mostly validate and test while checking it all makes sense.

I love seeing the sad beta boi faces trying to find work, from our previous guys 2 have found jobs

Affirmative action hires went from doing some makeshift work to positions of power thanks to the DEI policies and so it's harder for western companies to produce quality content so they're churning out crude propaganda.

Average American wages are about 4x Chinese, and American profit is about 20% higher. You will pay at least 5x more for the DEI version, and at least 10x more for the White one.

Not even joking. DEI is a shit. When you fire all the white people and can't hire enough competent negroes to actually be ground crews, you end up with an absolutely slammed airport that can't handle the traffic that it has.

What's the common thread between Boston, LA, Philly, and Las Vegas? Niggers.

The sheboon was warned 3 times: once at the emergency safety meeting concerning that specific incoming flight, then again as a reminder just before the plane arrived.
The incoming plane had an electrical issue that required hooking up auxiliary power cables before shutting the engines down. Ground crew was told to avoid the plane until its yellow warning light turned off, and to stay clear of the yellow lines on the tarmac that would mark the danger zone surrounding the plane.
Despite being told to stay clear of the plane until its flashing yellow warning light was turned off, she crossed the yellow line to walk behind the running engine and was blown off her feet.
The last warning ("Shaniqua! Get yo black ass way from dat plane U stupid bitch!") was also ignored, thus the path to her Darwin Award was made ready.
With a bobble-headed "nuh uh I ain tryna lissen none dat boo shit" she waddled in front of the engine, which sucked her in and shredded her bulbous bloated ass into a fine spray of used-to-be-a-darkie.
The best part: Her family leapt at the opportunity for a Ghetto Lottery, claiming she dindu nuffin and was working on a holiday to support dem kids. No mention of the passengers who were traumatized and inconvenienced, no mention of the grounded plane and its ruined engine. No mention of her disregard for the safety rules, nor that the sheboon brought this fate on herself after multiple warnings.
> tl;dr DEI, LOL

>economist: a professional excel and power point whore that makes pretty pictures to try and try to make banks / corporations / funds feel better about their shit investments, or sell corporations on shit like DEI loans

You just listed 4 of the most empty jobs in the world. This sounds like some 12-16yr old asian kit regurgitating what his mom wants him to be. I mean, why did you not put sales down? It's higher paying and more con-artist oriented than all four combined.

The only people who actually effect the "state of society" are philanthropist, volunteers, people who run non-profit organizations / NGOs that dictate how the philanthropist money is spent and what the volunteers do. Churches used to effect this a lot more, but they decided that private jets and Las Vegas style shows were way more important than how people vote and what children are taught in schools.

You sir, are a buffoon. The worst kind of buffoon, an arrogant one.

Affirmative action makes sense from both capitalist and democratic perspectives. Most people are brown, so why would they buy from a company that only hires white people? Why would they support public services that only employ white people? This is what anti-DEI rightoids fail to understand.
