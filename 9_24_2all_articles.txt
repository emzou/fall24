I'm a massive youtuber, and I learned the hard way not to FUCK with this game.

1) There are certain "smaller" youtubers who are getting insane amount of views on their Concord video guides, yet the game is full dead, and there's no comments on their videos. No actual real organic traffic. Just fake / bought / forced view counts. Super odd.

2) If you trolled the Steam forums about the game, you were met with immediate Steam perma-bans. I had to subpoena Steam to get unbanned over a shitty troll post I made about how I'd shill their game too if they paid me. They backpedaled and said that a Sony Exec flagged my account as hijacked. Lol?

3) No game that has 400m blown on it doesn't just "forget" to hire the "main" shills. AnnieSuckCocks, Asmonbald, etc. There are certain twitch and youtube creators that are ALWAYS playing the "newest" sloppa game then abandoning it immediately. Remember Pax Dei?

4) Pic is semi related, the entire youtube/twitch ecosystem is fake and corrupted as fuck. If I made a video hating on Concord I'd get perma-banned off the platform cause I'm not sucking Blackrock cock.

It is very, very clear to me which party stand with Israel and zionists, it's Trump. Every single account shilling for Israel on twitter is a hardcore Trump supporter. Trump loves Israel and says without him Israel won't exist and even says he will deport people who don't like Israel. Now this doesn't mean i'm voting for the DEI hire, but Trump lost my vote.

It'll be interesting to see what happens to Ubisoft after they release AC Shadows starring George Floyd as Yasuke the Samurai. Their latest Star Wars game flopped, and they spent $100s of millions developing it. This might be the turning point if they end up going under due to their DEI and woke bullshit.

>The issue with promoting incompetence is that it tends to bite the virtue signaler in the ass even more and eventually everyone working the propaganda machine will be too retarded to make it palatable.
The problem with pozzed/DEI/diversity/antiwhite content is that the audience knows it's antiwhite and it breaks the suspension of disbelief. Immersion is destroyed. Same goes for video games.
The market for good media that doesn't lecture you, even implicitly, is huge IMO. Yet existing media production houses do not serve this market.

Trump has a bigger percentage of black people at his rallies. You're going to try and tell me that a democrat, a black female, goes into a democrat stronghold like Charlotte and the crowd is whiter than New Hampshire ??? Look at Biden rallies in the same place, or if you dare tapes of Obama rallies. methinks the racists wanted white people for their fake crowds because they think they will do better playing the assigned roles. so much for DEI hiring.

The rising minimum wage is a jew grift. The idea is that the companies can't afford it, so they either close or take out a special business liquidity loan with complex terms and conds for paying it back. These terms include dei hiring, celebrating nigger month and stuff. Anyone who views the terms has to sign a nda. I viewed such a loan arrangement for Sainsburys supermarkets in the uk but the nda has now expired. This was way back in 2012. That is one of the ways the jew bankers are socially engineering the corporate world.

Anyone that's watched her for a lengthy period of time can see that she is severely lacking in confidence. She NEEDS a script, a guide, and handlers to take care of everything because there is no getting any genuine authenticity out of her.

She is painfully insecure and unsure of herself, and once you notice it you can't unsee it. Comes with the territory if you got everything on your back and then becoming a DEI chameleon while developing zero other skills in the meantime.

Also doesn't help she says whatever will get her them most brownie points 'thay day' with little regard for tomorrow giving the impression she has no actual beliefs which i know is all politicians but kamala seemingly believes in absolutely nothing even for an entrenched high ranking politician.

Western missile tech is very good, no doubt about it, but it costs absolutely insane sums and the factories make 20 missiles a month.
Kinda the same problem as with other equipment. It's not technically bad, just 2 or 3 times more expensive than it ought to be.
Worsened still by expensive R&D programs, all of which miss deadlines and most of which end up being cancelled or nerfed to fuck. Spending 5 billion on R&D to then procue only 100 items adds 50 million to the cost per piece.
An unholy trinity of corruption, incompetence and lack of accountability.

That's exactly it. People fall into bubbles, they embark on their own personal little rat race and never see the person walking past them in the street. If they truly understood how bad things are on average they would be terrified. But they are clueless, so they don't understand where this immigrant DEI road finally leads. If I had to guess it's going to be like south Africa knocks up Brazil and America is the fetal tissue in the gutter from a planned parenthood abortion. The elites being the stem cells harvested and sold to Jews of course.

imagine a hiring rubric where all candidates considered score 10 out of 10 (for every job there is 5000 resumes). now add DEI criteria. this tips the scale 100% of the time out of your 10/10 candidate pool toward everything else besides whites and males.

You're half right I think. Nobody watched the Wire while it was on TV tho. HBO was for smart people of means that wanted to dabble in more high-minded programming with a movie-tier production value. They invented that and it's what has slowly become the norm by way of Mad Men/the meth show and now streaming as a whole.
Streaming sucks now for a lot of reasons, DEI hires, algo-story writing etc...the most interesting reason to me is that they just acquire pre-made content now because it's cheaper than investing in a creative mind and letting them take the story where ever they want to go. This is the same reason movies suck and rely on derivative IP recycling. The few great "auteurs" we have left are White men from the 90's that were able to establish themselves before the Jews decided to tear down their own house.

Because she has chosen to not have white children. She has abandoned her most important duty as a woman and chosen to grift lonely men through the vague promise of that duty. On that fundamental level she's a roastie and will never be "based." On the only level that matters she's no better than a purple haired screaming feminist.

She should only be viewed in terms that her anti dei can be somewhat useful for propaganda purposes.

Major Corporations are Ditching Annual Pro-LGBTQIAAP2S+ Report Card Amid Increasing DEI Backlash Anonymous ID:ghyvhrMK Fri 20 Sep 2024 04:57:25 No.482293830  Replies: 9 ViewReport
Despite some companies backing away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Human Rights Campaign still profits handsomely from businesses committing to its standards.

More and more large corporations are choosing not to actively participate in the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC) annual “Corporate Equality Index” that judges and ranks large companies based on their fealty to the ever-evolving will of LGBTQ+ activists.

In recent months, Ford Motor Company, Harley Davidson, Jack Daniel’s, Molson Coors beer, and Lowe’s have parted ways with HRC’s yearly “report card.” Other corporate giants such as John Deere and Tractor Supply have in a more general way stepped away from their commitments to woke DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards that entail the promotion of homosexuality and transgenderism.

In a statement published in August after Harley Davidson distanced itself from the LGBTQ+ lobbying Goliath’s strong-armed tactics, HRC insisted that the “choice to back away from the Corporate Equality Index is an impulsive decision fueled by fringe right-wing actors and MAGA extremists who believe they can bully their way into dismantling initiatives that help everyone thrive in the workplace.”

After the high-profile desertions, HRC has gone so far as to declare a “State of Emergency” for LGBTQ+ people in the U.S., suggesting that it’s now open season on gays, lesbians, transgenders, and others who live their lives in allegiance to everything the rainbow flag stands for.

By sounding a false alarm about its favorite bogeyman contrivance — conservative “attacks” on LGBTQ+ folks — HRC has developed an extremely profitable way to earn a living over the years.

In 2023, records show that HRC’s total revenue was just shy of $50 million, with over 90% coming from contributions.

HBO was always pozzed. They just had to actually make it entertaining, or nobody would pay $30 a month for their stupid channel. They were also, at one point, the only game in town. It took nearly a decade before Showtime even started to compete with them. Nobody else was making these kinds of edgy, controversial, thought-provoking television. Then Game of Thrones happened.
Nobody gives a fuck about HBO ever since Game of Thrones had the walking episode, so now the channel is dead. They'll never see another moment of cultural relevance, because now HBO is just another streaming service in a sea of cultural irrelevance. All entertainment is atomized now. When we were all stuck watching from one source, we could all engage together. We could all enjoy the same cultural milestones together. Now that's all over. All dead. HBO will never be big again because they killed the biggest thing they ever did. They slaughtered it right in front of 8 billion people. That's what HBO has always done, though. They always kill their shows at the end. Oz, Sopranos, Rome, True Blood, The Wire. They all get murdered in the last season/episode. Killing Game of Thrones was going too far. They could have stayed massive. But instead? Nope. Ask yourself; "Who the fuck cares aobut HBO?" Nobody.

Now anons will say it's because of DEI bullshit, but will tell you, again, that HBO was always pozzed. They were sane about it, comparatively speaking. They didn't need to go "Woke" to go broke. All they had to do was write a blank check to two greedy kikes.

Let’s start at the end and keep it simple.
- spent years canvassing, organizing and getting out the vote
- spent years fighting draconian lockdowns, radical BLM/Jewish Antifa activists which turned me away from big tent civic nationalism
- spent years fighting vaccine mandates, DEI and woke anti-white politics
- lost a ton of business and local chairmanships for saying we needed election reform
- lost the rest of it after January 6th simply by association and being vocally pro-Trump
- spent 3 years pushing election reform and investigations into the 2020 election anyway
MAGA went from being a no-bullshit pro-everybody outsiders who wanted to put AMERICANS FIRST. If you don’t like it too fucking bad.
To now being another flavor of establishment politics where you pander for votes, give way too many concessions, and worry about someone calling you racist or antisemitic. Establishment pandering is NOT what won 2016 and the RNC knows this - they’re just faggots and have always hated trump and still hate trump. Without trump their party is dead. Without trump their party was technically already dead but he revived it and gave them life. And now they’re squandering it because they’re dumb faggots.

If it is affirmative action, it is just as much a help to Rhode Island and Hawaii as it is to Alabama, so invoking the "red state" part is somewhat off-base. And it isn't designed to retroactively cure some past ill like affirmative action. The comparison to DEI is somewhat apt, because it seeks to "include" states with lesser population. But the reasons for why you would be in favor of or against either are different, in part because the reason for implementing both are different, so any attempt to paint the red states as hypocrites in this regard is somewhat dubious.

Not that it matters because the problem is dei low IQ guards, but in terms of Jail/Prison. Jails are usually short term holding facilities for people awaiting trial/transfer/very light sentences and don't actually have the gangs you hear about. in some ways jails fucking suck because you usually can't get a job to earn money and the food is fucking terrible.
Prisons are more for people after they are sentenced and doing more than a year. This is where gangs and the soap memes apply. But prisons are also usually a better stay in terms of facilities and programs because they are meant for long term incarceration.

People still need to retain the information and understanding of modern technology and theory or you will hage entire industries end up like nasa. And to be quiet honest I feel like once boomers die and dei/women/brown hordes turn out to be a scam were fucked.
The only reason college is and seen as a scam is because of equity bs. A bs in stem used to mean something and get you a good job where you'd be trained or showed job related knowledge. Now they require masters degrees as an excuse to bring in 3rd world h1bs or rich foreigners.
At my major state college after freshman but definitely sophomore year, in stem, the only nonwhites were asians and maybe 20% of the students female.

it sounds like DEI, but it's not. DEI is about representation based on attributes, where senate numbers is about population despite attributes, if the blue states want to fill their cities and towns with non citizens and allow them to vote, then red states should be allowed to combat that.

Slavery was a non-issue in the 18th century, and slaves did not have the right to vote either nor were counted in official polls for governance purposes
The reason why slave owners were seemingly paradoxically in support of enfranchising blacks is precisely because it would add weight to their own votes, as the slaves would vote in accordance with their masters for obvious reasons

Original reasons were the lack of funding post cold war, the established tank fleet they already had and the fact there was no enemy to prepare for.

Its not DEI its just equity and yes you have to equity to all state or else they won't stay part of the union. The reason that every state gets two senator is to prevent urban states dictating to rural states. Considering that the rural states could live without the urban states, but not the inverse shows that equity must be taken into account. The rural states produce the food for them. Federal law exist to handle crime across state lines, allow commerce between States, and to organize interstate collective projects like national defense. The purpose of federal law is not to go around making dictates on every aspect of life. That's why we have a divide between state and federal law. The leftist can't stand that there are people that are living normal lives by their own self determined laws, so they run to the federal government to enforce their tyranny on the rural states which is bullshit. Its why the founding fathers made divide in Congress specifically to prevent that.

It does matter how often they bomb when the tax payer gravy train cash is a constant. I think Larry (the rat) Fink and his gay butt bussies should all be murdered, I can think of very few more deserving.

There is financial incentive to hire less competent and trustworthy foreign workers. At first these companies wanted to squeeze profits by hiring cheaper labor. Then DEI came along and there was financial incentive to promote them. Then all they do is hire their own, partially out of racism, but also as a way to chain migrate family and friends over.

Now we’re having all of these “security breaches.” I’ll only write so much of that off to incompetence. These people are getting paid to infiltrate snd compromise. It is not only taking jobs away but it is destabilizing our infrastructure. It is a matter of national security our government does nothing about.

I went once when the kids were tiny for their birthday and they loved it. Crappy slop and the waitress had a cake and sang happy birthday which was lovely. Sour experience though cos as mentioned, the drinks cost more than the food and the entire visit cost as much as a decent restaurant but the environment felt like eating at burgerking with table service.

I am surprised they've gone under though cos the target market loves overpriced slop and eating out. From what i can see the target market earns more than ever before and eats slop out more than ever before.

I suspect there is another reason forvthe closure. Possibly that they, like quite a few existing businesses, couldn't meet the dei terms of the business loans that give them the liquidity to trade. People tend to work at the places they would otherwise be the natural customer profile to and, goyslop it may be, but tgi friday wasn't a negro favourite for some niggy reason. That in itself may also be a factor; if the nigs aint down for it, neither is extreme far left supremacy Britain and their disgusting love for anything that isn't English, asthestic or wholesome.

Anon, the US is in the business of making money. That's above all else. Technological innovations? Who gives a fuck as long as there's a buyer?
>suddenly, russia, china, iran, et al... start producing hypersonic missiles that cannot be conventionally-
>Oy vey!
-shut it down!

And now everyone's kvetching because their money making schemes are in jeopardy. Well, the stonks are still going up, so for now it's all good. Anyway, in terms of tech it's definitely corruption, incompetence, nepotism, PR DEI stunts, and so on... if they operated on a purely meritocratic system, they'd already have it a decade before their competition. Well maybe not before Russia, the Russians are all in invested into missile tech since the Cold War and really damn good at it.

Regardless, still waiting for nukes to start getting fired. It's getting kinda stale.

That's not the reason why. They screwed over some of their main engineers and their families, probably. Not necessarily DEI for the experienced engineers. DEI they were hoping would help them catch up, but it probably won't work out for them and has guaranteed them needing to give up the project.

Black babies are made in the Imago Dei and deserve to live.

The biggest ethnic cleansing of ALL TIME is that of black babies by abortion. Nearly HALF of all babies killed by abortion are black, and nearly 40% of black pregnancies end with the baby being killed in the womb. As blacks are only 13% of the population these numbers are horrific

Listen, you need to understand the current phenomenon because it's new. I'll break it down for you.
Back in the day, topics of this technical nature were pretty hard to cover en masse, because most shills are retarded they do not have the technical understanding of reality.
Thus, back in the day some high IQ anon could wipe the floor with these retards. But these days, what is happening is these low IQ brainlets are AI assisted, they don't have to research shit then come back with an argument after a few days. They get fast help from AI which is already good enough to work, at least on certain other even medium IQ reading their posts.
And this will only get worse in the future, these shills are completely incompetent DEI failures in life that get a second change by being AI assisted, when you probe them fast they can't think, they don't know shit for shit and some of them give themselves away as using AI by the type of nonsense they respond with.
We aren't fighting shills, we're fighting AI assisted shills, which becomes harder with their way higher number.

The first attempt was so fucking blatant and obvious. The fact that it's been completely memory holed, is enough reason for them to try again ad infinitum, because they know there will be absolutely no consequences whatsoever if by some miracle the DEI hires pull off a miracle. There's a pool of tens of millions of MSNBC programmed fucking lunatics for them to choose from, drug up, and send at Trump, until one finally succeeds, all it depends on is if the glowniggers are competent enough to 'let things happen' without fucking it up.

They subvert colleges too. The problem was that they pushed their DEI shit super hard, so the heads of the colleges were often groids, like at Harvard. They had too many nogs, spics, and others within the college elite positions + literal DEI offices to make sure they had DEI on campus. After all the woke brainwashing shit, they had to fill them up with minority quotas. The problem for the kikes, is that they had earmarked themselves as minorities, but the actual minorities simply viewed them as white and wouldn't allow it to go through
> Which they tried to subvert people into believing for a few years, by jews ALWAYS saying on social media, magazine/newspaper articles, etc, that they were not white, they were jewish.
So, they got fucked with their 4D plan to put themselves on top with all the special treatment and extra priveliges as a jew "minority", with only whites not having those priveliges, nor special treatment. Instead, kikes were grouped with us, and they revolted against DEI at that point.
>Then, the moment that the college campus protests kept going because of the woke indoctrination, about colonialism and white people bad, brown people as victims (the woke thought kikes were white, and Palestinians were brown), they fought super hard against the kikes, and had super support to Palestinians... even the woke jews believed it

So, once they realized that simply cracking down with cops wasn't enough, they started firing all the DEI hire president's of colleges and other minorities that were allowing it.
>Since the kikes were the biggest donors to the colleges, like to Harvard. People like Ken Griffen said he was going to withhold millions from Harvard and never donate again (I think he gave $50M so far, but I can't remember it well)

Enough colleges saw they were going to lose all the jew donations, and hired jews to take the places of nogs and other minorities. Even getting congress to hold hearings for the jews over the some colleges

Hundreds of years of selective breeding which has given their Ashkenazi ruling class an average IQ of 115. So, the Kikes running their intelligence/defence institutes could well have Mensa level IQ.

Productive and proactive members of society will rapidly begin to drop out as opportunities are no longer available to them. They will be replaced by DEI stooges looking for a free ride, even at the expense of the nation. The formerly productive, and most importantly, brainwashed public will become either unwilling or unable to pay the exorbitant taxes that will be demanded from the elites, further hastening the collapse of the system. It will end with gang based shootouts in bread lines and soup kitchens while Israel collapses and the jews pivot to a Ukraine/Chinese alliance and start the game all over again.

...if it's 30 years outdated tech.
There is a brutal lack of entrepreneurial spirit over here.
Which results in bad infrastructure to start a company.
For example, I recently checked whether I want to make electric boats.
Every single supplier spent all the meeting time explaining why I shouldn't use their components, hull, drivetrain, batteries and so on.
I also asked US suppliers, they were all "sure, how many, and when".
So if I want to do it, I got to go to the States.

But the worst factor is this: Europeans bureaucrats were allowed to freely act out their mental disease for many decades now.
This had catastrophic consequences on life. For everything you want to do, you need a permit.
And the true taxes for entrepreneurs are beyond 80% in central Europe.
You can only lower it by getting gibs, but then you have to do as the bureaucrats want you to.
So a climate boiling DEI startup it is. Nothing else.

Be careful. Reign in your bureaucrats, or you will end up like Europe.

They don't have the mortgage-based Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads so unlike so many adults who feel concerned quietly, on the inside, they have more freedom to say that the Emperor has no clothes. And then make fun of it because naked lul.

Maybe if this ruleset had more integrity kids would respect it more but it doesn't and "because I'm older/bigger than you" stops working before adolescence and that's ultimately what that all decomposes to. HR's secular religion is Calvinball by and for the American professional managerial class and DEI's flock of grifters. Since nobody grows up idolizing HR then nobody's going to really want to respect that.

Hitting them in the money is effective,and costs us nothing. The last year of boycotting has resulted in some woke companies "scaling down" on their DEI commitments.

But how to know who is woke?Who to boycott?Which companies adhere to DEI agenda?

>It changed with PCs. Once the internet went from being for hobbyist nerds to something everyone had access to it became sociopathic pretty quickly
While I agree in spirit, the demarcation line was clearly the rollout of smartphones and social media. Twitter (X) is just a way to hook people into being online so to speak permanently. (((Elon))) says he wants to get people in the neural net. And, with Starlink, the idea is that there will be no way to avoid the waves of connectivity.

Personally, I think that this economy and complex systems vital to ZOG's domination will not survive ZOG's own policies (jeetification, loss of critical knowledge of systems [cf FOGBANK, the microprocessing crisis in the 1990s, etc.], DEI and giving the bulk of White men absolutely no sense of investment in the future, etc.)

So as the nearly 40 year old oldfag, my advice to you younger guys is to unZOG your life as much as possible. Save your money and think in a multidecade way. If you get into good shape and come to Mass genuinely, you will probably meet a decent young lady. It may take a couple of years though, so don't expect it to happen all at once.

So there is this massive pressure from the neocohens and the resistance to it is just the few remaining competent white guys from the Pentagon who are about to get replaced by jews or DEI niggers in the future.

While you are probably correct in this case. Not saying I would know , maybe I don't, but maybe I do. You'd be surprised at how bad some of the safe houses are and front companies in terms of being hidden. maybe 40 years ago when the gov was majority Caucasian, but it's so inept that even the CIA is filled with low IQ dei hires. Just look at the Secret Service, the once Unshakeable elite to the core agency turned out to be worse that rental cops. So while you are probably correct, the CIA is just as lame now as the SS, FBI, and State department as a whole. I'm looking at you 7th-floor fags. F your fancy stupid private elevator or so I hear..

I'm not saying they are good at it, but they mostly tried to push this shit while media was growing at an insane rate, no matter what you put in. As long as the marketing was big enough they kept making money. They hired consultants and were successful for a time, because their core audience was being replaced by new people constantly. Now that money is tight and people are getting progressively more annoyed by the culture war shit they should've already established a new core audience. It didn't happen though. Turns out the metric they were using to measure success was social media impressions. You shitposting on twitter? More impressions indicating their theoretical success. Turns out they were wrong, but the consultants build a history of falsely coupling their DEI garbage to success, so companies need maybe a year or two of failure until they start questioning why the old models no longer predict success accurately.

While there is truth in this statement you have to assess the authenticity of the "diversity" each time it's invoked. While you might be personally fine with this example of it being done "right" but collectively these efforts are being pushed the marxist agenda to decentralised white representation in media, there will be no more good white groups.

This would hold merit if the alternative wasn't staring at the TV. I know it's easy to be black pilled, but during the "heckin based" 90s your parents watched Reginald Denny get beat to shit by nigs. They watched a mother get executed for no reason at Ruby Ridge. They watched children burn alive at Waco. They watched and then they turned on niggerball or some show or movie filled with niggers and nobody mentioned an equivalent to DEI. Nobody questioned 9/11 and certainly nobody questioned the Holocaust. They did nothing. They sat and watched while the world they grew up in disappeared.

Look at us now. Mainstream entities are questioning Zionism, also talk of deportations. All of their propaganda has lost its edge because someone from here can immediately tear it down. Censorship is screenshot and kept forever.

The actual truth is that they've lost some control somewhere around 2013 and while they've accrued some back, they're strictly reacting more than scheming. There's a lot of chaos and shutting us down probably gives them some anxiety about the unknown. We live in a surveillance police state, it's hard to organize, however their hubris related to mass immigration and welfare breeding of brown people and then educating them all to be gay victims has backfired. There's really no fixing the system, it's easier to watch it collapse.

It's good to be rich, but not rich enough to be extremely noticeable.
What's the point of being one of the richest men on Earth when you're constantly in the public eye, everything you say, every single word is overanalyzed so you can accidentally have people claiming you're racist or sexist and hurting your sales when you say something goofy like "I like fishing"
>Huh, what does he mean by that? It must be code for grooming underage girls! He's "fishing" for them on his platform!!1
Then you have a huge estate, with many people helping you control it for a hefty payment. You know they will do their best, because if you get richer, their pay becomes higher as well.
Constant telephones, daily briefings of how things are going and what to do, agents of globohomo telling you to be more tolerant and hire more DEI useless fucks
Can't leave the place you currently live in without armed security, either official or in plainclothes, as people would recognize you "Oh shit, are you Elon? Elon MUSK? Can I get a selfie with you?", people swarming you, making you unable to fucking move. There may always be some psychos among them asking you for money, since you're so rich.
You know that your every action is likely observed by CIA, trying to find material and confirm if you're making shady deals with Chinese or Russians in order to later use it against you in the form of a blackmail - you introduce our political guidelines in your business or we're going to "accidentally" leak confidential info and ruin your image, also taking the matter to the Court.
Then, you also have a metric fuckton of women being interested in "your personality", but you know they just want a piece of the money cake. Most of them are very intelligent psychopaths who excel in all kinds of manipulation. They will fuck you over the moment they see a weakness of any kind. You know you can basically never find love, at the most you can get a good girl servant for money.
Really, I wouldn't want to be Elon Musk.

Basically under biden we have entered a new era of a great depression. They wint even admit there was a recession and that was happening already when trump was in office, selling america piecemeal to israel and blackrock etc. If you were to work 60 gours today you could not afford what 20 hours of labor afforded in the great depression. Massive influx of immigrants, not enough jobs to go around and they prioritized niggers fags and spics for every job. Whites accounted for 6% of new employment under the 4 years of biden. If youre a boomer your good and entrenched and safe. But everyone genx and younger gets absolutely fucked by layoffs and restructuring and dei hiring.

We have it worse than the great depression and they wont say a thing. Most people are too easily distracred with netflix and social media. I know I have been before.

If they kill trump there will likely be alot of subversive attacks to follow they wont just kill the head they will kill everyone in the movement from his entourage and feds assigned to protect him to the lowly voter. If trump loses again the left will enact a totalitarian police state under harris.

So id wager about 100% chance of civil war if democrats stay in power. Regardless of their methods. The right however will roll over and die. Their aipac guys tell them to kill themself then they have no choice do they top kek.

What will the outcome be? Poloce and mikitary get overwhelmed immediately by armed citizens. Theyll try some mass gun confiscation and round ups, cops and national guard nasty gurls get shot. The police and military wont be able to function and theyll call in un peacekeepers and deputize the immigrants. The immigrants will flee when shit gets rough though, since theyre only here for an easy life and everything provided for free. Once theyre drafted or have to pay to stay theyll mysteriously vanish overnight. And the legal ones born here will all go on vacation and never return. They put their faith in immigrants and niggers that are selfish and have no loyalty to anyone but themselves. The government will run out of manpower and just start drone striking anything that moves in former red cities and states. Eventually theyll try to use a nuke and blow themselves up like retarded dei niggers.

Lastly, President Kennedy began to end the Vatican's hoax known as "the Cold War," the American CIA and Russian KGB having secretly worked together since World War II. He also began to end that Jesuit Inquisition in Vietnam, as its future highpoint would be "Operation Phoenix," the CIA mass-murder of 60,000 Vietnamese, "in cold blood" according to its Opus Dei Director, William E. Colby.

The President interfering with Rome's Holy Office of the Inquisition could not be tolerated! Millions of "infidel" Buddhists were to be exterminated, the Pope's International Drug Trade would explode, American patriotism and liberty would further be destroyed and Vietnam would be reunited under Ho Chi Minh— another communist military dictator loyal to the Pope— like Stalin, like Chairman Mao, like Castro, like George H. W. Bush and son. Waged under the guise of opposing the communist empire's "domino effect," Cardinal Spellman championed America's most disastrous conflict known as "Spelly's War" overseen by Spelly's General, the Roman Catholic and CFR member, William C. Westmoreland. (Remember, according to Col. L. Fletcher Prouty in his JFK, the forced movement of over 660,000 Roman Catholics on U.S. Navy transport vessels from North Vietnam into South Vietnam was "one of the root causes of the Vietnam War." The arch-Catholic Secretary of the Navy responsible for implementing that Jesuit-agitation was the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Francis P. Matthews. Knight Matthew's Master was America's "Military Vicar," Francis Cardinal Spellman.

Mexicans (and Poos, and Niggers and even femiods) don't "take jobs" so much as they chase them away.

LA used to be world center for manufacture of electronics, shoes and clothing, aircraft, vehicles, ships, furniture, you name it. That is all gone and even "Hollywood" is leaving Hollywood, because even people that can afford armored limos and private armed guards for their gated homes don't want to live in gilded prison.

"Silicon Valley" firms used to be 100% White, with few Black janitors. Now its leaving Silicon Valley and the silicon is 99% gone and its just Jews running Poos (and femiods) policing "social media".

Yup, except when wages are shit why would I work for some retard who thing paying a whole $12 an hour with 0 training for a tig welder who has to bring in his own equipment and saftey gear.

How about you ask the HR sluts to go do it. I'll take the higher paying job elsewhere with a union.

It's incredibly frustrating to talk to a man who is incredibly intelligent in other aspects of his life, but who has basically not moved his political positions from the early 90s, refusing to understand why all of his children are the way we are. If you've got one kid saying "the situation is x" maybe he's full of shit or wrong or whatever, if all four of your children complain about DEI and discrimination in their fields, perhaps it really is a problem. Of course he's dismissive and says "you'll all be fine, you're all well educated with good resumes!" and he's right, we largely are all "fine" but we're all at lower points than we would have been if we'd been born even 10 years earlier.

I was redpilled (before I even knew what the term was) back in 2013 when I saw my hometown become pooified. I got sick of being told that myself and my ancestors are to blame for all the problems that blacks, latinos, and others dealt with even though my ethnic group were subjugated by Russians and Austrians (Czech and Polish ancestry). I'm sick of DEI hires and Bible-thumping neocons. I just care about controlling illegal immigration, ensure the economy still has opportunities for actual Americans that will contribute, and not worry if my car will be broken into.

That's what I don't understand. My dad did complain about DEI hires from women constantly skipping shifts to migrants doing a dangerous job when they didn't even know how to use a goddamn screwdriver. I thought it was at least safe to vent a little bit about being unable to get hired because of diversity law bullshit only to get talked down to like everything else I vent about in my life.

And yeah, he is really gen X. Loves telling stories of how racist and evil whites are and is also reluctantly supporting Trump because of grocery bills because even he recognized the change.

I'm a forgiving person, but if you commit the same sins over and over again I can no longer forgive that.

Imagine having every woman Charlie’s angle up to the point of being ceo of every major company (won’t happen see Elizabeth Holmes.

My dad has four working age children and we all vote Republican, he always whined about how we all became "nazis" and blamed shit like video games. Anyway he is a high level consultant who can no longer get work with the feds because he's white and male, now that it's impacting him suddenly we need to stop DEI and he's talking about how he's "reluctantly" voting Trump because a chunk of his income has dried up under Biden/Harris, and his buddies are in largely the same boat. It's like we've been telling him for years that there was a flood and he didn't care when the water was over our heads, now that it's lapping at his toes he wants action.

There is nothing more repugnant than a GenX or Boomer democrat, young people can be deceived or are just stupid, if you're a white person over 35 voting Democrat you're just a selfish and vile piece of shit.

I got a degree in computer science but without internships, an extensive portfolio of projects, and personal connections, it's impossible to get a good job. I just don't have that sort of autistic passion for coding so I never did much more than the bare minimum to get the degree. When I finally got a programming job it was with a bunch of pajeets and making 40,000 per year, which is a shi wage considering how much student debt I'm in.

That's the point, though, you are thinking in terms of groups. Why do we think it's important to consider groups rather than individuals.
The ultimate question I'm asking, I suppose, is whether "diversity" has any value in itself. I think it's an important question, since it underpins the entirety of DEI.

>it weakens white western nations.
They're pushing it in Japan now, too. For the same reasons. Diversity is official government policy now in Japan. DEI offices are in government, corporations and universities. Women Only jobs are commonly being advertised. Women without Ph.D degrees are being promoted to full professor over men who hold doctorates. Women are being hired for jobs who are not as qualified as the men who apply. As stated above, for every women hired, it means a man did not get the job and now cannot get married, have children and start a family. It's all by design. When the Japanese government says that it wants to raise the birthrate, they are lying.

Same, I wouldnt say I'm a "Chad" but I've had plenty of sex and relationships with women over the years but I've noticed that their behavior and the dating market has gotten so ridiculous over the last five years that I just don't even care anymore to put in the effort. I mean, it's unbelievable.

Between

1) them getting more money through either nefarious means or DEI quotas handing them high paying jobs they don't deserve in their early 20s
2) Online dating/social media allowing them to be insanely picky because their pool now literally includes the entire world and
3) Low IQ shitskin immigrants flooding in and hitting on them nonstop causing their SMV to go even higher

On top of it all, their behavior has just gotten worse and worse because they don't even have to put in effort anymore. And despite all these things, giving them unlimited opportunity/power, and lots of money, the marriage laws STILL screw over men LOL. The Jews in power still pretend like things are the same as the 50s. Anybody who'd get married nowadays is a complete moron

Look at Amazon's report about diversity in the workplace. Companies support this shit because it helps them basically do psychological warfare on unions and worker organization. It helps them devalue labor and communities and consolidate assets and market share. Notice how no studios have really filled the gap while Hollywood and the music industry churned out nothing but shit for 10+ years? It's because of OWS and tea party type populist movements, they scared the shit out of Fink and co.

The left wins because they are savage. They take what they want in reality by any means possible.

The right are turbo-cuckolds. They use language invented by the left like "incel" and push for women's right's (whatever the fuck that even means) because it's "the right thing to do" while those same women push for more funding for public schools and public propaganda to villianize those very same people who pushed for their rights in the first place.

The right is so concerned with having propriety of appearance they'll cuck themselves and each other in order to appear better to women, whom they know, deep down, are all turbo liberals.

The left makes shit up. They have no morals. They'll fuck their way to VP/President. They'll attempt assassinations on Presidents and any other public figure. Anyone who comes out against Boeing/DEI seems to die the next day. Anyone who ever spoke against the Clintons died the next day. Epstein's death needs no introduction.

And yet the right buys right into it. The right merely believes whatever the fuck the left believed 20 years ago. The right lets it happen. They speak in ebonics, they use dumb liberal insults like "incel" which come entirely from a liberal valueset and framework (i.e. what a loser, not able to appeal to women in a hyper-feminized cuckold inverted opposite dying society).

The left wins because they are savages unhindered by morals or values. They produce nothing and merely siphon off the system. The right loses because they are such fucking cowards, they are afraid of being called names or excluded. Even though they already are. They're fucking losers, and it sucks. The left destroys everything it touches. Even you.

Back then you were ADDING stuff to Windows to customize it around your needs, now you need to REMOVE shit from it before you go on to customize it around your needs. It's insane how they're pushing goyslop version of software on people.
I thought zoomers would be the most tech savvy generation, instead, due to dumbing down of software and devices, they are the most retarded, with zero knowledge about how things work and how to fix them. Of course, there is a minority that knows their stuff, but in no way can you compare them to the generation which gave us famous WAREZ crackers, multiple interesting viruses or people specializing in digital art, DAW electronic music and software makers etc - all those people were SELF-TAUGHT, back then there weren't a fuckton of degrees teaching these things (which are useless papers anyway). Only IT engineer degree matters, but even now, actual engineers aren't getting the jobs because companies poisoned by DEI would rather hire pajeets with fake degrees or with degrees that are worthless anyway, because their level of teaching is lower than knowledge of a kid in high school.

I agree. I get tired of it too, both on here and on X. While appreciate the push to maintain a strong, cohesive community with similar beliefs and values, the same rhetoric cannot be used to spread the truth. We need to lay the seeds of doubt in people so that when the kikes play their hands too far, they will think back to the video of yours they watched, and have a sudden epiphany.
People don't understand that you can't force people to accept what you're saying as truth. The old saying, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink" is extremely apt here. They must assemble the pieces in their mind on their own and come to that realization themselves. Once they have crossed that event horizon, only then should you recommend stuff like Europa.
Of course, people saying that everything glows doesn't help. People don't understand how incompetent and comfy the feds are in their current position. They sit in big, fat comfy offices, pushing paperwork. When something comes up, they approach the problem the same way every time. The same SWAT tactics, the same gear, the same bureaucracy, the same methods, etc. They get accustomed to their work and slack off as DEI hires to make them increasingly incompetent. This is why they have had to resort to violence, like with BLM and Trump. It's the only way they can affect any real change anymore because they no longer have the skills and ingenuity to operate effectively. Sure, they might try to infiltrate you, but they are incredibly incompetent and probably think you are a bunch of hick-hillbilly racist Ku Klux Klan types. They stick out like a sore thumb around hardcore NatSoc types. This is why they are rushing things. They know their control is slipping, so they are applying pressure on a global scale to secure their power. It doesn't help that we just turn it back on them, like with AI and all the glorious marketing material we have milked from it.

I'd actually argue that the landscape is quite similar in that regard. There are many small business owners, bachelors, and media personalities who are certainly not alt-right or far right who are starting to call out the establishment as going too far with mass immigration, forever wars, trans issues, and DEI. It helps that the left is blatantly so anti-white that some moderate white liberals are starting to realize these people will always hate them no matter how egalitarian and progressive they try to be. I'm starting to see more moderates say things like "I don't agree with Trump, but the left is going too far"

1. Leadership. The alt-right has some intellectual-types and rhetoricians like Richard Spencer and Nick Fuentes, and YouTubers like Zoomer Historian / Pax Tube / WhatIfAltHist, etc but it doesn't have anyone experienced in leadership, military, government, etc. Compare that to Adolf Hitler and Oswald Mosley, both of whom had experience in the military and leading a political party.

2. They came too early. They could maybe get away with marching with tiki torches and chanting about white pride and nationalism after society collapses and people become desperate, but America was still too stable during Charlottesville so average people viewed them as completely insane. Many people who call themselves far right nowadays was a liberal, libertarian, or moderate conservative a few years ago and got radicalized by the lockdowns and DEI.

All the tards from tumblr have migrated to twitter and they constantly like to virtue signal. They especially like calling anime fans pedophiles. There are also issues with localization.

Yes, in case it wasn't clear from my post, I am voting for Trump. Not because I like Trump, but because the alternative this time around actually is that fucking bad that I think the timeline for collapse of this system would advance rapidly if Harris wins (or steals it like Biden did in 2020). I'm in my late 20s, I've worked (lol I'm a cuck) my ass off studying my entire life, got 3 STEM degrees, and have a research job that I enjoy, even though the economy sucks and I make way less than retarded "business" people with tits and DEI hires.

But fuck, all I've ever done is slave away, pay my taxes, and I don't want this country to break out into fucking civil war after all that. I'm not a very selfish person, but fuck it, my selfish vote goes for Trump because I think he can prolong our system longer than Harris. People who aren't voting this time (just voooote harder goy, I know I know) around or who vote for Harris are either retarded (same type of people who think a nuclear war is winnable) or are literal children or illegals who have no "buy-in" into the American system.

4chan endorses trump because he is offensive and unfiltered compared to the liberal media. Begin making memes associating trump with Pepe the frog. 4chan trolls the government into thinking drinking milk and the ok hand sign is racist and they label Pepe the frog a hate symbol. With 4chans help, Trump gets elected in 2016. Pretty sure 2015-2016 is when the culture war really ramped up. A bunch of conservative commentators and moderate progressives like Ben Shapiro, Milo yiannopoulos, Sargon of Akkad, the factual feminist, Jordan Peterson and more came into the spotlight. They were absolutely dunking on political correctness and identity politics. A clear example of the first big woke movie coming out in the same year was the new ghostbusters film. The trailer garnered the most dislikes in YouTube’s history among movie trailers. Queue a million flops and controversies since then.

GamerGate 2.0 has occurred in 2024 because cultural Marxism has deeply effected the private sector. Most AAA game developers are funded by Black Rock and have DEI departments which are meant to make everything they produce inclusive to the detriment of the gameplay and story.

Now you have millennials and zoomers claiming (x) was always woke. When in actuality the principles espoused were closer to classical European liberalism or Australian libertarianism.

But remember, everyone else is a "MINORITY"!

Seriously, both shitlibs and white conservatives have been psyop'd into using the term minority as synonymous with non-white. EVEN while whites are
A) already global minorities
B) fast becoming statistical minorities in their own countries
The insidiousness of this shit keeps me up at night sometimes.

For example, at my previous job, they had the usual DEI posters and workshops for social awareness and DEI shit, lots of talk of minorities. Then there was me, one of the only white people in the company branch. But if you looked at the company's career site, they proudly proclaimed to be a "equal opportunity employer with a mission to elevate blacks, Hispanics, indigenous people, etc" basically everyone who isn't white. This shit is maddening and I'm wondering why more whites aren't waking up to it. We, with the help of Jews, are letting the rest of the world's people to come into our countries, morally browbeat us into relinquishing our future to them on our own soil, and are then psyop'd into developing Stockholm Syndrome to support it. The West has gone nuts.

Too much effort.

Either it’s hard to find a good woman or it’s hard gettting a degree, getting a job, fighting to get hired in the middle of diversity quotas and DEI. I can tell you guys my ex got hired applying to a single job in 2015, while I had to apply to up to a thousand jobs. It’s soul crushing bc and demoralizing, we also had the exact same degree from the same school. Having your girl earn more than you while you are unemployed is also fucking rough and adds stress onto the relationship, which inevitably ends up in a breakup.

You will never make a successful marxist society. You have no trannies, you have no unifying homosexuality, you have no STDs. You are an capitalist zone twisted by the elite into a crude mockery of a Communist Nation.

All the comradery you get is two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back, real commies mock you. Marx & Engel would be disgusted and ashamed of you, your adopted black children will laugh at your illogical behaviour long after you're dead.

Young hipster men are utterly repulsed by you. Years of failed collective initiatives have allowed younger generations to sniff out fake communist hires with incredible efficiency. Even White people that seem “inclusive” look uncanny and unnatural to a Real Communist. Your inability to understand walls of text is a dead giveaway and even if you manage to get a communist to lay about alongside you, he’ll start quiet defection the second he gets a whiff of your capitialism, work ethic, and institutional preferential treatment.

You will never have a centralised economy. You wrench out manufactured DEI every 3 months and tell yourself growth is going to be infinite, but deep inside you feel the collapsing communist cohesion creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under it's unbearable weight.

Eventually it’ll be too much to bear - community gardens will accumulate, anti-trans sentiments will get out of control, drum circles will sputter, and your economic zone will balkanise. White boomers will break into your offices, elated and relieved that they can finally force you to buy food. They’ll start 'lemonade standing' in your communal office to make capital, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know another failed communist experiment was attempted there. Your commune will decay, turn back into dust, and all that will remain of your legacy are white-race abominations and unnecessary infrastructure projects.

This is your fate, this is what you chose, and there's no turning back

>In the biggest surprise of the weekend, conservative provocateur Matt Walsh‘s Am I Racist? opened in fourth place with an estimated $4.8 million from 1,517 locations, the top debut of 2024 so far for a doc and the third biggest since Disney’s nature film Bears a decade ago. Am I Racist? is doing big business in conservative markets in the South, Midwest and Mountain States.

>The Justin Folk-directed film, described as a “social experiment,” comes from Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing’s The Daily Wire and marks the company’s first theatrical launch for an in-house production with distribution handled by SDG Releasing.

>In the film, which is drawing comparisons to Borat in terms of its tactics, Walsh tricks his subjects by assuming the role of a DEI trainee who attends anti-racism workshops, crashes private intellectual dinner parties and conducts sit-down interviews with experts and everyday Americans alike on the topic of racism. The film also discloses the fees paid to certain experts, including Robin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism. In recent days, DiAngelo blasted Walsh and said she had donated her $15,000 fee to the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund.

>Walsh posted on X (formerly Twitter) Saturday that while the film boasts a 99 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, no “mainstream film critics” have reviewed his film. Elon Musk, owner of X, gave a shout out to Am I Racist? when retweeting Walsh: “That is an amazing audience score!”

They should stay out of peoples personal lives. No vax mandates, no anti or pro lgbt shit, no firearms or fireworks bans, so on. No DEI, no cultural marxism taught in schools etc;

The competency crisis is more a private sector thing. The government has less power to enforce DEI policies than corporations and many agencies aren't allowed to sponsor visas. The one struggle is that pay grades are typically lower, so they typically have to hire less experienced talent and have major turnover issues.

Its model T thinking where if they can scale up and mass produce it, it will drop in cost, but its only grown exponential with no signs of some drop.

Where does this money come from? Well investors. These investment groups are either cut and dry bottom line looking for profitable investments, which AI current makes NO profit, or they are the same anti-white agenda investors that funded BLM, and why every major corp and even the NFL went ultra-faggot woke, cuckkneeling, praising nigggers as they burn looted and murded dozens of people across all major cities.

Apple, Microsoft, Target, Amazon, all get money from these cuckinvestor groups pushing DEI or whatever new name they are using. If you dont suck nigger cock, you dont get the big money. Plain and simple. The big money is the requirement for AI right now. Big money, with no return, is a hard sell to fiscal conservatives.

He's not an organic producer, he started out in regular television.

the system realized it lost control of the media in 2010 and started pushing their artifical celebrities to invade online spaces rather than continue their careers in traditional media. Their background in traditional media as well as their connections and access to better tools allowed them to make higher quality content and slowly push out organic producers.

by 2016, government and big tech started actively digitally executing organic producers who did not align with them politically, and started promoting those that did. Had he been white, he would have never made it this far and would have been destroyed in the great purge of the late 2010s.

doctors were always middle class. it was a meme that they made good money, in reality everyone else has simply been making less while doctors stayed relatively the same. Healthcare is essential work, so its taken a long time for it to be slowly replaced with dei shitskins who will happily work for less. also people are more resistent to accepting lower class doctors. a cheap plastic chair from wallmart wont kill you, but a cheap doctor from bumfuckistan might, so the tolerance for bullshit from the public is different. As the rich boomers die off, doctors will now openly be replaced with garbage immigrants with fake degrees, and the healthcare system will transition to being nurse heavy rather than doctor heavy so you wont have anyone tocompare your shitskin doctor to.

If you thought previous generations of feminists were bad, wait until 50% of the female population are childless hags with no eggs, raised on feminist brainwashing, indoctrinated by the jew, and in positions of power (seniority + affirmative action/DEI).
Life is going to become a whole lot more miserable if we don’t head this problem off at the pass. The question is, how? I think simply asserting strength and openly telling women they’re too retarded to be in charge of their own affairs is the best method. Just talk to them like the taliban talks to its women. Women crave a strong backhand, and since they aren’t getting it they’re going nuts.

>It really makes you wonder what the fuck is going on in STEM departments of the creme de la creme US universities.
Zionist Jews are vastly over-represented at the faculty and admin staff at these places. With the DEI initiatives, it also allowed them to exclude white people (who they see as a threat) and have easier people that are easier control. That this lowers the standards, they don't care about so much, it's about having and retaining control.

All this got revealed when you saw protests for Palestine across campuses. The mask slipped. The DEI hires they put into places, even as presidents of some of these universities, weren't simping for the Israeli Jews (because they just see them as whites). See how quickly the useful idiots were all gotten rid of. How they decided they'd rather tone down the DEI stuff now, because they realised they were a liability to them.

Western universities got compromised decades ago. It's either Jews or Shabbos goy that repeat Marx. There is very little in the way of academic freedom. Even if people want to be left wing, socialist intellectuals, they still have to stay with a frame of being 100% kosher (in Marxist or Leninist kind of ideas) or they will find there is no funding opportunities for them.

> Agreed! We need more niggers!
> Based! Ya let's bring in more niggers every day but only based and redpilled ones!

While it is useful to expose dei as the obvious nigger grift that it is, that doesn't mean niggers are good, or that we should still continue negrofying ourselves (even with the 'good' niggers). Even if the movie is amusing for their treatment of the insane leftists, it still doesnt address the real problem, that all niggers have got to go. Any right wing white people that believe that the negroficiation of white countries is fine are just as lost as the leftists are.

*gives your hand a gentle squeeze*
Anon-senpai, if you're going to make the argument that the officials on the ground are eschewing telling the truth despite it being, politically speaking, in their best interests, you're going have to explain why.
To reiterate, the:
* Springfield Mayor
* Springfield City Manager
* Springfield PD
* Governor of Ohio
Have all come out and said these stories are unsubstantiated. All of these officials are Republicans or otherwise would be incentivized to back these claims. You're telling me the Springfield PD wouldn't be itching to back this? It's basically a free excuse for a budget increase.
To be clear, Springfield is in Clark County, which voted 60% for DJT in 2020. This isn't commiefornia we're talking about, this is MAGA territory.
If the narrative is true - that the radical woke DEI (Didn't Earn It!) Replacist Biden-Harris administration is busing 20K Haitian niggers who are a burden to the city's economy, infrastructure, and are sucking up jobs and welfare and EATING pets - then these are the people you would expect to be screaming that from the rooftops.
But they're not. Interesting.
If you can explain why without resorting to (((mirthful businessmen))) that would be nice, thanks.

Are you implying that I own land? Last time I've checked, Blackrock, Vanguard Group, Opus Dei and Jesuits own all the land everywhere. The feds merely allow us peasants to rent land for a while, as long as we pay property tax, but they can use eminent domain to remove anyone from the land and give it back to the corporations whenever they want. I own only my own body and willpower. They keep trying to break or steal those too. Why fight for a system that demanda tribute for everything and impose licensing for rights that the Creator gave me for free? This system offers me nothing that I can't get by myself if they get out of the way and it only creates bureaucratic bullshit to make life harder, feeding a parasitical middlemen class of money changers, rent seekers and tribute collectors.

Oda is a freemason and his work is filled with predictive programing.
There's a reason why there are so much trannies in the anime (the Okama) and why they're on the side of the protagonists. There's a reason why most female characters that belong the the main crew or are associated with the heroes dress like only-fans whores (Nami, Robin, Lola, Vivi). There's a reason why the group that is supposed to counted the world Government, the Revolutionaries, are filled with BDSM freaks and trannies. Yonko crews are filled with DEI abominations as well.

So all straight, well dressed, dignified white men are relegated to Akainu's crew. Akainu and the Marines are meant to repent order, civilization, the patriarchy, the 3rd Reich, Rome.

Luffy's goal is to defeat this evil "nazi partiarchy" so him and his tranny friends can enjoy a world of absolute freedom (absolute degeneracy), and where all races can be equal. The core message of the manga is extremely left leaning.

1. Tell everybody that Jews started and wanted this war
2. Jews get run out of town.
3. With no Jews in town to give orders, no Goyim in town will be rounded up
4. Many towns in a state start doing this
5. With no Jewish influence in the state, no Goyim in that state will be rounded up
6. Repeat to national level

How will that be accomplished, you ask? Simple. Everybody knows what Jews look like and where their neighborhoods are. Every ethnicity - Black, White, Asian, Muslim - has some kind of grievance against Jews:

Blacks: Are well aware of Jewish exploitation, most recently with Jews removing all the DEI staff for wandering off the plantation with support of Palestine

Asians(Orientals other than Chinese): Starting to see complications of vax, attacked as "privileged" during woke era and denied slots in colleges due to Jews labeling them privileged. Also, Jews stole Asian month and changed it to Jew month. No, seriously.

Muslims and Whites - self-explanatory.

>Meritocracy
The classical liberal, open society type of country has traditionally done well because they've mostly been ethnically homogeneous (i.e. the West from the 1800s - 1950s). They also have a focus on the rugged individual, on "colorblindness" and of hiring the best person for the job regardless of which group that person belongs to. We already see the DEI movement eroding individual meritocracy. We no longer live in a country or in a world where the best job applicant always gets the job. We live in a world where the best applicant belonging to the right group gets the job.

What's more, as multiculturalism gets worse in intensity we can expect more tribal HR workers hiring more of their own kind, promoting more of their own kind and leaving all the colorblind, individualists as second class citizens who don't have a support network or a proper voice. See pic related, but imagine people of X race or religion instead of "nice guys".

>Democratic integrity
Trump got a lot of Southern redneck votes - not because his policies would help them, but because his message resonated with people of their race and culture. Similarly, Obama was not just a young, dynamic candidate promising reforms. Obama was not just the "hope and change" candidate. Obama was also the presidential candidate who was guaranteed a large chunk of the African American vote purely on racial grounds.

Democracy is supposed to be a contest of ideas, but in a truly "Open" society that lets in the rest of the developing world, Democracy becomes in part an ethnic headcount.

>Free speech
Free speech is being eroded by multiculturalism, brought about by "open societies" with open borders and free trade

The "meritocracy" has been fully compromised by things like DEI and Affirmative Action. It's very clear things like Secret Service director was a patronage position. The meritocracy has been subverted and any system you devise will be subverted by the radicals. None of this has anything to do with aristocracy, monarchy, communism, or fascism. It's all clear cut American politics.

Now there's nothing left of my town. The local culture is gone, we used to have all kinds of events and holiday events, local customs, and fairs and all that's gone now. The local culture has been replaced with like DEI art exhibits, and now the transplants have elected a street shitter mayor. The only local people left are the very rare boomer.

Haitians are eating cats, driving into poles, and the economy is shit. Nobody, including spics, are having children. More than half of the people under the age of 20 have had sex, or a relationship. Women open their cooze to dirty men on the internet. The nations IQ is dropping. Jobs are leaving. Boeing planes are falling out of the sky because of DEI. Sounds fantastic.

Watch a video from the 1950s, none of that shit happened. The 1950s had the lowest crime rate, the highest happiness, development, and GDP index in the history of the country. For all races.

Medium income - ish for here.
But first answer the same US interview question that trips us up when we see it. Your race as per DEI?

Anyway, you will be a renter if you do not have some 50k buy some housing, rural or about 70 to 100k for city shit. You won't get credit without proper verifiable income and that neetbux is not something I think will be acceptable.

This means that from the get go depending on place you will pay 200 to 400 for rent. Still a bit about better than the lower bound wages and into the low to mid ones at the current exchange rate.

Yeah, we are now in the rich country club at the very limit. Polska and czechian is similar I think and I expect the other counties sans Ukraine to follow suit in a decade or so depending on how retarded their politicians are on economy (read how much they manage to fuck it up - afteral, we got to this point despite political leadership not because of it.)

I live in the the most right wing town in America, Trumpville (We changed our name to celebrate Trump's 2016 win) Nobody has ever voted for a Democrat in our town since its founding in 1828. In the 1944 presidential elections, "FDR's polio" won the popular vote, Hitler came in 2nd and Dewey in 3rd. When came back from a tour with the Army (Russian of coarse, I ain't serving in no DEI US Army) I was shocked to see Harris-Waltz signs in every yard. I asked my Dad, George Lincoln Rockwell III what happened. Now my dad's no namby pamby liberal, He works 18 hours in a coal mine and comes home to beat his wife every night. On his weekends if he's not at church he's out hunting baby seals with his whomping club. He said son, ever since Kamala took control, the economy has been fixed, we've not had a war and everything just runs right. Then the town mayor, Adolf Pinoche Babykiller popped by to let me know that he didn't leave the Republican party, it left him, Trump and plan 2025 were just too darn radical, JD Vance was Weird and January 6th was in fact both an insurrection and worse than 9/11. Then Donald Trump himself appeared and let me know even he was hoing to vote for Harris because she earned it and was a better choice and he would drop out but that "he legally still has to run" Then we all did Republican things together like saying the N word and guns. So if you are a Republican you should just stay home this year. If Trump can't even win his own vote we already lost

Republicans created the Civil Service (Deep State) in the late 1800s. It was set up as a meritocracy mostly as a means to stop the Radicals among them from appointing nigs to government positions. Funny, 100 years later DEI corrupts the Civil Service into exactly what it was trying to stop. Americas politics has been nearly exactly the same thing since after the Civil War.

It seems it even got cancelled from /tv/. They obviously fear it even though Matt Walsh is far more benign compared to us, let's hope the Barbra Streisand effect comes into play here.

We need to make it widespread knowledge that DEI is essentially an enormous scam. We need everyone to know that ethnic coworker is working with these people to plagiarize your work and get hired and promoted over better qualified people. Most ethnic minorities hate you and are willing to do things like this, they lack western notions of morality and fairness.

The whole diversity thing was a mistake on their part, they should have stuck with liberal individualism meme a little longer, at least until white people are completely powerless and outnumbered in their own countries. However they got too cocky, they couldn't help themselves.

Google uses DEI AI filtering. So all the things that used to pop up on keywords is filtered into clusters of non controversial groups, where the pages and info are so similar and watered down.

They are guilty of going with trends. Hand made pages used to pop up. Then mostly it was geared to Blogs with rss. But with SEO, results were gamified and spam filled. They deranked it. Now it is filled with clusters of “facts” cobbled together by AI. That will be biased toward authoritarian news sources and junk posts on social media, but filtered not to offend anyone. So it no longer is a great index of anything in particular unless you can force it. I believe they stopped letting you search file directories and other things like this. So it’s not very good at anything anymore.

It is the whole Babylonian system that we live in that does these things, the whore and the beast on which the whore rides (the body politics of the western nations). Revelation 12:15-17.
The Roman church, but also her controlled op "Protestant" daughters that run with Roman catholic doctrines such as Futurism, The Antichrist™ (invented by Francisco Ribera), and Zionist doctrines (Revelation 3:9). A soft approach to Roman Catholicism. They are in ignorance of the true understanding of the Reformation that the Papacy is the whore of Babylon. No man can take the glory from Jesus Christ on himself. The leading man of the papal dynasty claims to be the representative of the son of God, Vicarivs Filii Dei, the Roman numerals of that name add up to 666. Billions have worshipped this Pontifex Maximus (a title of Pagan Roman emperors), he sits on the throne of the dragon (Pagan Rome), and tens of millions of Christians were murdered in history for their testimony of Jesus Christ. For example, if you denied what they call the real presence at their Roman Catholic Eucharist, you were burned alive. You were also burned if you translated the Bible, or even owned a strip of translation of it. That is the "gold tried in the fire", that's why we have a Bible in our hands today, and very little remembrance is given to those martyrs by Protestants today, they don't know their own church history. That was great tribulation, not "THE great tribulation", just great tribulation, Christians have been in tribulation throughout all of the development of Christendom.
Everything that people say The Antichrist™ is going to be/do, the Papal Roman system already fulfilled.
And now this Papal system says;
>I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

They've been staving off essentially the entire world who is funding and supplying Ukraine thru NATO with scant support and allies.
I don't think any country, even the 'mighty' U.S.A. could do the same with their DEI LGBTQ regiments. This conflict has been coming to a head for years and the west is acting like a psychopath with a victimhood mentality.
We could say that Russia deserves this for the Cuban missile crisis, but that would be admitting that Russia likewise has the right to defend itself from NATO faggots parking missiles and such pointed at them from their doorstep.
Without foreign interference the Slavs would have shaken this out after a few months and the body count would be significantly lower. Instead we're left with sending waves and waves of young men on both sides to die for intangible and indefinable ideals because we can't see past the football field mentality of "This side home team, it good! That side out of town, it bad!" As we in the crowd watch millionaires attempt to transport an empty leather pouch from one field to the left despite the fact that none of the players are from their respective territories and do not truly represent them, and therefore represent only the all mighty dollar and not the people they supposedly champion.

Also forgot to mention the dillemma of DEI is that jews considered the desired product of DEI as a "diverese society" being a better protective environment for jews, not to mention their status as the "ultimate victim", as leverage for all time withing their victim hierarchy

But now as things went sideways as their woke subjects turned against master, ergo the wokese consider jews as " privileged whites" which is obviously unintented conseuwnce of lambasting whitey. Jews now consider scrapping DEI or reinventing it for a more "jew inclusive" version...

I suppose jews can always appeal to Christians to once more do Zion's bidding, by pretending to drop DEI and woke, because jews are Gods chosenites, etgo the Christian kryptonite.

I quit my job because i heard of the pandemic benefits. The mask shit? I made planet fitness change their website because it didnt say "must wear mask while working out" but the gen z commie workers were like you have to. I embarrased them then they harrassed me. So i got them all fired by baiting the tranny worker into telling me they hated me. I called the DM, said I was being judged in a judge free zone. Next, at UPS, they had a 1 customer in store policy and i left the paper in the car and when i came back, a boomer cuck and his karen wife was in there.

Certain social outlook and the time it will take to at least compliment it with a better one means the plan has way too many openings.
Leftism will not lose its power until people figure out a better way of doing things. Most of the problems are self-inflicted when existing grievances and short comings in a cultural demographic invites these issues as social paradigm changes.
Holding people to account means people need to ease out from the backhanded plantation dynamics that creates the 'pull', and begin to hold degenerates fully accountable while moving past the holes left by previous paradigm.
Running things as they did in South Africa will result in South African reality. The current crop of woke DEI - black degenerates need to be culled out in order for this to work.

And now you know they got all that so they've moved on. They got their hatespeech, they got their faggot marriage, they got their DEI, they got their treaty. So now the next logical step for them is to "decolonize" Australia. They want Australia day gone, the flag gone, the anthem changed. The names of everything changed. All history erased to only paint whites as evil.
Then they want white genocide.
It's never enough for them. They get an inch, they take a mile.
I'm convinced the left will not stop until Australia is a smoldering ruin in the ground, there is no electricity and we are all starving to death eating bugs and it will be illegal to call the cops if you get robbed or killed by niggers.

Kamala's people most likely executed a soft coup on Biden, staging his "withdrawing from the race" by Twitter post as if Biden even fucking knows what Twitter is let alone would announce ending his political career on it.
At first she was thrilled, a strong powerful womynz of an indeterminate shade of brown, the perfect representative for the NEW face of America. It was her time.
Now the various people who actually control the levers of power have laid out their agenda for her, where she's set to be the dumb DEI hire scapegoat who lets them rape and steal whatever is left of the country's wealth before flying to their bunkers in New Zealand, and she's starting to wonder if maybe she should have just stayed in the coconut tree.

Since we're about to go war with Russia wouldn't it be crazy if some of the white American guys got together and realized

"You know what Russians aren't inflating my money, aren't bringing in shitskins to harass my sisters, aren't letting drug dealers and tweakers run wild, didn't torch my home town, and didn't lock me in my house for two years. Maybe I should take my anger out on the people responsible for that instead of dying in a ditch in Jewkraine while killing some Ivan who didn't do shit to me. I got no reason to be loyal to the US, no family and a shitty wagecuck job and worse standard of living than my parents, anyways so I have nothing to lose if zog falls."

If guys started thinking that way it would be terrible, because no one would fight for Ukraine or Israel. They might even fight against the incompetent behemoth that is zog. That would be bad since the US governments competent troops ran off to PMC's or left when Trump got out of office there's probably no one competent left in the US military. Hell, I know a girl who's a five foot tall turbo mutt and her sister who looks just like her is a Marine. Enough pissed off white boys with civil war guns could probably overthrow the DEI hires, imagine what they could do with AR-15's. That would be terrible. Just the worst possible thing that could happen.

I live in the the most right wing town in America, Trumpville (We changed our name to celebrate Trump's 2016 win) Nobody has ever voted for a Democrat in our town since its founding in 1828. In the 1944 presidential elections, "FDR's polio" won the popular vote, Hitler came in 2nd and Dewey in 3rd. When came back from a tour with the Army (Russian of coarse, I ain't serving in no DEI US Army) I was shocked to see Harris-Waltz signs in every yard. I asked my Dad, George Lincoln Rockwell III what happened. Now my dad's no namby pamby liberal, He works 18 hours in a coal mine and comes home to beat his wife every night. On his weekends if he's not at church he's out hunting baby seals with his whomping club. He said son, ever since Kamala took control, the economy has been fixed, we've not had a war and everything just runs right. Then the town mayor, Adolf Pinoche Babykiller popped by to let me know that he didn't leave the Republican party, it left him, Trump and plan 2025 were just too darn radical, JD Vance was Weird and January 6th was in fact both an insurrection and worse than 9/11. Then Donald Trump himself appeared and let me know even he was going to vote for Harris because she earned it and was a better choice and he would drop out but that "he legally still has to run" Then we all did Republican things together like saying the N word and guns. So if you are a Republican you should just stay home this year. If Trump can't even win his own vote we already lost

It's literally just a Pottery Barn forced design style. A jewish woman was the head of design but I believe they fired her for this shit because there are tons of job posts for manager of design online for the past 2 months. Every white woman was doing this god ugly commie block style. No color for communism. But what happened is the style was so cheap and unoriginal and it was exposed that William Sonoma was outsourcing their furniture build to China for Pottery Barn that their sales plummeted for everything except their couches that were still made in America and still had good quality. There for a minute, people were comparing Pottery Barn items to the same quality as Ashley Furniture but triple the price. On top of that, they pushed DEI shit in their shipping and customers were pissed off because niggers were delivering their high dollar items all fucked up. I know all this because my sister and my mom are major Pottery Barn groupies. My mom went with the latest white, grey, light wood theme until I kept teasing her for her home looking like a prison.

Burton is referencing Lucian, a satirist from antiquity, who mocks Jupiter's susceptibility to love. The phrase "ludus amoris tu es" can be translated as "you are the plaything of love," highlighting the uncontrollable nature of love, even over the most powerful beings.

Burton emphasizes that no creature—human, divine, or otherwise—can escape the influence of love. He quotes Ovid to demonstrate this universality:

>"Imperat Cupido etiam diis pro arbitrio, et ipsum arcere ne armipotens potest Jupiter."
(p. 51).

This translates to, "Cupid rules even the gods at his will, and even Jupiter, armed with power, cannot resist him."
```
=Love's Influence in the Supernatural Realm=
Burton further expands the scope of love's power by discussing its influence in the supernatural realm. He explores the notion of incubi and succubi—male and female demons believed to engage in sexual relations with humans. He draws from theological authorities, including St. Augustine and Jacobus Sprenger, to support his argument that such phenomena are real:
>"Austin, lib. 15. de civit. Dei. doth acknowledge it: Erastus de Lamiis, Jacobus Sprenger and his colleagues, &c."
(p. 53).

Burton then examines how beauty and grace are intertwined, confounding judgment and strongly alluring the soul. He argues that beauty and grace are like the beams of the sun, diverse in their effects but universally pleasing:

>"Beauty and grace are like those beams and shinings that come from the glorious and divine sun, which are diverse, as they proceed from the diverse objects, to please and affect our several senses."

This comparison to sunlight emphasizes the pervasive and universal appeal of beauty and grace, which enchant the soul and draw it toward the object of love.

Burton acknowledges that love can take many forms, depending on its objects. He references St. Dionysius and other Church Fathers who wrote extensively on divine love (De amore Dei), contrasting it with love for created things:

>St. Dionysius: "De amore Dei" (On the Love of God).

He distinguishes between different kinds of beauty—beauty of the body, beauty of the soul, and beauty from virtue. Augustine refers to the latter as "formam martyrum" (the form of martyrs), which we perceive with the eyes of the mind:

>Augustine: "Formam martyrum, quam videmus oculis animi" (The form of martyrs, which we see with the eyes of our mind).

Augustine suggests that spiritual beauty, discernible only by the mind’s eye, evokes a profound love that can transcend physical attraction.

Burton then categorizes love into several types, such as the love of money (covetousness), the love of beauty (lust), and the love of virtue (friendship and goodwill). He notes that these various forms of love can be virtuous or vicious, depending on how they are directed and moderated.

it has nothing to do with "profit"

whether or not that 'sells' or is 'popular' or 'critically lauded' is irrelevant
simply delivering the shit-lib ideology is what matters
delvering shit-libbery = the KPI
and funding is secured SOLELY on the willingness to deliver the shit-lib KPI over any other value or offering

They raped all these people from different races, but because Jews would lose power if they didn't consider the mongrels Jews, they warped the laws so that the mongrels get priority if they can prove the lineage/rape history. That's what minorities are these days, and that is why the DEI bullshit is so pervasive in America and other countries; Because diarrhea has infected the ZOG countries.

Just asking around here because god forbid you even try to tiptoe around the subject anywhere else. But in the US (maybe most of the west) what are we expecting the outcome to be from DEI? I'll put it out there and say that I've been working in lab sciences for the past 15 years between hospitals, Labcorp, and state labs, pharma, and even dipping my toes into forensics. Where I live, the AA population is 8%. Female AA's are roughly 4%. They are massively underrepresented in STEM and probably about 0.5% of that cohort. In the last 5 years, I have yet to see anyone get promoted to much of anything other than black women. Management, supervisors, technical specialists, doesn't matter. A very small amount of them are capable or even average. The majority of them are borderline retarded. Working in a chemical reagent production facility for example, our technical supervisor was out for a week because she was in the hospital for attempting to clean her clogged toilet with bleach, and then when that didn't work, she added a a container of drain cleaner. I've heard similar stories from people I know in other STEM fields. I worked in a clinical lab where the manager couldn't even fill out a premade chart, which she was advised on by the staff multiple times, and couldn't even do basic arithmetic, for coagulation testing. Leading to massively incorrect results for people on blood thinner therapy. And this was covered up and ignored by administration. Can't really do anything about that and report it, because guess what, the company holds all of the data records for the validation study and the comparative testing. I no longer have any faith in our institutions in the US. That bridge that I drive over every day? Probably some DEI hire that can't even use a tape measure probably signed off saying it was A Okay. FDA needs inspectors to check out Boar's Head factories? What the hell is a listeria? Mouthwash?

No, a Jobs program IS NOT UBI because you are IN THEORY paying to produce something. We are choosing the WORST possible Job program with DEI and NGOs because those things subtract value whereas you could in theory pay people to dig holes and fill them back up rather than fuck up things.
A real Jobs program wouldn't be DEI i.e. capped by race but open to everyone who wants to work i.e. not niggers. It would be designed to cover sectors that don't compete with the private sector and you could cap hours to create an incentive to always prefer private sector employment. We do the opposite by making public sector employment more attractive than private sector employ and are shocked to find out the economy sucks. It's not so much that a jobs program suck but rather the US Government sucks. Japan doesn't have this problem and all of their "welfare" programs are essentially workfare that function like being on probation i.e. considered shameful so nobody stays on "welfare" and it works because their system isn't run by complete retards with DEI.

? Education has been a huge issue for like 8 years or so. Just any time it's brought up they bitch about teachers not making money. Then conservative voters argue teachers should churn out better results then a raise is negotiable. Liberal voters argue pay the teachers more and it'll all get better because to them the curriculum is fine and working, but the underpaid teachers aren't given enough to truly care... at which point why are they a teacher to begin with?
Then if you bring up the curriculum, people argue we need to focus more on the Civil War and Holocaust but the rest is fine. Those two subjects were fucking 40% of my history classes and they want even more. CRT was a big issue in 2022, now they rebrand it as something less known but the same premise. Kind of like how people "quit caring about Affirmative Action" but in reality they just call it DEI now, people still gripe about it. Arguably even more.
This is also why charter schools are a popular topic here. Government calls them racist for thinking the community should raise its kids. A few liberal governors straight up told parents to quit caring about the school subject matter which enraged them to option charter schools.

I dunno how relevant it is to harken back to Soviet political commissars. In WW2 Stalin had just done a big purge and loyalty of army units was a legitimate concern given the recent history. The dual-command structure where every field decision required the commissars approval was disastrous, but they abandoned that sometime around Stalingrad I believe. The Soviet generals proved their mettle against the Wehrmacht once the Red Army got its shit together and had their hands untied.

The modern DEI and shittification of the US military seems to have a slightly, but distinctly different motivation: The US gvt is more concerned about a civilian insurrection than a military coup, it's not enough to indoctrinate the command, they need grunts that will pull the trigger on white Americans.

>This all works fine to suppress internal discontent so long as no outside power can seriously threaten you.
This is a very good point and speaks to the broader issue. The jews and traitors that run the west have been so preoccupied with internal threats, they've weakened their host to the point they're now vulnerable to external threats. These fucking psychos are dangerous, because the MAD doctrine goes from being a deterrent to perhaps an opportunity vaporize both the internal and external threats. It's a gamble, but they're running out of options.

In the 1944 presidential elections, "FDR's polio" won the popular vote, Hitler came in 2nd and Dewey in 3rd. When came back from a tour with the Army (Russian of coarse, I ain't serving in no DEI US Army) I was shocked to see Harris-Waltz signs in every yard. I asked my Dad, George Lincoln Rockwell III what happened. Now my dad's no namby pamby liberal, He works 18 hours in a coal mine and comes home to beat his wife every night. On his weekends if he's not at church he's out hunting baby seals with his whomping club. He said son, ever since Kamala took control, the economy has been fixed, we've not had a war and everything just runs right. Then the town mayor, Adolf Pinoche Babykiller popped by to let me know that he didn't leave the Republican party, it left him, Trump and plan 2025 were just too darn radical, JD Vance was Weird and January 6th was in fact both an insurrection and worse than 9/11. Then Donald Trump himself appeared and let me know even he was hoing to vote for Harris because she earned it and was a better choice and he would drop out but that "he legally still has to run" Then we all did Republican things together like saying the N word and guns. So if you are a Republican you should just stay home this year. If Trump can't even win his own vote we already lost.

Add (or remove??) a fucking stump so you stare at it wondering what the fuck it is and where the arm is. You wonder is it behind its back? Am I missing something? Completely drawing you away from the scissoring lesbians. First thing you learn is to have an interesting focal to draw the viewer in, and not to distract with unnecessary detail. Foregoing good design to insert as many DEI points as possible. Idiots could have included a hearing aid on the white lesbo, bionic arm, 6 toes, scar from having her kidney stolen by her uncle in 2004, fractured nose from being abused by her father (patriarchy sucks amirite??).

> The notion of ever needing to fight a serious war seems to have been abandoned.
Yes, the people running things feel secure enough to play games with their military. Look at how the communists in russia ran their military. It’s the same playbook (by the same people). Instead of political commissars, you have DEI commissars. Say or think anything amis, or fail to push the party line hard enough, and they report you and you get fired. So only the corrupt or true believers advance. This all works fine to suppress internal discontent so long as no outside power can seriously threaten you.
While the US may be militarily secure at home (for now), it’ll be undone by economic and social issues.

Don't listen to this faggot.

The best way to refute that is to say, you know how quickly those Palestinian protests got shut down on college campuses? It all happened at once, the DEI staff got fired, "donors" threatened to withhold donations and the protests were magically shut down.

These same colleges were for the past 5 years demonizing and attacking White Christians and non-Christians alike openly both in and out of the classroom. Where was that "donor class" who could have withheld donations then? Why were all those pro-America Zionist Jews like Robert Kraft doing nothing about the NFL and NBA kneeling for the anthem, cheering on the riots? White Christians were still openly pro-Israel and not a peep about them being attacked from any side of the Jewish community? No Wealthy Jews didn't use their influence to bring resistance of COVID vaccines and lockdowns to the mainstream, even though it was even at the time objectively wrong?

And that's how you tell them there are no good Jews, because "our Jews" were hiding out behind the curtain with the Bolshevik Jews, betting against America exactly like the Soros Jews did, beacuse they all knew that it would all benefit Jews and hurt Goys.

>Modern seals are not gonna be as good as the old guys were, western cucketry has consequences. Its been going on for a while, I read something about ww2 vets in vietnam being the most effective soldiers, even back then they didn't make them like they used to
To be honest, I actually think that the best soldiers in all armies are quite good.
It's men who accept a job where if they are bad at it, they die.

Consider the early part of the Ukraine war where SAS, larping as mercs or tourists, were very active in raiding Russian forces when they were over extended.
They are good soldiers.

Where I think the biggest difference is, is for the level of commitment overall as well as the support element and doctrine.
This is where I think the biggest difference is between Russia and the western armies lies.

Older generations had a purpose and strong nationalism/patriotism, same with Russians and even Ukrainians today.
You will not find this level of commitment in western armies (like blowing your brains out rather than getting captured, do suicide bombings when ammo runs out or you are too wounded to fight, headbutting FPV drones etc).
In the Russian and Ukrainian armies this is the norm.

However, I would pay attention to all units that force some DEI practices in the special forces (like Sweden does or did).
In those special forces the quality of tier 1 soldiers will collapse completely.

Pic rel, Major Eric Bonde fighting in Kongo, smoking a cigarette with two visible gunshot wounds from enemy 9mm. Still leading his soldiers.
His regiment, the Rangers, now does DEI hiring of women.

I don't think Marx was a jew himself, he was fighting his own ideology at the end of his life.
He knew he fucked up, that's why he looks constipaded on his famous pic, is not related at all of the half-dozen of his own children he let die for one reason or another.
If you read his poem is basically he seething on the christian deity. Kek. I even made a copy/pasta 2000 max characters on it.
He probably took the positivity more as a floating concept because his state theory is utterly dogshit, perfect for the kikes.
But no, he was responsible for the new-age marxism take, using race (among many other things) instead of classes.
It was actually the result of a title that I always recommend and is not discuss at all here despite every thread being related to it somehow, specially with DEI and tranny stuff.
Negative Dialects, it was written in Frankfurt in the 60's by commie kikes.
Instead of the confrontation between classes (doesn't work), they pitch every social contract being break and the confrontation of opress and oppressor in race, gender, friends, family, every social link you can think of.
And that's basically the state of the modern world, with the help of kikes and christkikes of course since most mindless commies and marxists don't even know about this book.
Marxism Negative Dialects.

After being in crypto for 4 years, I'd say 5% max. For fun. I've done pretty well but obviously late to the party. Getting about 12% ROI, overall, but super volatile. It's hasn't been a hedge against anything, either. It trades with the same hype the rest of the market does now.

I keep about 1-2% in silver, too. Been living off of investments instead of being a nigger's slave for a few years but most of it is from traditional investments, i.e. ETFs.

Game out every possible scenario, once you own a home and land, completely debt free... before quitting your job. Also keep job-maxxing for better pay as you go. I did it for as long as I could but the pandemic and DEI really moved my plan forward by about 5 years.

I'm just gonna have to sweat it out to make it without a job. That's with 800K in the bank, no debt, a farm-based business, and look I still want to work but I'm not working for or with niggers any more. Constantly saying "kill white people" and HR says they're a protected group and they're just playin' n sheeitt.

I've seen even very midwit white devs take the promotion carousel and get put in way higher positions than they could on merit alone, just because of how comparatively talented they are compared to the average jeet.

It sounds like we’re both coming from places of real concern for the future, even if we disagree on what would make things better. On voter ID, many Democrats support making voting more accessible and believe some ID laws can unfairly impact marginalized groups. On healthcare, many of us believe a more inclusive system is necessary because market-based solutions have left too many people behind. As for climate change, it’s about finding sustainable solutions for future generations, not about degrading quality of life.

What kind of crack are you smoking? You think Trump's presidency was more stable than Biden's? It was Trump who pumped like $7 trillion of borrowed money into the economy. It was under Trump that you saw constant BLM riots and other retardation.

Also, Trump wants to go to war with Iran. You think that won't drive up gas prices?

For that matter, gas prices were lower in 2015-2016 than in 2017-2019. They dropped during Covid and started going up prior to the Ukraine war.

Kamala is a retarded whore DEI/Affirmative-action candidate, but I'm sick and fucking tired of that kike Trump. Not only because he is a Jew, but also because of all the right-wingers who are sperging out like Trump is actually going to do something if he wins, or that Kamala winning is the end of the fucking world.

=Nichols' Profile Page and the MSU DEI Coddling Culture=
The alumni profile of Jamie Nichols, as preserved in the Wayback Machine, was a transparent attempt to paint him as the super-ultimate-mega reformed progressive ally, someone who embraced LGBTQ+ causes and women’s rights, evolving from his "strict Christian" upbringing. But beneath the surface, it’s clear that Nichols was more of a tool for the university to showcase its diversity credentials than a genuinely principled individual. His profile emphasized his involvement in student organizations that align with MSU’s ideological agenda rather than his competence as a future lawyer. It highlights the absence of true accountability at the institution.

Nichols’ tragic suicide in May 2020, after being charged with DUI, exposes the rot within MSU’s ideological grooming. His actions—both in life and in death—reflect the dangerous mentality nurtured in environments where moral posturing replaces personal growth, and ideological conformity is rewarded over true intellectual and emotional maturity.
```
>"I was raised in a strict Christian home, and I wasn’t exposed to any other ideology. I evolved my attitude toward LGBTQ rights. I saw that I wasn’t right."

This quote from Nichols’ MSU profile suggests that his change in views was driven by social and institutional pressure rather than any real personal revelation. The phrase "I wasn’t right" reeks of an ideological conversion that is more about appeasing the dominant narrative than genuine moral development. MSU applauds this shift, using it to bolster its own progressive credentials, while it leaves individuals like Nichols directionless and without a solid moral foundation. In moments of crisis—like his DUI arrests and subsequent career downfall—Nichols was ill-equipped to handle the consequences because he was conditioned to believe that simply holding the right views would absolve him of any wrongdoing.
```

At this point "better educated" just means you were processed though the indoctrination centers successfully. Universities started losing their prestige and value in the later 80's, and by now earning a degree automatically makes most people (including employers) suspect you're little more than a mid-wit ruined with crypto-Maoist brain washing.

Thanks to DEI and other anti-white and anti-Asian policies, some of the most legitimacy intelligent and promising individuals are shut out of the bigger named universities. This further devalues degrees from those institutions. Now the average "better educated" individual is an insufferable pink haired hyper feminist sporting a bull ring in her nose, a lazy and incompetent Indian, or a highly resentful black woman. All of them are not only much less likely to be as productive as the white and Asian guys that would normally be hired for that job, but are employment lawsuits waiting to happen.

The "better educated" are what has gotten us into this mess. They are the drones, the order followers, the good little cogs in the system, forever loyal to it, forever defending it, neve questioning it. They are the technocrats and would be technocrats, disconnected for every day life, and disdainful of the people outside their sphere, disdainful of the people they seek to rule over. They are the insufferable HR lady combined with spirit of pre-revolution French aristocrats, filtered through the lens of that movie Brazil.

Today's Western "better educated" class almost justifies Pol Pot's treatment of those he deemed too educated. They are living testament that intelligence and wisdom are two vastly different things, and that you can easily be an intelligent, well educated fool. They certainly disprove the notion that a +105 IQ equates to you being a good person.

Money begets money, aka nepotism, and jews are a HIGHLY ethnically nepotistic people. It's one of the reasons I have burning hatred of them, because they discourage and shame any inkling of group unity or nepotism among white ethnic peoples, while they themselves have taken over the upper echelons of our countries by practicing it. They're the ultimate "For thee but not for mee" people. Just like they were dead silent, or outright advocated, the DEI and anti-white sentiments that grew in our media and universities over the recent decades. But as soon as they came under fire from the same movement, they OH VEY'd and now DEI is being gutted or minimized in schools and businesses (at least at the surface level).

Fuck them, fuck them all to hell. I wouldn't care less if Israel got canceled from the face of the Earth.

I remember being forced to take a DEI class about immigration and it was an effeminate nip libtard who ranted about shit like yellow fever the whole time (unironically) and had a pretty thinly veiled hatred of whites. I just laughed, wrote generic lib propaganda and got out. Were I taking it today I probably would have called him out on shit as I have more of a backbone now but it’s so easy and predictable to give them what they want and simply get it out of the way. And the seethe towards whitey was funny

I used to be a blue pilled dude. I drank in the liberal bullshit and media that women are just as capable as men, don't be a sexist pig and all that jazz. All the women in my small podunk town were God-fearing salt-of-the-Earth. None of them were sluts, worked hard or studied useful degrees at uni, married good men and raised kids to be upstanding people. I thought that's what most women were like.

When I went to college in another state, holy shit, I got redpilled fast. I helped tutor this hot volleyball chick in my Calc class who was in danger of failing. She approached me at lunch, chatted me up, went to get coffee with her later, and we got to be friendly. She eventually disclosed that she was having serious trouble in Calc so for the remainder of the semester, she and I studied together (it helped me too because when teaching someone, it reinforces how well you know the material). She got a B+ on the final and there was a curve thankfully which helped boost her average score. Meanwhile she made lunch for me, we hung out in her dorm and smoked weed and watched horror movies (she loved 80's flicks), but never got to fuck her. Once exams were over, she completely ghosts me and stops hanging out with me. Luckily it was fall semester of my freshman year and I learned young.

Then of course when I went to the workforce, I realized how fucking useless women. Especially DEI hired managers and especially HR. So now I just keep my distance.

As a Goy who has worked for Jews, I know that this plan will not work simply because Jews do not elevate those who pose a threat to their dominance.

That's why it's always muds that they're trying to elevate. Did you see what happened to all those Black DEI muds who walked off the plantation and started supporting Palestine? Equity no longer favored them and out the door they went in exchange for more loyal Indians.

One must also note that the once-beloved-to-Jews Chinese are currently suffering the same fate for out-Jewing the Jew.

the steel industry has been going woke.
it has been pushed in with grants/loans all with a DEI clause. the whole bring manufacturing back bullshit is used to push this. EVERY ONE of those programs gives incentives to hire non-Whites and bonuses for foreign non-Whites. it can be anything from waiving regulatory fees to straight up paying the invaders wages.
combine this with worthless crackheads and semi functional alcoholics being the only ones that apply for poverty wage jobs.
three of the biggest employers in the steel industry in my area do this, because the non-Whites are not considered for their insurance. While every White that fails a piss test raises their insurance by 1-3% quarterly.

If they continuously get DEI incompetence as more and more of the working class basically self-militarizes.
Then the apparatus will fail, you can't control something like that, at best they lock down the cities they control and let the rest fall to barbarians and ACTUAL gangs they import by the millions.

homelessness and eventual drug abuse is the direct result of immigration and DEI hiring practices which discriminate against white canadians. This applies to every field and level of education. There are no opportunities for white people specifically men. There is a lot of space but there is no infrastructure in place which requires you to commute to the cities for work, which goes back to my first point about DEI.

The Rust programming language, however, goes through the following cycle:

1. Jewish trannies create ugly unusable language
2. Jewish trannies make a lot of inorganic noise praising the language, which is provably unsafe even with memory safety as its gimmick
3. Jewish trannies attempt to forcefully coerce major projects to inorganically adopt this hideous unusable language along with the Big DEI Push
4. When the DEI fad dies, Rust dies along with it, because nobody liked Jewish trannies to begin with
5. Jewish trannies literally die with the Rust language, and their other failed projects like Concord and Dustborn, by hanging themselves (pic related)
6. The tech community is once again guided by competent White people and Jewish trannies never ever get a foothold in anything cool again

The situation surrounding Project 2025 has recently come under heightened scrutiny, especially with the involvement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) and his association with Donald Trump. This project, developed by the Heritage Foundation, outlines an extensive conservative agenda that would significantly reshape the U.S. government if a Republican were to win the presidency in 2025.

The Heritage Foundation, a well-known conservative think tank, developed Project 2025, which is an extensive 900-page agenda outlining conservative priorities. The project, as described in the analysis, aims to fundamentally alter the structure of the federal government, including reclassifying federal workers under Schedule F, reversing abortion rights, and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The project’s radical agenda has garnered support from various conservative groups and politicians, including endorsements that emphasize dismantling the so-called "administrative state." However, the document's contents have also prompted strong reactions from Democrats, who have labeled it as "authoritarian" and warned of its potential to lead the country toward a "dystopic, right-wing theocracy."

It is Papal Rome, which started with ten basic kingdoms in Europe. That papal system had absolute control and dominance over Europe for about 1260 years. No one was able to make war against it, and no one could "buy or sell" without the approval of the papacy, they had the number of his name (vicarivs filii dei = 666) either in their forehead (their faith) or their right hand (being captive by the ecclesiastical and political circumstances), everyone had to do his bidding. No king or nation could go against the pope, because he would turn the people against that nation and that king very quickly. The pope was the king maker back in the days.
And the beast on which this whore rides today is the body politics of the western nations (ZOG).

While federal employment remained on a mostly flat or declining line, federal expenditures increased by about 20%.

We went from a logarithmic or linear growth in debt and spending to an exponential, bordering on quadratic, growth in debt and spending. Despite that, most Americans are somehow worse off. So it begs the question, where did the money go?

Do not expect them to allow Trump to play President. It's fake. There is no situation where they let him win as he should. They are obviously going a different route this time. Instead of claiming victory while everyone is asleep at 3am with fake ballots in the essential swing states, they're going to try to claim outright immediate blue wins in red states. When challenged, they'll say the difference is due to the immigrants who came in and change the voting demographics.

Federal elections are fake. Three elections watching Trump run have showed us how things really work.

Are you men enough to do anything about it? Or will you accept your new DEI mommy like the bitches you are?

Americans and Israelis underestimated the Chinese
Chinese out-Jewed the Jews
They teamed up to kill off Vine (made by Jews) for a more addictive follow up made by Chinks to supercharge degeneracy in America
But the Chinese pulled the red rug from under the kikes with 10/7 and then the Wukong game and now they have no alternative and DEI-obliterated infrastructure AND are normalizing Jew noticing in their country

Why didn't Trump go there. Is he retarded? During the debate, Kamala start rambling about muh racism and division. Why didn't Trump take the opportunity to counter by bringing up her party's racial grifting? Boomers and most normal Americans hate woke shit, but Kamala can't talk against it because she needs woke votes. He would have had her ass then and there. But no. He had to be a retard. FFS

Are ya'll aware the DNC has been using legal challenges to kick RFK off of ballots around the country in every single state? This is the "pro democracy" party? And Kamala Harris has THE GALL to get up on that stage and say that TRUMP has been race-baiting the country? After 30 fucking years of critical race theory bullshit and george floyd riots and accusing every single white kindergartener of being systemically evil and that their "whiteness" is a contract with actual satan, after 30 years of literally dividing people up by race and trying to judge them differently based on those immutable characteristics, when Tim Walz' home city of Minneapolis has a rule that the Teacher's Union MUST fire WHITE teachers before black teachers in the event of a layoff, after DEI programs resulted in only SIX PERCENT of the 300,000 top tech jobs added in 2020 going to white people, Kamala Harris has the balls to get up there and accuse Donald Trump of using race to divide the country. Because he called her a code-switcher when she literally has spent her entire campaign code switching.

I don't know who won the debate, but i'll say I hate Kamala Harris's guts so fucking much right now.

I live in the the most right wing town in America, Trumpville (We changed our name to celebrate Trump's 2016 win) Nobody has ever voted for a Democrat in our town since its founding in 1828. In the 1944 presidential elections, "FDR's polio" won the popular vote, Hitler came in 2nd and Dewey in 3rd. When came back from a tour with the Army (Russian of coarse, I ain't serving in no DEI US Army) I was shocked to see Harris-Waltz signs in every yard. I asked my Dad, George Lincoln Rockwell III what happened. Now my dad's no namby pamby liberal, He works 18 hours in a coal mine and comes home to beat his wife every night. On his weekends if he's not at church he's out hunting baby seals with his whomping club. He said son, ever since Kamala took control, the economy has been fixed, we've not had a war and everything just runs right. Then the town mayor, Adolf Pinoche Babykiller popped by to let me know that he didn't leave the Republican party, it left him, Trump and plan 2025 were just too darn radical, JD Vance was Weird and January 6th was in fact both an insurrection and worse than 9/11. Then Donald Trump himself appeared and let me know even he was hoing to vote for Harris because she earned it and was a better choice and he would drop out but that "he legally still has to run" Then we all did Republican things together like saying the N word and guns. So if you are a Republican you should just stay home this year. If Trump can't even win his own vote we already lost

The whole socialists analasis of employer vs employee dynamic fails to take in to account a third much larger class the customer. The customer constantly gets screwed over today in favour of (((large investment groups))) like blackrock and there agenda it seems to be just standard corpo practise for every dei esg bridge approved corpo.

My Much Superior Analasis
Leftists primary identity the worker: Leftists see themselves and others first and foremost as labour this is how they identify, how they group and the main thesis of their ideology that
A) Workers of the world unite
B) The workers should own the means of production
When working you will meet alot of people who are anti-customer, either due to percieved incompetence of the average customer interaction or simply having to put in the work of interacting in the first place, not always but alot of these people are to the left
Leftist companies but especially seem to embrace this anti customer attitude and become hostile to customers even attacking real or imagined haters as part of the advertising material.

Proposal
A Dictatorship of the Customer
The customer owns the means of production
Everything is made to the wants of the people who will pay for and use it, enough production to meet demand, anti customer practises outlawed, microtransactions and lootboxes illegal!
Everything good, and nobody starves unlike stinky leftist communism.
For fun I have attached an image of two angry customers shouting at a wagie.

Read Kevin macdonald’s books. His theory is that Northern European morality is centred on “moral communities” where people that transgress community morality are shunned and excluded. That makes europeans highly morally conformist. The problem is that when Jews came to power they understood this fact and blasted whites with propaganda that is moralistic in nature and whites are programmed genetically to follow moral appeals without critical thinking.

If Jews say that supporting DEI means you’re morally good and not racist - most whites will go along with it without thinking because they’re primed genetically to go along with moralistic sounding language.

I personally hate DEI and know that it’s a Jewish strategy to wreck white civilization but most whites don’t understand their own psychology and don’t know that they should think critically when people make moral appeals to them.

I did built my own little perfect quiet place, as I moved somewhere to the countryside, with farms and cows and deers and all, my wife peacefully homeschooling our young children with tons of nice non-degenerate books, art and music, playing games, reading, painting, drawing, or running in the wild all day while I was working hard providing for everyone. We were incredibly happy, kids were blatantly smarter, social and open-minded than any full time autistic public-schooled and TV-screened same age kids I ever knew. Until they came with a new law, crushing a right granted by the constitution for 100 years, that branded us enemies from the inside, treated us far worse than literal mass-murderers and terrorists, threatened to send me to jail, threatened to take our children so they can be offered to those organized pedorings they call "childhood social services", and forced us to send them 8 hours a day to those braindead camps where they sit all day learning nothing, getting bored 5 days a week, and getting beaten 10 vs 1 by DEI monkeys while grooming teachers are watching elsewhere on purpose, as the light of hope and happiness was disappearing in my kids's eyes.

It gives some time between a spacex possible victory and boeings terrible fuckups, improving optics for that DEI shitfest. It probably is viewed as providing leverage against X providing less censorship on AI tools and such (as is of concern in congress today - hardly an accident).

On the other hand is maybe, just maybe, incrementally advancing our species in this universe. But no. Getting Kamalla into office and giving political favors and shifting optics is more important.

It's very simple idea that if you live to get wealthy/maintain your wealth you aren't living for God.

It's not about being a "capitalist", it's about giving your life towards worldly systems. Social institutions like DEI stuff and academia, trying to impress the overlords means you aren't trying to impress God.

Typically a society is only going to reward those who serve it best.

Ironically as a "capitalist", you can engage in an honest type of work and still get rich. For example, as a carpenter.

>War. War everywhere. Nuclear war with Russia if we can get it to wipe out all you chuds we are trying to replace. Kamala will be in her luxury bunker getting foot massage while you and your kids vaporize.

James Earl Jones just died.
Voice of Vader, Lion King, great in Conan the Barbarian. Even enjoyed him and everyone in Coming to America an almost all black movie.

Now I can't stand all this black garbage. I don't want gays and blacks in medieval fantasy. Why is 13% in 80% of shows? Why can't fantasy elves be white and graceful and beautiful.
Why was 2000s lord of the rings good, and the new high budget show feels like unimmersive garbage?
Why did the witcher 3 videogame feel like regions had believable cultures and ethnicities, but the tv show was all blacks and jews with gay shit and the main character that held it all together was let go for trying to keep some semblance of the source material?

Why did call of duty remake the ww2 setting and you mainly play as black women?
The latest assassin's creed is a black samurai killing japs.
Half of tv anchors are black. Sportsball is mainly blacks.
Like we already have plenty, why are they being forced and injected into totaly inappropriate settings?

But we know why. It is part of the destruction of all white societies on earth. From europe to australia/nz, to canada and the usa. All have had swarms of migrants pushed by policy. And most that just so happen to be in control of setting those policies in banking, legislation, equity firms, tv, movies and games, are jewish. Don't follow thier dei policies and you can't get funding, insurance, or approval.

Everyone I know still worships pajeets and think they are the coolest people ever. I can't even bitch about how I an unemployed because the pajeets took all the jobs without my parents calling me racist and how we need DEI hiring to fight racism.

You don't really need 144hz for all the DEI strong and sassy negress MCs in GoyStation titles. 60hz should be fine.

It used to be the case that consoles had interesting hardware that developers could geek out to and have fun pushing the limitations of the hardware, like the old amiga demoscene spirit. Now publishers have figured out that nobody gives a shit about the technical wizardry some autist did that made certain console games magic in the first place, they made it easy to make games, and so everything is basically a PC with DirectX or Vulkan, and probably no hardware twiddling allowed anymore, and now any DEI pleb can throw something together in a week.

Your country literally pays businesses to hire new immigrants. Along with DEI policies, any country that fucks over it’s men doesn’t deserve to exist and there is no fitting end other than being raped to death by Indians.
