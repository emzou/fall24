>exposed and further radicalized the cocksucking right, awakening them to their cult of personality moralizing bullshit has nothing to do with politics, and the only reality of this world is who has power writes history, who hasn't endures it

This is not a dark day for Brazil at all. This is mere cause and effect.

1st-worlders, you only needed one goal to win, you should've known what it was coming after goal #4. We bankrupted ourselves, and this is how you treated us. So we hurt Israel, we hurt you where it hurts the most, the chosen people you care above everyone else.

We have turned heel, and the next big move will be a big 'fuck off' russian ICBM launch platform that will make the Cuban Missile Crisis look like a caribbean trip.

We are not your satrapy. We are not afraid of your grifters.

You will see that a son of BRVZIL doesn't miss a fight.

Anon, I’ve stated repeatedly in this thread that the US military is in far worse shape than the NATO cheerleaders will admit, and that our logistical train is damned near gone. We lost a whole lot of veteran soldiers over the mandated Covid vaccines, and experienced senior officers during the Obama purges. Our military-industrial complex that provides hardware and ammunition is full of DEI hires and jeets. The whole thing is a giant clusterfuck that it would take a solid 30 years to fix. Assuming it could be done at all at this point.
Again, NATO is a paper tiger propped up by the specter of the US military of the 90s. And it’s becoming painfully obvious to the rest of the world.
My concern is that the people running things are slowly realizing it as well, and they’ll decide to continue escalating to maintain the show of their relevance and power rather than letting it go.

Imagine how much of that could be relocated to space programs, not just in America, but all across Europe too, if we stopped pissing about welcoming in niggers and funding Jewish wars.

FACT: Jews are against space exploration because they
1. Lack the desire to explore and conquer which only whites and some asians posess
and
2. They lack the skill and workforce to be able to partake in it, which means white people dominate space exploration, which the Jews hate

This is why the Jews push anti-space conspiracy faggotry. All flat earthers and Moon landing deniers are either Jews or demoralised whites.

We need another leader like JFK. Someone who can reignite the white spirit. The Solar System exists for the best of us on Earth to explore and conquer, and the stars are our destiny laid out as our true test from God.

NASA is pathetic in its current state. We should've had landers and probes on every planet, moon and dwarf planet we know of by now. They're struggling to even get their Europa probe launched this year and they're stranding astronauts on the ISS by trusting DEI.

China is going to establish the first Lunar colony within the next decade, and with that, the second space race will be on. But who are they competing with? Artemis is a joke and no other nation has the white spirit to compete with chink autism. So what's the end goal here?

Wouldn't be so sure. A tiger never changes its stripes, but it can certainly change its behavior to appeal to the Trump base. There's also the very real and unfortunate possibility Trump is imprisoned or dead by '28 and the GOP successfully trick enough of his base to believe in a new figurehead.
>>480101017
I do agree, many of the polls are not high quality and using flawed methodologies. But so were many of the polls of '20 and Trump lost that election. If the election is as 'close' as it was in '20, we'll see nearly the same results with maybe a token GA flip back to R's to keep things quiet. There's a reason the good state-level pollsters have been quiet in many states since the Kamala exchange and most of the 'shock polls' are national level.
>>480101489
The problem is where that 1% comes from. Whites? White population continues to decline year over year, so their voter impact continues to decline at a rapid pace. The campaign has good policies for whites, but he isn't specifically speaking to them as he was in '16. The lip service is going to the fringe minority/union voters as it did in '20. Minorities? A foolish ploy with Kamala as the DEI candidate. Focus on white women? I think that's what he's trying now. Maybe a focus on college educated whites? Is that the play with the pro legal immigration rhetoric and policy proposals around visas, appeal to the centrists that want something to point to say 'see, he isn't racist, now I can vote him'.

I always thought these kind of things are jokes, but they are real.
I just learned some big gaming companies like Ubisoft pays Sweet Bay for consultancy in craps like DEI and ESG bullshit.

Yes, they literally huge amount of money to Sweet Baby a bunch of woke tards for making their games more diverse and inclusive, and make all the female characters into ugly dykes just to boost the EGS score.

Why the fuck do they do this? Paying money to make the games less appealing to the actual gamers, and instead, make the games more appealing to those 1% of the people who don't really play the games.

We need to stop this Sweet Baby company, we need to boycott any game that adopts DEI, ESG and all the non sense. We need to let them know, we do not need those craps in our games.

There's plenty of highly skilled engineers in US.
It's just the gov made it mandatory to hire niggers, browns, pajeets, women and other DEI / Affirmative Action retards.
Of course, none of the above are capable engineers.
Turn DEI requirement OFF , remove HR pajeets and women , and voila, many many new capable white male engineers are available.

Isn't critical race theory a social transformation program? (ie dedicated to revolutionary change?)

I don't hate the enlightenment and I'm not religious. There were various strands of the enlightenment. Some resulted in the U.S. constitution. Others in communism. Now we seem to be under some sort of "revolution" that is heavily funded with hidden objectives.

Defiance and independence are revolutionary today but only if you are against the regime. The regime fund critical race theory, dei, and all such other things. Their view of revolutionary change is dissolution of national identity and borders. The trajectory is towards global governance, ethics, and citizenship. These programs are supposed to create change toward this vision.

You are correct. The point of diversity and equity is that they are contradictions. With diversity you will get differential outcomes (not equity). With equity you can't have diversity. The tension never resolves. This way they can always strategically argue for more diversity or more equity. It's an infinite feedback loop that justifies more DEI. There is a reason every corporation, government, and NGO has DEI department. There is more to this than we realize.

The fedora gang may have been all white and the scummiest of the hobo gangs not even holding onto the shelters just harassing people for tent space. Can be considered as not wanting to make another mostly black gang not look bad when they start the riots, and the fedora gang takes over the unemployment office and takes hostages. Until you look at the scene of the rich snobs. The white guy is the only one sympathetic to the homeless. The DEI negress doesn't give a shit and the Asian man goes along with it because being antiwhite (or in this case anti homeless) is a way up for him in this Jewed system.

Then again, the white guy might just be trying to sleep with Dax because she was almost thrown into the homeless sanctuary for not having ID on her after getting mugged. And he likes chicks with tats. He has a sleeve under that shirt.

Now I'm old and I work in IT.
I get paid 20x than I did as a kid but I work 40 to 60 hours a week around DEI, Tranny's and Liberals.

If you look at Riotgames which started with modders who quit DOTA2, and that made league of legends and valorant and whatnot, as well as the character design from inception to right now, is that they never stopped pumping out hot female characters in super sexualised clothing while other gaming franchises (mass effect, last of us, etc) were actively making their characters hideous to appeal to DEI and ESG.
Riot became a major gaming industry with some of the largest fanbases, world championships, etc. and it came from a couple of modders. How did they achieve this? By listening to 30% of community complaints (as opposed to the 0% most game companies do) and never stopping the coom material

First of all, a message to the trigger happy mods on this board:

/v/ doesn't want anything political, even if it's videogame related. So I hope this is the right board for this thread.

ESG and DEI are welcomed by almost all larger developers today. This practically means a left wing feminist content control, but a lot of these companies are too dumb to understand that.

Could this lead to talent leak from larger companies? Artists, directors etc who grow tired of the constant content control will leave for smaller developers?

Because smaller developers don't really care. IGA and ArtPlay said they don't give a shit about current social or political trends. Dragami Games swore that Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will be uncensored. And the most "edgy" games today come from smaller developers who have not embraced ESG and DEI.

Could ESG and DEI mark the point when giants will fall, and smaller developers pick up their talent?

In reality the US went borderline Commie and that’s why the infrastructure is so bad. Soviets jailed all their Engineers, and replaced them with loyal comrades, because the engineers wouldn’t do stupid shit that wasn’t possible. The Soviets said they weren’t factoring in the socialist workers spirit in to the math equations that said the rail tracks couldn’t handle a 10 times increase in rail freight. When the trains inevitably crashed they blamed in on engineers and they were called wreckers and sent to gulags.

The US did the same thing, replacing competent engineers with DEI hires with Engineering certificates earned in 18 months at Phoenix academy.

They can pave roads and highways with paving materials that last like 30 winters without potholes. They cities can’t use it because the citiy workers unions refuse to let them. They put it in every contract, so the workers will have enough work. Workers Unions are also Socialist/Commie. I’m in a union, I don’t appose unions at all, but that shit is retarded.

She has the entire democrat party apparatus to help her. She has a team of people advising. An edited interview with a network and anchor who want her to win. This is the best she can do. I think she has some drug or booze problem. Maybe benzos. I think it really is just that she is low iq and stupid and coasted through life by being a whore and dei and is very incompetent. The pressure is starting to get to her. I understand why the democrats pulled Biden, but it put her in a tough position. Usually she would have been doing interviews in months prior and had more time to develop her agenda and vision and policy proposals to communicate to voters. Swapping her in makes everything so compressed that she missed out on doing all that and is scrambling. She would have to match Trump's schedule of daily events and long talks. But she is not mentally capable of that.

I don't think she does much better in some mock interview done with staff. This is her best and she's gotten away with that her whole life. Vague platitudes to placate people and some democrat voters eat it up

it's due to institutional racism that must be overcome with DEI, quotas, affirmative action, and punishing whitey.

Back in the day students were richer and high iq, it was a place to train people for more important jobs
For various reasons (DEI, cultural shifts, loans to scam the lower classes) the amount of poor or stupid people increased
Those are just there to party and get indoctrinated before they go flip burgers
A similar shift happened with schooling in general, high schools were more elite and you only went there if you were going to college

8. Having one indian running for office once is tough, agreed. You know whats worse? Nothing but indians running for office, all the time
9. Thats the price for freedom(tm)
10. To have servants means there need to be servants, i.e. unfree people. Celebrating that your own people are unfree is not the flex you might think it is. And on an individual level, there are probably enough millionaires and upwards who employ people as quasi-indentured servants.

In a color-blind society you can have soft segregation because the elimination of affirmative action and DEI would lead to urban areas and social activity being stratified by competence and agreeableness. Race-mixing would be greatly reduced and mostly limited within stratas. Blacks would mix with Arabs and Latins, Europeans with Asians - but the in-group bias for racial groups is very pronounced in all races, so race-mixing in general would mostly disappear.

Could the 'color-blind' project from the 80s and 90s have suceeded in terms of population pacification?
When you watch movies from that period it's pretty clear that ethics were geared towards judging individuals primarily by their actions - then in the 2000s and 2010s it shifted to an antagonistic mode where values are assigned by race only.

I wonder how far this social engineering experiment could have gone. The biological gap in competence and propensity for violence between Asians and Europeans on one side and the various Afro-Arab races on the other is substantial, but I can imagine a society which is both highly meritocratic and color-blind as considerably more peaceful than what we have today.
Just imagine if the US media propaganda machine, instead of blasting DEI Marxism and White Subservience for 20 years, had instead continued to erase and deny race, as well as exporting those notions through their imperialist structures. The whole world would look completely different today, probably better, despite the core principle being a lie.

A nuclear attack on Russia would be a profound tragedy due to its vast human, cultural, and global implications. Russia, with over 190 ethnic groups, is incredibly diverse. A nuclear strike would indiscriminately impact all these communities, including marginalized and minority groups who are already facing significant challenges. The loss of life and cultural heritage would be immense, erasing parts of the world’s rich cultural tapestry.

Furthermore, such an attack would severely undermine global efforts toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The destruction of any nation disrupts progress in addressing inequalities and promoting fairness, setting back DEI initiatives worldwide. The global community’s advancement toward a more equitable society would be hindered, as the devastation of one nation impacts the broader goal of inclusivity.

The moral and ethical implications of using nuclear weapons are stark. It reflects a failure of diplomacy and peaceful conflict resolution, escalating potential global instability and further conflict. The humanitarian and cultural costs of such an act would be enormous, highlighting the need for resolving international conflicts through dialogue and cooperation rather than through devastating violence.

I literally don't care either way
trying to shape public policy to favor your little tribe is for non-whites.
> but that was the MIT admissions data for 2025 (class of 2029). White enrollment is down 2% and less people would lie about being white (a huge proportion of students do).
this is such a quintessential leftist argument, I'm amazed you broke tradition by being honest about it.
It's dishonest, you tried to use the stat to argue that whites would somehow fare worse without AA, when in actuality it just means that 2% of whites were abusing AA to fraudulently get spots (which we would ALSO not support) and which undercuts the reason you raised.
AA was silently supplemented by DEI initiatives which used a bunch of indirect methods to achieve the same results, so again, you're comparing one version of race-based admissions to another version of race-based admissions. The DEI enrollment criteria JUST got removed from Harvard, so I would bet we haven't seen a 'clean' enrollment yet until this fall.
And then there's the issue of determining 'true' race. By your own admission these are people who claim to be non-whites on their application, on what basis did anyone figure out that they actually aren't white? I'm skeptical that occurred, if the school was going to do that they'd have done before enrollment to prevent the whites from gaming the system.
whats MUCH more likely, is retarded academics, totally up their ass with why we support getting rid of affirmative action, likely made the same retarded mistake you made, and thought that we didn't like AA because it didn't help whites, and therefore we wouldn't like the non-aa program (which again was actually just a dei-based program essentially identical to aa) because it doesn't benefit whites.
Nigger, WE DONT LIKE RACE BASED POLICIES BECAUSE THEY'RE WRONG. If whites earned less spots, we're 100% fine with that, we don't institute policy to help our tribe. We like meritocracy.

They are being "oppressed"; however, it is an innate "oppression" that is inflicted upon them by themselves, and the basic immutable realities of superiority and inferiority.
Nothing can be done about it externally--especially by whites since this only further fuels the inferiority complex--which is why DEI etc. is a fool's errand.

The people in charge of recruitment are still DEI and refuse whitey. The military cannot fire these people. In Australia recruitment is civilian so it's even worse. The militarily here cannot fire the DEI recruitment people.

I've heard cases of brazilians enforcing cancel culture (?), in a country where bloody murders of entire families are daily ocurrences and people are sat fire in car wheels as an execution ritual.

This has a single origin: Twitter spreading american DEI (Divide et Impera, also known as Diversity - Equality - Integration) culture. Brazil has far larger, real problems.

Not wrong. Big US corps also support all manner of environmental and DEI initiatives. Meanwhile, smaller US companies can't afford to build manufacturing plants in China, and they can't afford an entire DEI division. Thus, they get stuck trying to manufacture stuff in the United States, with the added expense of all manner of green regulation, and they don't get high diversity scores from BlackRock, because they can't afford Robin DiAngelo's corporate diversity trainings. So now they're at an even bigger disadvantage.

Price's law dictates that organizations become less efficient as they grow larger, so at a certain point, big corporations are better off using their resources to erect obstacles to the competition instead of investing in more growth. Obviously, over time, this is terrible for the economy.

It will be tough for Zoomers and Gen Alphas, sure.

But it is a sacrifice we are willing to take.

The favela shall triumph. This is not a prophecy, it is not a desire or a hope. It is a thirst. It is the nature of the world, like the laws of gravity dictate that objects must fall, so certain is the fundamental need of every brazilian to inconvenience Israel and NATO.

X is used for nothing here besides quick business updates lik warning of gridlocks, gossiping and the usual heavily-censored DEI NATO propaganda.

It won't be missed, The opinions of an individual matter, yet one from the herd is irrelevant. First-worlders love their herd social network because they can easily enforce DEI morality. We are a country that denies the existence of morality, we are a post-irony absurdist civilization. We admit that governance and morality have no ties, and that the only sin on this Earth is getting caught.

I now look forward in hope for our great nation, one less instrument of brother wars removed from us.

Fill within you rage against corpos brother. Direct people to tradies (if it earns well in your nation, or else, direct people to other creative ventures).

The clock, the kikes, the greedy white vultures created this current work climate. Thats the reason why DEI/ESG worked so well. The worker had no way to talk back to horrible policies.

Absolute favorite is probably the Museo Capella Sansevero in Naples. There's no photos allowed but it has probably some of the best marble sculpture EVER. It's a smaller museum and you should book ahead of time. Pompei and The Museo e Real Bosco di Capodimonte and Naples Archeological Museum are also fantastic in the area.

In Venice, definitely visit the Basilica S.Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, where Canova and Titian have monuments (I think they're buried there as well).

Rome obviously has tons of great places but don't miss the Galleria Colonna Museo e Pinacoteca which is only open like one or two days a week, but it's WORTH IT. Lots of great art.

In America there's a few hidden gems you might not think of, like the Huntington Library in Pasadena, California. It has the paintings of that guy squinting at his papers like "what the fuck am I reading". Seeing the memes in real life shocked the hell out of me in a good way.

Protip: it smells like BO. They cram tourists in there like sardines and there's no air conditioning in the entire museum. The Vatican museums are some of the worst in the world in terms of crowd control and if they weren't a sovereign nation they'd be shut down for violating fire code.

Its through hard work as I mentioned initially. Under communism hard work doesnt pay off but as soon as they became capitalist they became a global player very quickly.

Having a dictator helps compared to the transient democratic politicians we have in teh west.
Also, not having DEI and quotas for putting certain races or genders in positions of power helps too.
Its not perfect by any means but in its current for the west has no chance against them.

Jews are the worst people in the world. They'll smile and be your best friend until you don't do what they want, then the gloves come off. They're like reptiles more than people. Niggers are finding out now that all of their civil rights and affirmative action and dei come at a cost, and that is serving their masters without question. Ever since the first jewish on slave ships brought them here, they've been on the jewish plantation without even realizing it. I hate jews so much bros. I think I need a break from the internet.

When I started my career, I worked a lot with scanning electron microscopes that could cost in the millions, and were easy to brick. Messy, careless brownoids would probably fuck them up within a week. It wasn't difficult to work with these machines, but you needed discipline and attention to detail which most people are just not capable of.

>>479968732
Right, there's understanding how the tech works in theory, and then there's getting the factory up and running to produce high-end chips. I can explain how these chips are made step-by-step and I'm not even a computer, software or electrical engineer. But if you put me on front of an ASML lithography machine, I wouldn't know where to start. Very few Americans have seen one on person, let alone operated it or know the closely guarded calibration settings. And I'm pretty sure TSMC would prefer to keep it that way. I don't think they're necessarily hiring brownoids for DEI reasons.

>>479969863
>how hard is it for unemployed autists...

Well, impossible, because you don't have the equipment. Its like asking: how hard is it for an unemployed autist to build a space shuttle? Even if you knew every single step and exact specification, you still wouldn't have the materials or equipment or manpower to get everything into place.

A better question would be: how hard is it for the US government to get this off the ground? If the government was competent and run by White men at approximately the same demograpgic breakdown as during the Manhattan Project, we could make chips tomorrow, match TSMC quality within 5 years, and surpass TSMC in 10. But we can't unless things get really bad because there is no interest from the political class to actually improve anything unless those improvements just happen to line up with the next grift.

>What do you little neo-Nazis have to say about Egabulus, the ancient Roman Emperor
The things a person in the know can say about Elagabalus may be enough to outright nuke the official history of abrahamic religion. A very bad and inconvenient character, Elagabalus.
I am also convinced that the troon shit about him is overbloated so much exactly to distract attention from details about his which expose the real history of abrahamism, which has absolutely nothing to do with ancient desert gypos and magic jews rising from the dead.

Do not read further if you value your Judeo-Christianity, otherwise check this out
>Since the reign of Septimius Severus, sun worship had increased throughout the Empire
>Elagabalus was then entitled ... sacerdos amplissimus dei invicti Soli Elagabali, pontifex maximus
>That a foreign god should be honored above Jupiter, with Elagabalus himself as chief priest, shocked many Romans
>A lavish temple ... was built ... to house Elagabal, who was represented by a black conical meteorite from Emesa.
>"this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven..."
>in order to increase his piety as high priest of Elagabal atop a new Roman pantheon, Elagabalus had himself circumcised and swore to abstain from swine

DEI shit aside which is what the developers are crying about and pretending we're all "basement dwelling losers", the issue here is that the studio was trying to make a very generic shooter that already exists on the market without anything new or different. You can play Overwatch for free, and Sony was thinking that this project was still viable despite generic shooters being released on a monthly basis for the past 8 years..

I'm working on a video game right now, and I have to make several changes because some of the ideas are already on the market. Not doing that, people would think it's just a rip off of a previous franchise. How is this not obvious to people with 6-7 figure salaries but it's obvious to someone in their 20s working full time while making a game?

Crash through socialist economic policies or crash from war for Israel.

No, seriously. Let me give you a prime, recent example.

The CSG taskforce that was in the Red Sea in order to stop Houthi missile and drone attacks? You know what happened, well at least some anons and people in the know actually know.

Houthis managed to score a hit on the carrier deck, not a huge deal but still knocking it out of action, some stuff needs to be repaired. First question is how did even one of the missiles get through the defensive screen.

Oh thats right, nigger DEI training as well as some niggers responsible for the system(s) completelly neglected their duty or fubarred it so when it actually came time to defend the ship against a REAL threat, that threat hit. So much for niggers ever being able to maintain or be in charge of or anywhere near CIWS.

Second, oh yeah this is good. When the fire control teams and emergency response proceeded to contain the fire and start basic damage ops, do you know what the nigger gangs on the ship were doing?

Not helping out.

Not fighting fires.

Not administering first aid and helping save injured sailors.

Nah, they were busy running around the crew quarter areas trying to find valuables, cash, and credit cards. STEALING.

Yeah, so fuck niggers, nigger lovers, and the whole pathetic demonic, antichrist shit show. Die in a hell fire asap.

Not even useless, but intentionally harmful every second of their existence.

No, seriously. Let me give you a prime, recent example.

The CSG taskforce that was in the Red Sea in order to stop Houthi missile and drone attacks? You know what happened, well at least some anons and people in the know actually know.

Houthis managed to score a hit on the carrier deck, not a huge deal but still knocking it out of action, some stuff needs to be repaired. First question is how did even one of the missiles get through the defensive screen.

Oh thats right, nigger DEI training as well as some niggers responsible for the system(s) completelly neglected their duty or fubarred it so when it actually came time to defend the ship against a REAL threat, that threat hit. So much for niggers ever being able to maintain or be in charge of or anywhere near CIWS.

Second, oh yeah this is good. When the fire control teams and emergency response proceeded to contain the fire and start basic damage ops, do you know what the nigger gangs on the ship were doing?

Not helping out.

Not fighting fires.

Not administering first aid and helping save injured sailors.

Nah, they were busy running around the crew quarter areas trying to find valuables, cash, and credit cards. STEALING.

Yeah, so fuck niggers, nigger lovers, and the whole pathetic demonic, antichrist shit show. Die in a hell fire asap.

Not even useless, but intentionally harmful every second of their existence.

Niggers are not human and never will be. Kill yourself or die to yourself and whack yourself with a Bible so you can actually think straight if you think otherwise.

Also KYS KYS KYS every DEI nigger lover. Yeah, this is rage inducing. You see, even one nigger will absolutely jeopardize the safety of a whole task force and be more dangerous than any adversary out there.

There won't be a gun confiscation, because no sheriff is going to put his deputies in front of that kind of potential firing squad.
The gun confiscation will be the precursor to the US nationalizing the police force. That's the real sign that things are about to get bad. Right now individual jurisdictions can decide not to enact the DEI/BRIDGE SJW/Woke anti-White agenda. But a nationalized police force will all apply the same laws everywhere.

But before that can happen, the feds will have to go to war with the states, and the counties, and the cities.

Also uh ideally hm. So ideally if people want to remain human you know what I mean and have freedoms that actually mean something uh there's basically the African world and the non African.

The African really 85 IQ is the ideal.

The non really 115 is and as far as pewpews go really a 5 is fine.

People should know two things aren't human. Addiction and technology.

So even in the African world the 223 meme really... It's immature. You're immature. 2 by 2+3 5 long and around 5x5 is ideal.

Why? Well sex isn't supposed to be a BIG deal. Think worry about pedophilia adultery and women's insanity or have an ethos with your imago dei or whatever.

So. Otherwise it's hard to handle the emotion of a lot of men incels whatever that they have an instinct for reproduction fighting and the use of women as a tool to fight over genetic purchase.

All I'll say is if it pushes to race war they'll just use drones to shoot half of all the people by stupidity first so that doesn't actually happen.

That Boars Head meat processing plant is in Jarratt Virginia. Is the plant management team a bunch of DEI hires that would allow food, health and safety procedures to be ignored ?
It seems that they may have since the recall is now 7 million pounds of meats and cheeses. It sounds like they could not figure out exactly when and where the Listeria contamination occurred.
If they knew it was isolated to a single production line on a specific shift they would not have to recall so much product.
They should have cleaning and inspection sheets from the beginning and end of each shift for everything that is in the production area.
It seems like the only way the recall could get so expansive across so many different products and across multiple production shifts is if managements crisis response team discovered that supervisors were pencil whipping their inspection sheets.

CHANGE MY VIEW: Nationalize the credit bureaus Anonymous ID:1kjEENVR Wed 28 Aug 2024 18:38:09 No.479917666  Replies: 4 ViewReport
Credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, & Equifax), also known as consumer reporting agencies, should be nationalized. They serve the public purpose of weighing the financial risk & trustworthiness of each individual citizen. They've been corrupted by profit and incentivize indebtedness in order to raise your credit score. A person can go their entire lives paying off their bills on time and have a mediocre credit score due to not using credit, versus someone with a decent credit score who has a shaky record of paying off bills on time but uses a lot of credit.

Your credit score does not weigh how good you are at handling money, but instead weighs how good you are to make money off of. It incentivizes going into debt. Take the profit incentive off the table and make it a public service that prioritizes an objective individual score based on financial trustworthiness.

Papal Rome sits on the throne of the dragon (dethroned Pagan Rome). And they have the mark of the beast on their right hand (signifying their occupation and actions) or in their forehead (signifying their belief and doctrines). It is Pagan Rome in a new costume; Papal Rome.

"Lateinos" is a Greek word that means "Roman man" and refers to the people and culture of ancient Latium and Rome.

Λ (Lambda) = 30
Α (Alpha) = 1
Τ (Tau) = 300
Ε (Epsilon) = 5
Ι (Iota) = 10
Ν (Nu) = 50
Ο (Omicron) = 70
Σ (Sigma) = 200

Sum of the Greek numerals:
30 + 1 + 300 + 5 + 10 + 50 + 70 + 200 = 666.

"Vicarivs Filii Dei" is a Latin phrase that translates to "Vicar of the Son of God." This title has been attributed to the Pope, suggesting his role as the representative or deputy of Jesus Christ on Earth.

Vicarivs:
V = 5
I = 1
C = 100
A = (no value)
R = (no value)
I = 1
V = 5
S = (no value)

5 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 5 = 112

Filii:
F = (no value)
I = 1
L = 50
I = 1
I = 1

1 + 50 + 1 + 1 = 53

Dei:
D = 500
E = (no value)
I = 1

500 + 1 = 501

Sum of the Roman numerals:
112 (Vicarivs) + 53 (Filii) + 501 (Dei) = 666

Look up the Jew wikipedia.
Find out that Great Britain was fightinf the Ottoman Empire, and were dividing up Palestine.
Jews in Great Britain are like ooooooo, we want so.e of that.
Jews convince GB to create a place in Palestine just for the Jews, because oh Jews are persecuted and don't have a home.
GB obliges, gives them "Mandatory Palestine", all about WWI.
WWII rolls around, America divides Palestine into Israel for the Jews and Palestine for the natives.
UWatM8
Both GB and America are HUGELY to blame, almost entirely, for giving the Jews a central place to fester, and make their own laws, i.e. approving pedophilia.
Jews have gone crazy and are genkcifing their neighbor - the native Palestinian's, outside of the Israel border - That's akin to Canada or the U.S. and killing, raping, bombing, and confiscating real estate on the present native reservation -> we don't do that, but the Jews do.
From that central point, and eith the legitimacy of country, and the expertise in guilt tripping and victim blaming, they have convinced governments worldwide to contribute to them,
but not just from there,
Jews rise the ranks of daily life all over the globe, becoming PHDs, experts in fields, and then pushing whatever agenda they want without much challenge- after all they Are the expert,
The other part is rising the ranks of politics,
So Jews become "experts" and spout shit like DEI is good -- when it's factually not, and then their tribe in governments all over the world agree, and push for DEI reforms, and then because Israel is a minority
it just goes fucking on and on dude
It's an organized and concerted global effort over millenia.

Every Canadian I know loves the migrants rushing in here and even say we need DEI hires to fight racism, all at the cost of native Canadians of course.

Commies can get fucked, but I've heard from people I trust in real life that the game is fun. I have no interest in that style, so I'll never play it, but I don't believe anyone is being forced to say it is good.
>>479893129
None of that matters. There are all kinds of popular games that I think are dumb and personally have no interest in playing.
I don't give a fuck about Chink myths nor do I want to play as some ape creature, and I don't I really like this genre anyway.
The stats say it's popular and people I have talked to outside this Congolese snake charmers forum have said it's a decent game.
Commie slaves have BTFO some shitty DEI game made in the West. It's a black mark against DEI. That's good as far as I'm concerned.

In a way it's good. The West we have idiots pissing away money on bullshit DEI garbage that doesn't sell because they don't even care if it's fun. Spreading their cancerous ideas is their only objective.
If commie propaganda is gaining traction our leaders will stop incentivizing this DEI crap because competing with the commies requires actually making a fun game, rather than our own bland propaganda that pushes a message and only reaches a wide audience if there is no competition at all.

It’s much worse than that. The EU and US government fund these games to then study “white wing hate groups” reactions. There are entire organizations and grants dedicated to this. Look into the Oregon Trail founders, Mavis Beacon, etc. PC games in schools were a government experiment from day one. Like news journalists, game journalists are merely the entry level corporate stooge position. They rise in the ranks by joining the studios and the gaming conventions. All of these entities are behind the DEI push. Foreign countries too, DiGRA in Israel, etc.

Now we're going in circles. As I originally said, you'll find that your average housewife or working class man don't conform to the moral sensibilities preached by the elite. Again, we see this in history with riot, where sometimes the holy men were mutilated and killed in the streets by mobs despite millennia of indoctrination. You see it today in that they endlessly push the most holy thing is DEI but look at what most individuals actually think of it.
> The vast majority of the population are not intellectuals. They don’t have the capability to question authority.
To not adhere to something doesn't require any intellectual masturbation exercise, ultimately individuals are motivated by their instincts, not doctrine. Uprisings in history where they very much 'questioned authority' did not involve using their intellect to question authority. Again, whether they lose to a force of knights riding in and establishing violent control is irrelevant to the issue we've been discussing.

Yes, and? Why not hire someone whom you trust and can be confident that they are well prepared and will work hard. It's the exact opposite of DEI.

Yes, it sucks to be us when they control much of the media, finance, whatever, but they mostly did it by hard work and hiring qualified jews. When you have been persecuted for whatever reason, right or wrong, you tend to circle the troops; the fact that they have done it spectacularly well in the realms they chose is undeniable.

The Papacy is the seat of antichrist.

They worship the image of the beast (dethroned Pagan Rome). Papal Rome sits on the throne of the dragon. And they have the mark of the beast on their right hand (signifying their occupation and actions) or in their forehead (signifying their belief and doctrines). It is Pagan Rome in a new costume; Papal Rome.

"Lateinos" is a Greek word that originally means "Latin man" or "Roman" and refers to the people and culture of ancient Latium and Rome.

Λ (Lambda) = 30
Α (Alpha) = 1
Τ (Tau) = 300
Ε (Epsilon) = 5
Ι (Iota) = 10
Ν (Nu) = 50
Ο (Omicron) = 70
Σ (Sigma) = 200

Sum of the Greek numerals:
30 + 1 + 300 + 5 + 10 + 50 + 70 + 200 = 666.

"Vicarivs Filii Dei" is a Latin phrase that translates to "Vicar of the Son of God." This title has been attributed to the Pope, suggesting his role as the representative or deputy of Jesus Christ on Earth.

Vicarivs:
V = 5
I = 1
C = 100
A = (no value)
R = (no value)
I = 1
V = 5
S = (no value)

5 + 1 + 100 + 1 + 5 = 112

Filii:
F = (no value)
I = 1
L = 50
I = 1
I = 1

1 + 50 + 1 + 1 = 53

Dei:
D = 500
E = (no value)
I = 1

500 + 1 = 501

Sum of the Roman numerals:
112 (Vicarivs) + 53 (Filii) + 501 (Dei) = 666

Boeing doesn't make tires. Lol. While boeing might be reeling from bad managerial decisions everyone's take on the company because of what the media is reporting on is limited hangout bullshit. It's all designed to obfuscate the truth which is the U.S is being deindustrialized at rapid speed and corporations are on a short-run blitz to maximize profits and we are all going to be left destitute in 20 years with no jobs but being ball-washers for the elite ruling class.
It's not about dei beyond that being the virtuous "we were trying to make things better" excuse the ruling class will use to appease the cattle into the slaughter house. While you're mad at the victims you will allow for the changes to occur in passive-agressive angst because deep down you know you can't lash out at who you think you need to because the real perpetrators took off with the bag.

That's because they're being misused. The idea behind political hires is to give a protected layabout a job in exchange of favours.
You're supposed to give them sinecure jobs, not something that actually matters. You can carry a bag of rock, but you can't expect a bag of rocks to carry you.

Go to the police anon and try to send that nigger to jail. You're lucky all that happened from a wild nigger attack was that your foot got maimed, but unfortunately we live in a society where the wild monkey catcher will only come to help you after you have already been attacked. There are cameras everywhere and everyone has cell phone GPS attached to them these days. They can probably find that evil nig, and if you get lucky it might be a famous or important dei nig which we would all be better off if they were removed from society and put in jail.

How many people did niggers poison today in the USA?

1,000,000?
More than that?

And some people want Kamala Malala, who will just shove more DEI noggertopia everwhere, do some sham coverup trials, and the problem will continue on. As will the violence, theft, and serious crime.

All of you people from news to ic to corporate are now gaslighting each other with “surely they didn’t do that”
“If we actually report this who will believe us, they’re just like us”
“Surely these numbers are fake… they must be hyper stealth racism”.
So many psyops upon psyops and propaganda that you automatically dismiss the facts.

If niggers stopped poisoning everyone around them that isn’t a nigger because of their constant hatred and impulsivity problems. Bwahahahaha, like that’s going to happen. Niggers rather blame whites and Asians again for being racist.

Fucking niggers never stop and carry some kind of genetic chip on their shoulder. No matter what you do, they’ll only get worse and worse, especially if you help them.

America doesn’t have a food quality problem.
America has a nigger problem.
Americas has a nigger problem.

Why quote 'leaker video's as if you are denying they were leaked videos?

The answer is because your thinking is so corrupted that you literally have to reframe things and deny video.

Of course they were leaked videos. And there has never been a rational explanation for why she pulled a suitcase out from under the table and then ran them multiple times through the ballot scanner at 1:30 in the morning.

And her name was ruby freeman..but you spend so much time denying reality you literally can't be reasoned with.

You are less than us. Basic. Like an animal. People like you get power through group think and dei. People like you are in control in places like San Francisco and New York and Baltimore.

Places where life is cheap and there is literally human shit on the sidewalk. Where industry dies and the wealthy live inside walled compounds.

But you don't understand that it is your kind of thinking, selfish, narcissistic, emotional thinking, that causes all of it.

And so you quote things that are factual to reframe them to fit your fantasy. A fantasy where you have an idea what is rational and what isn't.

A fantasy where Biden got more votes than Obama and won an election with only 1/17 bellweathers.

You're so fucking dumb you have broken the world.

>If they actually need capable bodies they'll drop the DEI shit overnight.
DEI needs to be rejected across all career fields. I can't stand this illiberal far-left shit that puts people's innate characteristics, i.e. skin color, over their individual merits or skills. Hiring a person merely because they're black and not because they meet the qualifications for a job is fucking retarded.

Corpos are fucking awful. They'll just have to get literally shit on by India to face the consequences, since they don't learn lessons.

I worked at a Meijer before. Their approach to DEI was basically, "Here's a rainbow, please fuck off." I'd say the family that runs it isn't too invested in DEI when their staff turnover is the bigger worry.

Home Depot corporate fucking sucks. The company is going down the drain. We lie to investors all the time. The CEO Decker told investors recently that we’re phasing out DEI. I was on an “optional” (mandatory) DEI call for three hours the next week and my role has nothing to do with it.

We’ve outsourced 200+ jobs to India in the past few months. 100 or so H1Bs on staff making more than me to write 3 lines of comments in a JIRA ticket every month. The managers are all jeets and niggers jerking each other off. If you’re white or asian you’re forced to keep your mouth shut or you get managed out. You could literally keep the company humming along and they’ll side with some idiot with a fake degree from India instead.

The smart money already reduced their positions in this dumpster fire. Do not support this woke, failing company.

Burger troops already revolted at the mention of burgers risking their lives and safety for israel. The DEI tranny mutt troops will not fight, and zoomers already posted countless vidrels online stating that they'd either flee the country, use their psych problems or being fat to disqualify themselves, or choose prison over fighting since they'll still have their limbs and lives after getting free room and board for months

Otherwise, burgerland would have already attacked Iran. That being said, burgerland has NEVER won a war game or simulation against Iran. Even 2 decades ago in 2002 for the $250B wargames, Iran was kicking their ass with low tech cheap weapons, due to the geography of the water and the mountainous terrain of Iran, and their unconventional method of fighting. 22 years later, Iran is now high tech and extremely capable of fighting, so it would go down even worse for the burgers if they tried.

China has a series of asset bubbles caused by what trump referred to as currency manipulation. Basically when interest rates are bottomed out like the obama and trump era sub1% rates, its very easy to borrow dollars and spend them in economies with high interest rates where investment is slower. Conversion of cash is a suboptimal investment strategy so borrowing dollars and then collecting interest on yuan is not as effective as moving that low interest american cash into real estate or raw material manufacturing. As a result china had a large construction bubble and a large raw material import bubble that popped when american interest rate hikes occurred under biden. You can see charts where the value of yuan plummeted after the covid free money sugar rush wore off. Factually though, price correction is no where near as painful as a trade war with a country that produces everything for you. America cannot even manufacture 5% of its over the counter medication or antibiotics anymore. BYD cars are almost 1/4th the cost of american high end EVs. China produces batteries for the rest of the world and sits on a massive pile of aluminum and lithium that america simply cannot compete with. They also have a massive skilled labor pool that tim cook cums his pants over every time he talks about how shit american manufacturers are.

No, they aren't ceasing DEI - just cutting the departments. Research BRIDGE, and you'll quickly come to understand that businesses aren't abandoning DEI, but shifting responsibility for it & visibility. Take the example of Microsoft; they cut their DEI department, but also plainly stated that they "still believe in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion".

The basic idea; get rid of the visible departments for DEI, and instead make DEI the standard practice in every department/every employee of the company.

Again, research BRIDGE. This shit isn't going away.

1. solve the housing crisis, no one wants to have kids while living with their parents, or if rent is like 80% of their income.

2. End the anti male propaganda, it's preventing women from forming relationships, and just pushing them into hookups with men who literally won't settle and just want to fuck every woman they meet.

3. dating apps have got to go, they are preventing the type of effort that actual long term relationships require, and causing people to hook up based on superficial factors, while completely ignoring actual comparability (mentality, perspectives, beliefs, lifestyles, interests, etc...)

4. End DEI, the girlboss culture has basically combined with hypergamy to prevent women from even seeing most men. if the woman is qualified and competent, sure, hire them, but don't just hire them to fill a quota.

just my 2 cents.

imagine you spent the last 8 years basically jerking off collecting DEI/ESG and globalhomo money, telling yourself you are going to own the chuds with the infinite fiat currency you are constantly being given. Your entire life revolves around this idea that you are politically and spiritually superior because you support globalhomo. You're on the right side of history, you are waging a war of good versus evil, you can do no wrong and the best thing is that the game is rigged so hard its impossible to fail. You own the media, you control all the platforms, youve spent almost a decade systematically taking apart the old system to replace it with your new 'better' one. While other people in the movement might have a more important role tackling bigger issues, you believe yours has value and merit and its important to own the chuds by adding nigger dykes to every videogame from now on and until the end of time. Media is culture and if you can trick people at a young enough age, they will come to find your views to be real and valid. The goyim will learn to love it, they have no choice after all.

Then some bugmen release a game that completely dabs on your entire life. It has no niggerdykes, no lgbtq, no angry black women with afros. And the worst thing is, not that it succeeds finanically and that people genuinly like it but....... it doesnt even acknowledge your world view. This isn't some nazi game made by right wing incels. White racists arent ralleying behind it because it has dog whistles and the mc is secretly hitler. It isn't some alt right gasp at relevancy. Its a completely, unrelated, cultural group whose values are completely alien to your own. You suddenly realize: Globalist bullshit only works in a bubble. It only works when theres nothing to compare it to, when nothing is allowed to criticize it. Youve spent your whole life investing in the false left/right globalist narrative, and then a monkey came in and slapped with his stick.

some of you might be wondering why so many companies go for DEI.

well the truth is that they understand trans folk are mentally ill and no company wants to be 'that guy' that attacks the mentally ill for being mentally ill. So we just claim to support them and let them live a happy life of ignorance while the company still focuses on it's capital gain but if they get a decrease in profits for saying they support something they will do a 1080 and claim to not support it.

so yes, anons. if you were more careful with your money you can and should lead the company to what you want to do by simply not buying anything because you are protesting something they done.

so the whole "trans rights" thing is really "mentally ill rights" and yes, most trannies do not buy products.

You need the full picture.
Are you seeing their reality or a farce?
For instance, they guy next door with the bigger house and new truck may have insane monthly payments he can barely handle, such that a minor crisis would ruin his life.
If you are smart enough to live sustainably (not in the environmental sense, but in the 'being content to live within your means sense), you actually are better off.
On a side note, HR teams, universities/research institutes are so filled with DEI fags that, even though you'd be an excellent hire, your chances of getting the job are abysmally low.
If you can get your foot in the door you can become invaluable quickly, but that's a very heavy door.

Glowniggers have been manipulating you through video games for decades. It really kicked off in around 2003, when DARPA began funding DiGRA which is what they use to study video games and the most effective means of programming their slaves and conditioning them to act in predictable ways similar to the MKULTRA experiments.

The DEI stuff you see all comes from one man, Larry Fink. Larry Fink is a founder of BlackRock the largest financial powerhouse in the world that has enormous power in the banking sector. How modern video games work (especially from medium - large studios) is that while they are developing their games which can take years they get loans from banks to pay the talent, the payroll of the company.

DEI is a system invented by Larry Fink where every corporation looking for a loan must first acquire enough "points", the less "diverse" the video game is the more points the company loses. If you lose enough points then you don't get a loan, if you go far into the negative the credit companies will blacklist your product and you will lose most of your sales. It is a system of total legalized blackmail.

And now this thread will die.

We’ve outsourced 200+ jobs to India in the past few months. 100 or so H1Bs on staff making more than me to write 3 lines of comments in a JIRA ticket every month. The managers are all jeets and niggers jerking each other off. If you’re white or asian you’re forced to keep your mouth shut or you get managed out.

It's showing other studios that you don't have to cave in to the DEI mafia.
What you have to understand is that Blackrock et al literally see videogames as brainwashing machines. Gamergate was successfully memory-holed from being an expose of DARPA using games and games journalism to research brainwashing techniques to gamers sending death threats to whores.
Sweet Baby Inc was another extremely sketchy company that out of nowhere was consulting every single company, from indies to AAA. Her own CEO is in talks saying that leftists in gamedev need to extort their superiors into adding their propaganda "or else".
And now this game, which gave them the middle finger and actually exposed them, is incredibly successful. Million times more than any leftist propaganda slop that has been released.
This is gamergate 2.0 in the sense that the kikes are losing grip in their latest propaganda machine. TV and holocaust movies was how boomers were supposed to be brainwashed, videogames and social media is how these new generations were supposed to be programmed.
And they lost their grip in both.

They are in full panic mode.

What's breaking these people so hard and why they are so distraught over this game is that it shatters almost every narrative the industry and the cultists in it have built up.

It's a game that actively ignored journalists, that wouldn't even answer them when they made up lies about them, that made it a point not to include """"diversity"""", that targeted people that actually play games, and the developers actually went out of their way to oppose journalists, diversity, and the DEI firms that threatened them.... now this might be forgettable in their eyes. They'd still seethe for years but they wouldn't have this strong reaction if it didn't release right as not 1, but 3 BIG dei games came out in a row, 2 of which failed in a Biblical manner with all the journalist support they could muster, and one that's about to fail.

It's a drastic contrast and all they can say is "Concord and Dustborn are just b-bad games ," but it shows that regular people have completely rejected the agenda and are sick of it, and in turn, they are rejected themselves. It's kinda amazing.

Simple. Declining EROEI means no more growth forever. In order to reduce consumption you need a smaller, more efficient population. They've been trying to kill off niggers and retards with abortion, drugs, trooning, and letting them murder each other but that isn't fast enough so they need WW3 to really reduce the population. The most amusing trick has been the DEI boycotts on shit no one needs to drive down consumption. Harleys, Budweiser, target, niggerball, etc are all trash consoomerism and they have "muh right" shutting it all down thinking it was their idea. Biden Harris are intentionally acting retarded because no one will die for 'Murica besides the dumbest Trump niggers so they want to swing national sentiment as right as possible despite there being nothing that can stop declining EROEI.

>(slang) A young person with the fashion sensibilities of a hippie, or any other countercultural trend, especially anarchism, Maoism, or punk rock, who subscribes to an unemployed, shiftless life of hedonism based upon an unlimited amount of funds (a trust fund).

I can't overstate how much is actually in this task.
Humans struggle with context. Computers won't be able to do it until we give them a formula to do it.
Which means we need a self-updating database of context surrounding the computer system employed. Artificial Intelligence will work better the SMALLER it's environment is. If you have 4 objects in a room and tell it to chain together 100 instructions, i.e. you would write that program yourself in half a day, AI will understand you. If you try the entire fucking world, good luck. You'd have to learn how children learn and do shit first, translate that into algorithms, categorize all the fucking things, maybe even invent a new language specifically for this which strips our languages of all the ambiguity (to strip = to remove OR to undress etc. just for one example), which would be a gigantuan task for only the most dedicated of autists. Try finding those among the brain-fried masses. I would postulate there's maybe some genuine people at google useful for the task but far too few, everyone and their brother wanted to be a googler and now they're full of jeets and DEI slopshite people.

Everything post debate shows that Trump and his campaign team have zero political acumen. In 2016 if he didn't have Bannon and Kelly Ann, he never would have had all of Bill Clinton's rape accusers at the debate after the pussy tape was released. Here's how it should have went down:
>Trump/Biden debate
>Trump clearly wanted Biden to stay in the race. So he should have posted/said "Crooked Joe is too cowardly to face me again!" and "Coward Joe is being pushed out by Nancy Pelosi and the Dem elites! Image being so weak!". Biden's handlers would have shown Biden this and it would have gotten under Biden's skin. Instead Trump went radio silent and the only thing Biden heard/saw was pressure from Dems and media to drop out
>Even if Biden did still drop out after Trump's taunts, Trump could have said "VICTORY! I have defeated Joe Biden just like I did in 2020. Now we have to defeat whoever is next!" and "Elite Dems and media pushed out cowardly Joe because they knew how unpopular him and his policies are. Whoever is next will just be more of the same!"
>Instead when Joe dropped out Trump mostly went silent...again
>as Kamala was being crowned Trump should have framed her as a CA liberal. Gibs for illegals, tent cities, crime, etc. Instead we got "she's and Indian DEI hire!"
It was the worst month in political history.

The biggest ethnic cleansing of ALL TIME is that of black babies by abortion. Nearly HALF of all babies killed by abortion are black, and nearly 40% of black pregnancies end with the baby being killed in the womb. As blacks are only 13% of the population these numbers are horrific

What's fucked up is that jobs aren't necessarily being "stolen". They're created specifically for immigrants. DEI poolicies ensure that brown people are given opportunity when they haven't earned it, which on it's own would be bad enough but there's more. These companies often collect government subsidies. Governments like keeping employment up so they give corporations money to employ people, but if these people need subsidies to be hired then isn't that just an indirect and inefficient version of welfare?
If anyone knows Ubisoft (alleged game publisher) they'd know the Canadian studios were built and funded by the government to create multimedia jobs. I cant think of a single game made by them in a long time that didn't seem mass produced and soulless. They also take in a lot of Indians since it's Canada and have a minimum amount of non-Canadians they must hire, so the Canaandian government is basically giving immigrants money just for coming and calling it work. It's soft UBI, a UBIsoft if you would. It's something you'd expect to hear happening in some Soviet bloc.

I'm voting against Kamala because I'm against globalism, transgender grooming of kids, DEI, CRT, gun control, and woke ideology in general.

You'll never convince me to not eternally vote against the woke left, because the woke left have openly embraced all of the things that I despise.

Even Trump's weaker stances, like the vaccine and legal immigration, are actually superior to Kamala's position.

Case in point, the vaccine. Trump pushed the vaccine as the advice of his experts - but the woke left did the exact same thing, and on top of that, the woke left seeks vaccine mandates. Trump has stated that he will never impose mandates, so Trump wins on the vaccine issue.

Trump stated that he wanted legal immigration, which sucks - but Kamala wants both legal and illegal immigration, and threatens to grant legal status to illegal invaders. So once again, Trump wins on the issue.

Kamala completely follows the NWO/WEF/Globalist/Woke party line, so she has a worse taken on almost everything else as well.

Trump 2024.
Keep Kamala out!

Short term, replace 99% of the writers with AI, have their outputs checked by a few good people from back in the day, it doesn't have to be someone with a background in writing, on the contrary the least professional education they have the better, the layman knows what he or she wants to watch and what is good. Maybe put an aging actor on payroll to run the outputs by to see if they notice any glaring issues with a script that has been ai genned. All non lead roles will be ai genned and a few human editors to make sure know mistakes get by, also any creative changes must be approved, can't have nonsense introduced that will turn off actual paying audiences. Lastly any human actor must sign an agreement to not make any social media posts while under contract. Too many times has a retarded actor gone off and proved they are in fact retarded by posting about shit they have no clue about, ie personally I am in the fuck israel and fuck palestine camp, both are garbage.

Long term replace 99% of entertainment media with AI generations both live action and animation, conduct public polls for the type of movie people want to see and then make it happen with ai magic. If people actually want a reboot it can happen, rebooting a dead franchise is stupid, some stories should have ended on a high note rather than continuing. If they want new IP make sure you know what people want rather than shitting something out they will likely hate. And finally no political propaganda, left or right, of course that will upset a lot of dems as the absence of propaganda and dei to them is like stabbing them the heart since they are so brain damaged.

Elon wants to go to mars.
The west is offering him Boeing and diversity hires who strand astronauts in space.
The Russians are offering experience and reliability, and at least a working space program with people who want to go to space and do science rather than queef all over the international space station.
Yea sure Im not surprised he is hedging his bets when he is the only one in the USA capable of building working rockets. The decline of competency in the west and mass immigration leading to social conflict is not a good basis for a space program.
America and the western world needs to clean house and reverse the course of feminism and DEI before it goes fully over the cliff if it has not already. Likely, these are civilization destroying mistakes.

This. Nobody actually cares about the most unpopular VP in history suddenly being shoved into running for prez less than 100 days before election. Initial astroturfing aside, DNC is keeping the majority of that Biden/Harris campaign $ and we just saw their only actual push trying to drum up support. We got brat, weird, joy, and (pathetically) V I B E S as a result. Guess the push to force memes was even DEI-tier since none caught on and the more people see of her the less they like. It's a clearing of the decks now, knocking Harris out of political aspirations forever, pocketing already collected campaign money, and regrouping for '26 midterms and grooming '28 candidates. Dems are dead party walking at the moment and no amount of media manipulation, cardboard polls, and forced memes will change that.

Even now the potential is there but there has to be some structural reform - make DEI/Nepotistic policies illegal across the board in private and in public contexts, more authoritarian policing in cities to make them livable, reform the immigration system to brain drain the rest of the world of their talent, and create strong incentives for intelligent people to procreate.

Those would be my big ones. I think giving out semaglutide for free would also fix 90% of the obesity crisis, make most people attractive, and make finding an attractive partner and having kids easier.

Gen X is the most conservative generation by a wide margin, even more than boomers. We are firmly, rabidly and intensely anti-DEI and anti-woke. We were raised by feral boomers who couldn't be bothered and who kicked us out of the house in the morning and didn't let us back in until the street lights came in. We have thick fucking skins. We think you are all fucking pussies. We saw from an early age that it was all down hill and wasn't getting any better. We're only now being "allowed" any control over anything because boomers, rather than retiring and passing the torch, refused to fucking leave their posts and pushed their hippy horseshit thinking that the world was still as it was 60 fucking years ago. That's it in a nutshell.

Trump is a pro-DEI and pro-ESG faggot. He gave speeches at Davos and praised Klaus while his supporters spoke against it.

No president has been better for the Democratic Party than Donald Trump. White males need to start colonizing shithole countries and creating a new America because this experiment is over.

political implications of fake job listings Anonymous ID:aV+LUY0H Mon 26 Aug 2024 11:50:42 No.479659890  Replies: 10 ViewReport
It's funny that CNPC doesn't mention the real political reason why there are so many ghost job listings. When an ad is put up, they already have someone in mind - a 3rd world guy sitting on bricks and sleeping under his desk. The true reason why there's a listing is to justify the H1B hire by saying "we didn't receive sufficiently qualified applicants". The tech industry is now hiring exclusively from the 3rd world and don't even bother with 1st world applicants - and race has nothing to do with it even despite the DEI garbage - they just don't want people from the 1st world at all because they can't be abused and manipulated as easily. You can't find a job because the oligarchs rigged the system to get literal slaves who don't have rights.

I think boycotts are pretty effective.
The ruling class likes to pretend the money is infinite but we've clearly done some severe damage to DEI, Larry Finks terrible idea. Look at the movie industry where Disney has pushed the woke diversity propaganda super hard, but nobody is buying it at all. They've had 5 or 6 flops in a row and it's costing them hundreds of millions of dollars each. And they've destroyed all of their social capitol as well since nobody trusts that they even CAN make a good movie anymore. When people assume all you can make is dogshit, they will stop buying your dogshit at all. So I would say more than voting, choosing not to spend any money with certain industries is striking a terrible blow directly at the heart of our enemy. They bleed money and when they bleed out they die because to them money is god.

The real number is like 80% of people know they were better off under Trump, but will refuse to admit it out of a stubborn sense of pride. I talked with my parents over the weekend, for some perspective they're lib boomers and all of their children are various shades of right wing, mostly because we all got royally fucked by affirmative action and DEI growing up. They're doing worse than five years ago, Harris's unrealized gain tax will ruin them financially, and yet they're still digging their heels in because "Trump called other countries shitholes" and other stupid shit like that.

But Don came with stats and fact checks. All Elon had to say was that his fear was that leaning too heavy on DEI would have someone more qualified passed up. Current DEI can find stats to justify its existence, doesn't mean they're good stats or even that the information is honest. Bringing it to the anecdotal level of possibility in that conversation removes having to contend with whatever convenient articles Don could cite at the time.

That's not even to say Don was right, if Elon had the prep time, he could come at Don with stats and articles and Don wouldn't have info to back up what he was wanting to believe.

NASA is part of the problem as well. Everything that they were telling the public (and their bosses) was all done to run political cover for Boeing. They both failed and Boeing Starliner is in the books as a complete disaster. Now they whine and bitch about the successes of their rival non-DEI company now having to clean up the Starliner mess. The media loves headlines but there is certainly one blinding headline that they all missed: DEI ENDS BOEING'S FUTURE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS WITH NASA.
There is not one larger company out there that did more damage to DEI than Boeing ever did.

He was given a show on X and his first guest was Elon. He asked Elon about his more rightwing beliefs and information he signals and it put Elon on the defensive about the "!" posting he does that draws attention to things like black on white crime and white population demographics. Elon retreated saying he doesn't believe anything he does the "!" thing to, he just wants to bring attention to it. He ran from the question as to why he wants to bring attention to it, what is it about those news articles that he thinks deserves more attention.

Also he questioned his anti-DEI stance about quality going down with diversity. It's an awkward question because it can be spun as "you think the fewer white males in an industry brings down the industry" and then it's defended as "I want deserving and skilled workers" which the question is "do you think only white males are deserving and skilled". Elon wasn't the best at answering that even though there's a way to answer without falling into traps or being racist.

So he was fired for not giving a softball interview with easy and flattering questions.

he was also a mason, and calling facts nazi does nothing any good, especially here!
so my original point that got everyone so upset was that what we see as modern leftism has nothing to do with marx and everything to do with masonry. i showed that modern psychology is largely dependent on jung, who was an outright occultist and wrote many books on the subject. this is not a controversial statement.
i also showed that communism comes from occult and masonic ideas of a return to the age of chronos/golden age
i showed that ayn rand's capitalism is just slightly reworded gnosticism and freemasonic ideas as well. so keep arguing over which masonic claptrap is the best, and keep calling me a nazi when you aren't too busy calling me a communist, neither of which could be further from the truth.
if you don't notice or care that it's blackrock, not the government, pushing dei on everyone then you should just go away. bill gates and big phaerma, owned mostly by the rockefellers, pushed the covid vaccine and made zillions. trudeau is an oil man ffs, that's why he is against the oilsands, it competes with his middle east sweet crude holdings that supply irving gas stations. george soros is one of the richest men in the world and he is pumping billions into BLM and antifa, this is not communism.
i have met loads of people from the former soviet bloc and many of them want to go back to communism. they had housing, food, never had to worry about bills or coming up short with money. there were not a lot of luxuries, but as one romanian told me, everyone in the commieblocks would gather together outside in the evening and play musical instruments, sing, really have a community. basically don't rebel against the government and you are ok.

DEI is no joke. My doctor friend who works in a hospital in Germany was shocked whenever a random mystery meat immigrant doctor would get hired despite having no qualifications whatsoever. He told me that every single year his hospital would hire assistants or doctors from Syria, Afghanistan etc and every single time it would end in them finding out that a) the applicant either lied about his experience or b) the applicant lied about his degree altogether. They had to assign other doctors, usually german or european, to always double-check whatever these retards did due to lawsuits and stuff. And every single time he complained about it to his superiors, he got shrugged and told that the hospital had to pass a certain diversity quota in order to get more funds from the local gov. In the end most of the qualified doctors gave up complaining and basically started covering for the incompetency on a day-to-day basis, to this very day.

NASA is government-owned, which means it's used for political bargaining more than anything.
Boeing is public, which means it must, by law, try to maximize profit for shareholders. This means that any of those fake "Diversity is our strenght!" studies, like the McKinsey one, must be taken as law - and C-suites could go to jail for not diversifying the company.
SpaceX is private, which means Elon is the absolute king of it. As much as he's a sperg, he's smart enough to not fall for the DEI bullshit. Thus, it prospers against a competition who is barely trying.

They're a very loud minority, much akin to (((gaming journalists))), who constantly parrot DEI propaganda and tank games, like Concord, Suicide Squad, and Dustborn. All of these western countries have millions of people employed who work ordinary jobs, from paycheck to paycheck, such as clerks, office workers, plumbers, electricians, telephone operators, food delivery, janitors, various kinds of drivers, and so on... I wager that driving a truck can be quite lucrative, but those in this business are trading all of their free time for the road and the money, so they need to have a certain kind of personality to find enjoyment and fulfillment in this type of work.

>Some so-called feminists have used the movement as a means to justify inequality in social issues concerning men and women, notably in divorce court proceedings, which still operate as if it is 1950. How do we reconcile such inequality that is a remnant of a bygone era?

>Some feminists argue that make-up, dresses, etc. cater to the so-called "male gaze" and are therefore to be shunned. How are we to address such issues of prescriptive attitudes towards women by other women under the justification of feminism?

>Social programming such as affirmative action, DEI, etc., undermine faith in the qualifications of women in fields where women are underrepresented as a demographic. How can feminism seek to establish the liberal concepts of meritocracy and equality of opportunity under such conditions? This is an issue I find personally odious, as programs such affirmative action and its ilk force me to draw conclusions that I find grossly unfair and reprehensible.

It's terrible. The West allowing a brain drain for a country that has almost no brains is turning the literal shithole into the abandoned alien ship in District 9. Within two generations the very, very few who come here with an above average IQ will see their descendants IQ return to the mean. These people on average are literally dumber than American blacks. They practice tribalism and nepotism just like Jews. This is just another nightmare scenario that will peak just in time to see the peak results of the rest of the DEI/affirmative action competency crisis.

3.No risk taking.
Because of stakeholder capitalism and black rock DEI funding Movies stopped taking risks. because of expectations of profit a lot of movies started to become sequels and reboots of recognizable properties instead of original properties.

4.Lack of competition. Because there are only four studios left they all play it more safe in order to try and keep from being cannibalized. There use to be numerous studios in the 90's who would release different types of films so you had more competition as well as more variety. But these studios all got bought up in the 2000's.

>Give me 1 (1) reason to vote for Zion Don
I’m loathe to waste my time responding to your 1pbtid post. Donald Trump does such massive dick in 2024 and absolutely deserves the name “Zion Don.” But it would still be better to see him elected than Harris/Walz, for several reasons:
1) The next president will probably install three Supreme Court justices we’ll have to deal with for the rest of our lives. And Trump (while retarded and useless) will probably not pick pro DEI, pro hate-speech laws, anti gun justices to the bench.
1) Trump (while still retarded and useless) will probably not go on the attack against the 2nd Amendment and will actively resist calls to do so.
3) Trump will inadvertently cause the establishment to show its ass in appalling ways (like he did in his first term). The damage that his first term did to the political establishment and mainstream media (through their own over-reactions) was worth the price of admission 100%. And he’ll do it all over again.

Trump is not the final form of the leader our “movement” needs. He’s a very early steppingstone to something better in the future. But he’s a stepping stone we need to step on to get to the next phase of this thing. You’re asking why you shouldn’t just go sit down on the riverbank. And the answer is that you want to get to the other side.

BTW DEI was originally about and created for helping all sorts of marginalized groups of people, the physically disabled and or handicapped, mental disabilities (not just mentally retarded), all sorts of various ethnicities. So think wheel chair bound, chronic exhaustion from COVID, and native Americans, other ethnicities, …etc. it was not built for or exclusively for niggers.

Till they hijacked it, ran into the ground milking it, and now completely shit it up to the point there’s legislation now. So someone who is injured on the job or suffered health sides from procedures, accidents, including memory and seizures is now more shit out of luck because of demonic thieving niggers.

Nigs are actually particularly bad in terms of crime, DEI/competency crisis, IQ, grievance culture, and net fiscal impact on public services.

They are basically like deadweight on the society. If you want to look at who will win this next big great power confrontation with China you have to compare an America that's 50% White and 15% nig and 35% brown vs China which is 95%+ Han Chinese with an average IQ of approximately 105 and over a billion people.

It becomes immediately clear that even if they are less creative and less wealthy to start out with, they have inherent advantages from their homogeneity and high level of general intelligence that will move mountains to compensate for a lack of inherent geostrategic advantages.

Better question: who cares? The ANA certainly didn't. Can't help people that don't want help. The US didn't lose militarily, they failed to instill a sense of national identity into a bunch of illiterate mudslimes and decided the juice was no longer worth the squeeze. The last 20 years can be considered an extended and successful training exercise, that has largely been profitable for the MIC.
>Well, imagine if Mexico was given $400 billion in aid after the US decided to invade after Mexican/Chinese fentanyl killed 200k US citizens. Do you still think the US would have an easy time of invading? Now lets say Mexico was planning this for 10 years and built lots of defense barriers going deep into their territory.
Ukraine didn't receive that aid until well after the invasion began, and their "preparations" largely involved containing the Russian-controlled regions. If it were the US, the "3 day SMO" would have been over before schedule, and we would never have gotten locked into a multi-year war of attrition in the first place. $400 billion over 3 years is nothing compared to our yearly defense budget, much less the value in our stockpiles. Yes, destroying Mexico as a functioning state and government would be exceedingly easy, just like Iraq was.

My question is, why did Trump, who NEVER SHUTS UP, decide to shut up after the debate? If he wanted Biden to stay in he should have taunted him as much as possible in the media with "Dems want Biden to drop out because they know he can't beat me!" and "Crookd Biden running scared from our scheduled rematch election!" Instead he went completely fucking SILENT. Why?
Then they stayed silent when Biden dropped out? No "I WON! What a great day for America!"
Then they went silent when Kamala was coronated in the media. No attacks on her other than "waaah she's an Indian DEI hire!".

Rundown for anyone who isn't a programming autist. Big companies sponsor "open source" projects. There's nothing wrong with that par se, especially if they are actually using a lot of these things in-house, then it's not even for some aluristic reason but actually practical and self-serving.

There has been a slow creep (for 20 years), in getting more women in tech. Even in the early 2000s, companies gave women free stuff for simply enrolling into STEM. They put a lot of money into events and convincing women to get involved. The end goal is similar as to why they try to add more Pajeets: to have lower wages, to have more subservient workers, to prevent any kind of unions or organisation of workers.

Because of the usual DEI nonsense, you have people that are completely unqualified and incompetent get not just into companies but on various boards / admin in the various open source organisations (which are often non-profit foundations taking corporate money). It's hard for people on those boards to fight this if they're taking a substantial amount of money from said corporations which is paying their salary.

Women's style of politics is always the same. They don't know how to actually compromise properly, when there are differences or they feel like there's someone not respecting them as much as they think they should, they immediately go for shaming tactics. Shaming tactics is all women have really when they go on the attack. The shaming then will pressure other (weak men) to do something for them (and get the guy ousted). For those who remember gamergate, it's the same plan, take over.

It's been like that in tech for many years. I've seen it myself at least a few times, where they hire these women from bootcamps to meet some quota and the women are told bullshit like: you're struggling not because you're incompetent, everyone else is just as incompetent as you, they are just hiding it better. they call this "imposter syndrome". It's all so tiresome.

Being overly protective means people begin treating women and children without any accountability.
Children learn to be responsible, behave in a dignified way and grow up to be respectable adults if they are taught and corrected, and are forced to confront their problems head on early in life.
Instead of doing this, in US and former USSR especially, they began to coddle, enable, purposefully stunt and basically mentally imprison people from the young age to enact certain geopolitical and domestic agendas.
Women are also enabled, shielded from the consequences of their actions, and detached from reality.
What happens when people never faced their problems head on or were forced to learn from failures of their mistakes from young age? They become desocialized, entitled, and likely criminal later on in life. Post USSR republics and their 'DEI' criminals represent this problem well, as do many western minorities.
Depriving people of the full responsibilities and expectations of being a man or a woman in any way shape or form weakens them and makes them dependent. When this drags on throughout your life while problems around the world grow like cancer, well we have what we have today.
ISIL and ISIS were like a bunch of rampaging teenagers.

1) Poll numbers for Kamala are a fraction of what they were for Hillary when she lost. Ignore what the dipshits at 538, Nate Silver, and literal tranny Twitter accounts say. Nearly all pollsters have been caught manipulating their numbers to try to generate a fake sense of inevitability for her.
2) The rank-and-file shills who actually perform the cheating operation on the ground aren't nearly as organized and a lot more angry with the DNC than they were in 2020. Them hyping up Beyonce just to trick people into watching Kamala's speech won them no favors.
3) In contrast to the above, Republicans have adopted a twofold strategy of Cheating but Better with people like Scott Pressler doing a shit-ton of registering and ballot harvesting in swing states as well as employing an army of poll workers and lawyers. They've already gained several thousand more volunteers than they were aiming for, and the number only continues to grow.
4) The RFK endorsement, despite how much they're trying to downplay it, symbolizes a unification between Republicans and non-insane liberals who see the Marxist policies of a potential Harris administration and are terrified of them. Even a 1% bump for Trump in swing states would be huge.
5) It took a literal one-in-a-hundred-years pandemic to give them the cover necessary to force through all their cheating, and even then they are barely scraped by via the slimmest of margins.
6) Many swing states, most of all Georgia, have implemented de-fortifying measures to prevent what occurred in 2020 from happening again.
7) Our opponents are a lot stupider this go-around, as they've lost a lot of the talented folks who rigged 2020 to retarded diversity hires thanks to their own DEI policies.

Civ VI was far too superfluous and had such a retarded concept using districts. Made winning x10 as hard than V. But when you bring this up on other gaming forums they say "it's a you problem, did you even read a guide" like no stupid nigger I bought a game that I want to play and achieve moderate success by just playing the fucking game. I'm not a kid waiting for his nintento guides to come out, I'm a fucking adult and I have limited time to enjoy myself. How can Civ V get it so right and Civ VI fail so hard? DEI niggers? If I am putting ships on the fucking planet Mars and Rome achieves a cultural victory that is fucking bullshit. Civ VI was the nail in the coffin, completely unplayable garbage. No doubt this next game will be even worse, more convoluted and way more complex than it needs to be.

How many people did niggers poison today in the USA?
100,000?
1,000,000?
More than that?

And some people want Kamala Malala, who will just shove more DEI noggertopia everwhere, do some sham coverup trials, and the problem will continue on. As will the violence, theft, and serious crime.

All of you people from news to ic to corporate are now gaslighting each other with “surely they didn’t do that”
“If we actually report this who will believe us, they’re just like us”
“Surely these numbers are fake… they must be hyper stealth racism”.
So many psyops upon psyops and propaganda that you automatically dismiss the facts.

If niggers stopped poisoning everyone around them that isn’t a nigger because of their constant hatred and impulsivity problems. Bwahahahaha, like that’s going to happen. Niggers rather blame whites and Asians again for being racist.

Fucking niggers never stop and carry some kind of genetic chip on their shoulder. No matter what you do, they’ll only get worse and worse, especially if you help them.

America doesn’t have a food quality problem.
America has a nigger problem.
Americas has a nigger problem.

I'd say it's too volatile for any reasonable investment beyond speculation. I almost bought a 30 day put contract back in (april?) when one of their planes had a door blow off during flight. I would've lost money on that as the stock actually went up some. However, this was when I realized that there is a potential to profit off of companies who manage complex systems who haven't had their own DEI-tier crisis yet, where the possibility of an insane fuckup isn't priced in to the market yet. These companies often work in sectors like aerospace, defense, technology, energy, and infrastructure. Like Boeing, Northrop Grumman and IBM have been DEI companies for a while now. I have my eye on Target, Proctor & Gamble, and Johnson & Johnson as well, even though they're a little less complex to run than the aforementioned.

The problem with the gook that while they may not be mass immigrating to the west, the few that do get here are as stupid and conniving as the jeet, just not as disgusting.

Like the jeet, the first thing they do is go straight to college, not to learn anything, but to cheat and get a degree to secure their place here. gooks were the original DEI student, meaning they were the first nonwhite to be allowed in white universities, not for merit but for token diversity (because they are retarded subhumans). They achieved nothing despite being overrepresented in academia, they cannot innovate or contribute intellectual advancements, but only copy off the work of a White man. They have no souls, and thus no creativity, but continues to exploit the education system without honor because of their parasitic nature. The jeet, since it is also asiatic, shares this trait as well, and the reason why there's so many niggers, spics, jeets and gooks in college is because gooks first opened the doors to nonwhite, fucking up the value of education, met so many so called gook doctors and programmers who just google their diagnosis or can't write a single line of code.

Reminder that vietnam was colonized by the ((((French))) so a lot of their "culture" revolves around retarded jews.

Anyways, this is an English board, translate the video or get back on your rice farm, nguyen.

How did they screw up?
DEI.
The Jews in Rome had taken over the media, banks and stock exchange in Rome and kept pushing this propaganda about how Rome needs to soften their tone on the barbarians and let non-Italians have a say in politics. Faggotry and transgenderism was rampant. Young white Italian males got disillusioned with this shit coming from the Military and refused to enlist. So Rome took got the slaves in their ranks. People from far away lands with no allegiance to the emperor and unfamiliar and uncaring for Roman way of life came in and helped bring Roman culture down to their shithole level.
What destroyed Rome was DEI.

Affirmative action wasn't actually ended, those numbers prove that. If you do any reading about policy change, you would find out that they still allow students to submit essays about their life experience to get in. Essentially they provide supplementary documentation that shows they're niggers and then they're accepted.
You're still getting DEI and critical race theory and all the other conservative euphemisms for anti-whiteness, they're just changing the names and policy wording around.

I swear Harris is Jeb Bush's divergent timeline. In her case, the establishment candidate with no footing in 2020 got grabbed up by DEI and crowned VP. Skipped over another round of primaries in 2024. Then, the president has to step out of the race, so the party apparatus gives her an extremely comprehensive portrait in the sheep brains and she is suddenly the nominee. She was, indeed, the special guest.

This was Jeb's story, were he an angry colored bitch in the npc party.

The thing is that even if you've never been directly harmed by niggers, any white person with niggers in their country are indirectly harmed by niggers on a daily basis. The increase in crime and violence makes the society low trust, which makes isolation and atomization worse. Whites flee from their traditional neighborhoods and small towns to soul crushing suburbs, while niggers destroy city infrastructure and dissaude whites from investing in things like good public transportation and walkable neighborhoods because no one wants to pay more taxes just to have to be around niggers. The niggerfication of culture makes it impossible for whites to have a common, distinctly white culture to hold in common. Whites are bombarded with propaganda to view whites who don't participate in nigger culture as boring and uncool. This artificially lowers the status of capable white men and artificially raises the status of incompetent blacks. This affects the dating/mating prospects of white men. Even a white girl who has never and will never fuck a black has still been exposed to a lifetime of propaganda telling her to get the ick from a white guy who's too... white. Affirmative action and DEI puts a monkey subhuman in a suit and forces you to pay it deference and respect it doesn't deserve if you want to keep your job. Not to mention how much you pay in taxes to keep niggers alive. So even if every black person you've ever met has been nice and friendly to you, their very cohabitation in your society makes your life dramatically worse than it could be.

Muh Graphics. As well as elite DEI management.

We were supposed to have voxels. Dynamic environments you can destroy.
But the dynamic programming all went away once the movie industry and online competition got involved.

The basic formula is to make a static 3d model and add animations. Good for films, not good for video game logic. They perfected it on N64 and PS2. I can find plenty of examples of more dynamic programming, AI, and art in old games. Like with Red Faction, or I’m sure I can find examples on PS1 of cool programming they don’t do anymore, in favor of mocap, and raytracing…but remember it’s still all static usually. It’s not any better.

You vastly overestimate the capabilities of NATO. Entire NATO couldn’t put together a force to rival Ukrainian Army.
Yeah, population, money spent, high tech, all that, but they simply can’t. West is in a state of cultural and social collapse. That simply must reflect on military affairs. Russia in 1910 was a healthier and more robust state.

You’re just imagining things because of logic that goes “okay Russians are strugling with Ukraine that must mean NATO would wipe their asses”, but no. Ukraine was and is a heavily militarized country with much of population indoctrinated into a nationalist cult, and is the focus of NATO support. What Russians are dismantling in Ukraine is de facto premier and only huge conventional force NATO can assemble in Eastern Europe. Beyond Ukraine, there’s very little.

I think the biggest misconception is that dei is about investment funds, it's interest rates on loans mostly. If you meet the right criteria (esg score) you get a lower interest rate. So the bean counters say 'we borrowed 100M last year at 6% which cost us 6M, if we spend 2M hiring niggers and women we get out finance at 2% we end up 2M better off even if the women and nigger have zero productivity'

And how do you find out exactly how mucy stuff did Jamal compromise or break over his 5 years there?

Have you ever considered the leftists may be on to something? And I say that as a pro-AI person

You can clone someone's artwork but end of the day you will never be that person. Just like how Miles Morales will never be Peter Parker. No, AI should be looked into how it can create new art. But the boomers are just regurgitating slop because they are as creatively bankrupt as the DEI lefties.

Lastly, President Kennedy began to end the Vatican's hoax known as "the Cold War," the American CIA and Russian KGB having secretly worked together since World War II. He also began to end that Jesuit Inquisition in Vietnam, as its future highpoint would be "Operation Phoenix," the CIA mass-murder of 60,000 Vietnamese, "in cold blood" according to its Opus Dei Director, William E. Colby.

The President interfering with Rome's Holy Office of the Inquisition could not be tolerated! Millions of "infidel" Buddhists were to be exterminated, the Pope's International Drug Trade would explode, American patriotism and liberty would further be destroyed and Vietnam would be reunited under Ho Chi Minh— another communist military dictator loyal to the Pope— like Stalin, like Chairman Mao, like Castro, like George H. W. Bush and son. Waged under the guise of opposing the communist empire's "domino effect," Cardinal Spellman championed America's most disastrous conflict known as "Spelly's War" overseen by Spelly's General, the Roman Catholic and CFR member, William C. Westmoreland. (Remember, according to Col. L. Fletcher Prouty in his JFK, the forced movement of over 660,000 Roman Catholics on U.S. Navy transport vessels from North Vietnam into South Vietnam was "one of the root causes of the Vietnam War." The arch-Catholic Secretary of the Navy responsible for implementing that Jesuit-agitation was the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Francis P. Matthews. Knight Matthew's Master was America's "Military Vicar," Francis Cardinal Spellman.

nah man, I was team Bernie all the way in 2016 and 2020, but I've always had sympathy for the Trump movement. I came very close to giving Trump my vote in 2016 but I didn't because I gave into peer pressure. 2020 I voted third party. I'm giving him my support this time around. I liked Bernie originally because he wasn't hyperfixated on the DEI horseshit and he was talking about issues that affect all of us. Problem is he's a cuck and he's too much of a pussy to fight to the end. Either he's being blackmailed and his family and their livelihood is being threatened by the deep state (which more than likely is what these scumbags are doing) or he's a total pussy. Or both. There are no other explanations for his behavior in 2020.

If he flips, he saves his own reputation, and gives trump the election. It would be a near deathblow to dei instantly. It would at least unify a greater chunk of americans than without his endorsement (probably wont move the needle for hardcore lefties even tho hes their guy (they hate trump more than they like bernie)). It would also make the Democratic party completely change course and actually force them to innovate on policy instead of TDS and "party of the working people" rhetoric with no clear policy goals.

He wont do shit tho. A better target would be someone like john fetterman or Raphael warnock. Up and comers with some sway and in critical swing states.

Hot take: I know fetterman is kinda retarded, but if dude switched parties and sold it properly, he could make a run at president come 2028 if jd doesn't end up working out. Dude just exudes working class and people will vote the shit out of that. If the pa senate race parties were flipped he would have won in a LANDSLIDE

Wrong, both opposed the War In Iraq, Trump just has more balls than Bernie and called out the Bush crime family to their faces. Trump is anti-war. anti military industrial complex, and pro peace. Bernie and Trump both talked about curbing the illegal immigration crisis in 2016. Bernie just bent to the DEI fags more in 2020 and unfortunately to his own detriment. Bernie and him ABSOLUTELY have a lot more in common than the media lets on or Trump would let on. His team needs to reach out to him and get him in the cabinet. Bernie as secretary of state and Kennedy as head of the CIA would cause the neocons to go mask off and there would be literal war amongst the federal government at that point. Good. The rats should be forced out and dealt with accordingly. The neocons and the neoliberals need to be stopped. Bernie and Trump teaming up with RFK would be the death spell of neoliberalism.

Shes a literal DEI hire. Biden publicly said he will pick a nigger woman as his VP and there were only two options so he chose this nigger woman to fit the requirements.

I think the nickname should be DEI Kamela.

Since Biden only picked her because she checked the diversity boxes and it will resonate with normies with corporate jobs.

No horse in this race but i think like labeling people so it ruins them.

You cannot possibly believe this. The legislation relaxing regulation on banks had Republican names all over it. THEN, when banks were re-regulated into responsibility, Republicans fought tirelessly to de-fang THAT regulation, again.
The GOP doesn't give a fuck about DEI (except that it dog-whistles you effectively), the only color they give a fuck about is GREEN.

Those times we had an overwhelmingly white population. T levels in men were also significantly higher. We also didn't have the pressure and tradition of outsourcing manufacturing jobs. The government and culture wasn't self loathing clown world hell holes.

If the US were to find itself at war with China, our bank masters would scramble to establish manufacturing in Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, ... any damned where else but the US. They will not deal with the EPA, or OSEA rules, or any of that crap.

Look at Boeing. We're looking down the barrel of WWIII. We're going to need scads of missiles and artillery shells. Yet everything Boeing and other companies like it make are absolute shit. Planes falling apart, Starliner can't come home, etc. They replaced their engineers with DEI hires, their managers with engineering backgrounds with HR Karens, Woke cultists, and their upper management with bean counters that can't see beyond the next earnings report. They can't build anything that works any more, and the only thing anyone cares about is meeting DEI quotas and their own compensation packet.

You really think if things went hot that would all turn around? Not in a year, not in 5 years. There is no patriotism any more. Competent whites have check out of the workforce and military, and for good reasons. That is a self inflicted wound that wont be healed any time soon, if ever. The people in charge are vampires sucking the last bit of blood out of a dying corpse.

Or just falling on hard times.
My job fired me for doing my job, bringing up downed networks, and as a result of no reference im stil out of a full time job. Thus loosing my house, having to shack up on temporary housing and bennies. Is started my own company but its still early days on that front due to no capital. All my savongs got ate up on sustaining me and the kid between jobs (they wont give you bennies until youve used your savings) and the bennies never meet static monthly bills. Its a sure fire way to push people into petty crime to get few extra hundred to meet a simple diet on top. If your qualified and experienced its so much worse for you as bennies have a limit, and they expect you to apply for low skill work too. The low skill work outright says no as overqualified and my professional leads although are promising i never make the last hurdle due too leaning on a technical front rather than sales.
Right now, jobs in tech are not for real engineers. They are want more people who can be socially engaged over introverted techies.
Ive been on all these stupid mandatory appointments and bullshit courses through job centre too, customer service, civil service, dei, cv workshops, work coaches. You name it.
I dont know, like is it because I stink or something? Im not arrogant but I do know my shut when it comes to network architecture and infrastructure. I just cant seem to crack the case...

The problem with the Civil Rights movement is that it was funded by the Rothschilds, and its aim was always leftist in origin.
The sheer propaganda about all the blacks here crying and being motivated by muh slavery or whatever is looked down on by the rest of the world, not to mention they are now proving they just want to take advantage.
How many black crimes against the rest of the country has been passed off as normal in the last 4 years? Most blacks have always been iranian and chinese communist proxies.
This country legitimizes anti-mainstream criminality, consorts with pedos around the world while denigrating any dissidents and labeling them schizos or fools, and is surprised when we are invaded by 10 million deranged, mentally ill genetic refuse south of the border and can't muster up enough entitled, innately hostile DEI population to defend the country.
This is why our country's actual image of national honor is pretty much non-existent on the world stage for all practical intents and purposes. They can only kick the can down the road for so long by subverting other nations through international education, threats, bribery, terrorist tactics, and now having all the woke freaks with barely 100 years of memory trying to dictate to the world who is right or wrong.
Can you imagine the derision and destruction of our nation's credibility around the world?
No wonder they want to blow Yellowstone. No one has any interest in tolerating entitled black behavior anymore.
