can`t really complain. shit looks, feels better now. old stuff had more depth, exiting and out of the norm gameplay, but feels clunky now. I never "imagined" anything other than what we have today. if you need VR glasses in front of your face to immerse your self in this shit, I dont know you do you, but we see what VR is used for today and by what kind of ppl. certainly not ppl that take the "gaming aspect" seriously. the shift from good games with a bright future to gay faggit DEI ESG slop, and publishers and devs being extorted by militant feminists from the 05s till now was a surprise thou and that everyone just got gay in general. but eh, there was nothing we could do, we where busy gaming after all. the games that where good at least. today its mostly 15 or 17 year old mmo´s that can deliver the oohmpf of YE old days. Good single player games occur only every three or for years and the rest is just slogging trough the mid trough of single player slop.

ive never met a white american that’s trivialized the plight of the native but pragmatism is the only way forward
most of us share the same existential concern with going extinct and being replaced at home
i wanted to help natives mine their land the right way to build real wealth for them, but our govt will not give them the mineral rights under their own land (you do the math there)
nothing is more annoying than mexicans pretending like the have any business in the southwest us when the retarded spics weren’t ever successful breaching the apache

Vidya was great in the '80s and '90s because the games were created by Japs and White men who just wanted to make fun products for consumers. Once the industry got taken over by globohomo conglomerates, it became all about maximizing profits and meeting DEI quotas. Video games stopped being passion projects and instead became soulless money grabs designed by women and trannies pushing an agenda.

as i said, he's going to nuke himself... i feel it in me bones:
>As Republicans begin developing lines of attack against Vice President Kamala Harris, many on Team Trump worry that those on their side—including Trump himself—will make disparaging comments about Harris’s identity, alienating key voters.

>On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that Trump’s allies believe attacks on Harris’s political record are more effective than personal insults, but “they also worry that Trump and some of his more extreme supporters will be unable to refrain from deploying sexist and racially fraught language, which they fear will hurt him with crucial voting blocs.”

>A source “familiar with the Trump campaign’s thinking” who spoke with the Post “on the condition of anonymity to share candid views,” seemed to think that it’s all but inevitable that Trump will make problematic comments toward Harris. “We hope he doesn’t act like a crazy racist and sexist person, but we can’t control him,” the source said. “There are probably dog whistles and racist and sexist tropes he’ll stumble into. His campaign is going to try to keep him out of that rhetoric, but it’s going to be difficult.”

This isn’t the first time that Republicans have fretted about the bigotry in their own ranks affecting their electoral prospects. Last week, Politico reported that leading House Republicans had to tell “lawmakers to focus on criticizing [Harris’s] record without reference to her race and gender,” following “a series of comments by their members that focused on Harris’ race as well as claims she is a ‘DEI’ pick.”

>Over the weekend, several Republican lawmakers and Black Trump supporters told Reuters they worried about “demeaning racist and sexist attacks” and “whether the onslaught could harm Republicans at the ballot box.”

Yes fren, burgerland DEI mutt troops said that it was scary being fired at like, and they weren't used to ever getting attacked like that, let alone that hard.

Both sides are jewish apes:

Lastly, President Kennedy began to end the Vatican's hoax known as "the Cold War," the American CIA and Russian KGB having secretly worked together since World War II. He also began to end that Jesuit Inquisition in Vietnam, as its future highpoint would be "Operation Phoenix," the CIA mass-murder of 60,000 Vietnamese, "in cold blood" according to its Opus Dei Director, William E. Colby.

The President interfering with Rome's Holy Office of the Inquisition could not be tolerated! Millions of "infidel" Buddhists were to be exterminated, the Pope's International Drug Trade would explode, American patriotism and liberty would further be destroyed and Vietnam would be reunited under Ho Chi Minh— another communist military dictator loyal to the Pope— like Stalin, like Chairman Mao, like Castro, like George H. W. Bush and son. Waged under the guise of opposing the communist empire's "domino effect," Cardinal Spellman championed America's most disastrous conflict known as "Spelly's War" overseen by Spelly's General, the Roman Catholic and CFR member, William C. Westmoreland. (Remember, according to Col. L. Fletcher Prouty in his JFK, the forced movement of over 660,000 Roman Catholics on U.S. Navy transport vessels from North Vietnam into South Vietnam was "one of the root causes of the Vietnam War." The arch-Catholic Secretary of the Navy responsible for implementing that Jesuit-agitation was the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Francis P. Matthews. Knight Matthew's Master was America's "Military Vicar," Francis Cardinal Spellman.

Later, Spellman made several visits to the war-front calling the American troops "the soldiers of Christ," fighting the Pope's Crusade against "godless Jew Communism!") The outcome was 58,000 dead, 130,000 post-war suicides and a 500 billion-dollar debt to the Jesuits' Federal Reserve Bank.

Reasons they bring back Trump:
1.They can get dumb white goyim to die in a war for him
2.Tricking goyim into believing that voting is real
3.The left needs Trump
4.He could be a fall guy for an economy rugpull.
5.Prop up economy BEFORE the rugpull

>She did good stuff for housing, got Californians $25 million deal after going for mortgage services companies and pinning them for the fraud they committed. It reduced debt by $12 billion dollars for homeowners.

>She pushed for the legislation that requires body cameras for cops.

>Shut down for -profit colleges (that’s based, they’re all scams).

>She originally focused on sex criminals, drug traffickers, and gang violence and she gave them harsh sentences that most dems seem to be allergic to nowadays.

>And the weed stuff I don’t think is a fair attack- she implemented a system that would allow first time drug offenders to complete a program which would allow your charges to be dismissed. Weed was illegal at the time so is she just not supposed to her job?

>She put in a truancy legislation that lessened the offense of truancy to a misdemeanor and it worked, school attendance saw a rise.

When you call her a DEI candidate you piss off every black woman who had to work for her spot. Great strategy, fucking retard. Kamala achieved so much more compared to Trump who's marquis legislation was tax cuts for billionares. No infrastructure bill... that was Biden and Harris.

So keep calling her a "DEI" candidate to play to your base while alienating the demographics you need to improve on lol.

I'm the 6%. I got hired at Chase for software engineering. The ENTIRE staff is Indian, I'm not joking. The only other white person was a woman recruiter. I mean the Indians themselves I work with LOVE white people, they just use the Jewwy DEI system to their advantage. But trust me fellow white men, you aren't missing anything. These companies are controlling as hell. Psychos required my damn fingerprints to hire me. I wish I was joking...

Lesson for white men: YOU have to control the rules. START YOUR OWN COMPANY INSTEAD!!! Or work for a smaller company owned by a based white man you trust. In many cases they probably pay better. These top 500 companies are going completely insane with control.

Affirmative Action was created by White liberals to make a way to hire Myronius McDunce just because he was brown while telling "over qualified" Black men to take a hike. With AA it made the White liberals look as if they were being 'forced' to hire Blacks but they made sure to never hire the competent ones. AA was never about giving jobs to Blacks over Whites, it was about White liberals making sure competent Blacks couldn't get work and to keep Blacks from having economically sound communities again--the same White liberals pushed illegal immigration from Mexico and mass Asian immigration for the same reason.

Admin literally does not care. You cannot be proactive. They have to literally kill someone and then they get thrown under the bus. They still need bodies with licenses to generate profits and they have DEI metrics to meet. The absolute shit I've seen I could write a series of books about. One race-card playing nurse literally sat in front of a patient who developed classic facial drooping and never called a code Stroke, the nurse sitting next to her did once they saw what this nurse had been staring at for God knows how long.

kikes. And all these policies you say are "controversial" in the US (critical race theory, DEI, AA, LGBT, censorship of rightwing, etc.) are actually championed by the US.
The United States isn't what your feelings tell you it is. It is a reflection of its actions, which is to enforce globalism, zionism, wokeism, unchecked capitalism, imperialism, atheism, widespread miscegenation (no surprises there, since US citizens are mullattoes).

95% of the things you call "leftism" are just "American social politics" and are neither left nor rightwing. Its just american kikery that you people slurp up from the ground and beg daddy Israel for more.

Total success, people now refuse to get into a new game if even a hint of DEI is in it. They check the discussion tab on steam and even go to the dev website and twitter to find if there's gay flags and other trash. It's really fun to find a new game and checking the topics, usually there's a locked one asking if the game is woke it's hilarious to see the devs seethe.

Yep. I just figured most would not understand. He is DEI. Take money from people who work, give it to pet poorfags, pet niggers, etc, etc, get them to a university, train them into the system, tell them they can make a lot of money if they are the face of the poor white man for gay billionaires, like how Rhodes scholarships brought token system tools to Oxford to indoctrinate and return to their community and be a familiar face representing Rothschild globalism as it ate them alive.

Lulz. He doesn't care about white babies. He is a faggot in a sham marriage to a poo in loo. He is a disciple of a faggot and a Chinese woman. He wants people like his mom, who fucked so many dudes that JD can't remember them all to get to vote - a literal junkie welfare queen - or his dad, who dropped a nut and left after a few years. He's had so little connection to his parents that he changes his name every other week. But white people who delay having kids so they can be ready? Wait for marriage? Perhaps even practice abstinence until married? You need to wait to vote. Even if you are paying for DEI hires and people like Vance whose parents are fucking trash to go to school with your taxes. Bring in Lakeisha! Seven kids, seven votes - pick up your welfare check while you vote. His "charity" for white people never did anything but siphon money to an Indian man that used to work for Kasich. He called Trump an American Hitler, but Trump made him VP with a big fat check from a German faggot. He does not give a fuck about white people, and he will drag down Trump like a stone, and then flip flop back to his old role.
Your grandchildren will be brown, courtesy of JD Vance and his silicon valley daddy.

So since we're talking about the secret service and Kamala Harris, I'd like to point out that Jill Biden has over the years often used the SS to fuck with Harris in hilarious ways, for example they assigned a literal schizo DEI hire to her staff who pelted Harris and other agents with used tampons. This agent was not fired after this, she didn't get fired until she physically attacked another agent on duty in front of Harris, who was reportedly terrified.
>https://nypost.com/2024/04/30/us-news/kamala-harris-secret-service-agent-had-screws-loose-ex-colleague/

So yeah, that's how Jill Biden uses the SS, to fuck with people, as she did with Trump as well. Also this might explain why Harris is eager to fire most of Biden's staff lol.

Nothing in the DEI games is coherent. It's all Unreal Engine jank that are all basically Mass Effect: Andromeda bad.

A decade ago the normie would still be eating up the slop because then, the games were mostly playable unless you were on PC though the problem then was mostly gatcha shit and the finished game cut up into DLC (not really, it was on the disk, the "DLC" was just a decryption key to give you access to the locked files). God bless Batman forcing Valve to implement refunds.
A game with a bad story 10-15 years ago was still fun to play if there even was a story, games then were still mostly wacky woohoo arcade shit instead of trying to be Marvel capeshit slop.

The issues are long commutes due to lack of affordable housing near the offices, plus traffic mismanagement due to combination of incompetent city planners and Google Maps (Google Maps has been devastating from civil engineering perspective as it will try to reroute traffic in ways the city planners never intended).
But the biggest problem isnt the system itself. The idea of willingly put yourself into 40 hour/week wageslavery in exchange for your needs isn't necessarily a bad deal.
The problem is that the system no longer provides. Women are whores. It's hard to start a family. It's hard to afford a house. DEI has brought in systemic injustices. Merit doesn't mean shit anymore. If you are white male you will get the hard work and be expected to be the cornerstone holding the department or company together. If you are a bossgirl you get cozy middle management job where you send a couple emails a day and sit in Teams all day and make more money than the white men doing the actual work. The other diverse hires aren't expected to output nearly the same level as the white man is.
The work itself, office work, is demoralizing and unsatisfying. If you look at movies in late 90s you see a theme about that, fight club, office space, the matrix, etc. ton of movies about the soullessness of working in an office. But at least in the 90s the system still provided. In Fight Club he still got material things and opportunities at family, even if the lifestyle itself was depressing. Today that system doesn't even offer those.
You have low trust schools in low trust neighborhoods, doctors who promoted a COVID hoax and just want to sell pills, teachers who will try to Troon out your kids, seed oils and poisons in your food and water and a populace that is encouraged to hate you.

In fact throwing money at problems can never solve problems since it makes the existence of the problem profitable, and this incentivizes perpetuation of the problem. This is also why monetary aid to shithole countries doesn't fix those countries.

Everyone on the "naive left" understands that it's better to feed the homeless than to give them money, but for some reason they can't see how public funding has the same dynamic. Private "consulting" and "training" groups are the institutional equivalent of drug dealers. Throwing money at dysfunctional organizations instead of giving them the things they need just leads to all of that public money being sucked up by these parasitic private groups. The entire "diversity economy" is built on this. The reason groups like BlackRock care so much about DEI is because it's such an effective way to move public money into private hands. If every public organization is demanding more funding but spending that funding on $100000 per session diversity consulting then public services will balloon in cost while stagnating in quality. The "hardcore left" know all of this though, they only care about collapsing society and pushing critical theory bullshit so they have no incentive to stop it, but the naive left would be outraged if they understood how this aspect of the system works.

Ideology is so powerful because correct speech and correct thought are easy to learn. It's much easier to become an expert on some ideological dogma than to learn hard skills. Then you can speak from a position of authority despite not really knowing anything at all.. just throw in jargon e.g.

>it is a kind of orthographic injustice to lowercase the B: to do so is to perpetuate the iniquity of an institution that uprooted people from the most ethnically diverse place on the planet, systematically obliterating any and all distinctions regarding ethnicity and culture.

Note: orthographic, perpetuate, iniquity, institution (incorrect usage), systematically.

If you want to sound smart say something like.. our firm should be conscious of not perpetuating systematic racism and seek to elevate black, brown, and indigenous voices within the context of an inclusive framework.... Utter word salad nonsense, but you can receive your DEI salary for it.

this, and part of that is:

- american fast food used to be staffed by white high schoolers earning money to help their family or have pocket cash, white college students putting themselves through school, and a white 30+ y.o. manager trying to bang the teens. they were learning responsibility and getting work experience, but it wasn't meant to be a career for most. it wasn't perfect; sometimes you'd get a wrong item or someone else's order in the drive-thru (mostly from drive aways), and the food was never "great" compared to a fancy restaurant or good home cooked, but it was quick and cheap and the place was clean.

- now, it's all DEIs - DEI staff and DEI management; if you see a white person, they are over-the-hill with sleeve tats. this is no stepping stone to anything besides an unemployment check, this is their career. a dead-end career for a dead-end life. and they hate it, rightfully so.
they don't care if the bathrooms are clean, because their bathroom at home is filthy.
they don't care if the shake or soda machine is broken, because everything they own is broken.
they don't care if they run out of supplies or ingredients, because their souls are empty.
they don't care if your order's wrong, because everything in their life has gone wrong, too.
they don't care if your order tastes like shit, because they are shit.

even rural fast food, which through the '90s and early 2000s still had a '50s timewarp feel of polite quaintness, has now been ruined, because DEIs can move to a rural area, globohomo has to hire them, then they can get fired fired and collect welfare, destroying your formerly nice town with all of their government sponsored paid free time.

It's older, our society is the only one where women have had this much political power, as such their relationship warfare tactics of Gossip, Shaming and Rallying. They speak in double meanings and attack status to harm reputations in the group over things that guys dont care about. Every thing in society works by it now.
Autists cant get laid, no sucess with women because they where told to treat them equally and they took it literally.
ESG, DEI, Bridge or whatever they rename it too, feelings over facts, women.
Advertising is overwhelmingly aimed towards women, they fall for it more often and are bigger spenders, their life depends on fitting in and doing what they're expected to do in a group. As opposed to guys, whose groups will tolerate alot of oddities as long as they work well for an objective.
This is reduced at times when they have kids, they dont have to worry as much about their reproductive future, it doesn't depend on what's innane and petty shit to mens perspectives, the husband doesn't care much about the harpies, their focus is on making the family stable. they only social warfare they have to worry about are attacks on the family.

I find it hilarious that the Right has been so slow to figure this out. He's a lifelong Democrat that grifted his way into the Presidency. He's by no means a conservative, nor does he care about anything conservative. He had the incredible fortune of going against the worst candidate in history in 2016, and now will have the chance to go against a DEI disaster in 2024. Put him against an actual Democrat like JFK, Bill Clinton, etc. who had genuine support, then he'd lose in an instant.

Well if it helps at all, from my vantage point I don’t think a lot of rape babies even have souls. So they could be aborted, technically speaking.

And cue the Christians exploding in anger. Ok, do you all really think that in the hypothetical case your daughter got raped by some animal thug, that the child would be a product of love and goodness? Or that it would be automatically endowed with a soul?

C’mon now.

>Same religion as mutt Tate.

The stabber was also aided, elevated and funded by the same people as Tate, that's why actors like Tate will never point people to the passages in the Torah that specifically call for Nations to be destroyed by mass migration and the artificial elevation and promotion of hostile foreigners (DEI), this is Judaism in action and Tate knows it.


The Irish people are under attack from an extremist Bible cult. The Torah contains a list of "Hebrew Curses" that must be inflicted on "disobedient goyim/nations". These curses are being inflicted on the Irish people right now. Confront your politicians, celebrities and influencers with these passages and make them answer for supporting them. They want the Irish people to fight the hostile foreigners they are flooding Ireland with. Zionist openly state that the Torah is their manifesto, everything in Torah must come to pass. Ask your zionists and their bolshevik allies "Do you support the genocidal religious beliefs of chabad?". Their answer will let you know what they actually think of the Irish people. Chabad and their supporters seek the TOTAL genocide of the Irish people, anyone supporting chabad is a Judas goat.

I agree with the jew here. It's a really bad play. Majority of Americans support the ideas trump supports. Falling them weird is the same as calling those Americans weird. Weird is a word used to distance yourself from another. It makes the Dems look out of touch. Biden didn't try to compete against trump by calling him weird he tried to compete by being Scranton Joe and appear more relatable to old white boomers. Already have a DEI "black"/woman candidate, you need to try to make her MORE relatable not LESS. That's how Obama won. By trying to appear relatable to whites.

In conservative minds society has clearly defined in groups and out groups.

White make Christian - IN

LGBTQ - out

Immigrants minorities, atheists, liberals women etc…. - OUT.

Woke means pay attention (like be awake/aware) to how the out groups are treated by society. Blacks coined the term 50+ years ago. Stay woke was the term. it’s bastardized now.

But conservatives hate it because it boils down to be accepting of everyone in society, and the only recognize their in group as a legitimate part of society.

This is why the hate DEI initiatives, as only white Christian males should run American culture. They know they’re losing, this is pretty much their last stand.

They are also more notably caught for sex crimes, immoral and scandalous acts and have a higher tendency for abusing children. Alt right conservatives are weird creeps with skeletons in their closet. It is all projection

Booked some empathy towards LGBTQ+ training recently to prove to our clients that we are an inclusive business, we also have culture groups for Black, Latinos, and Asians. We give them money to spend at non-white businesses as long as they take pictures for social media.
Despite the economy appearing unhealthy we’ve adapted to the current morays of the business environment and have been rewarded, expanding no less than 20% yoy since rebounding from the COVID lay offs in 2022.

I'm 100% against all this stuff. I just don't think it is the primary ill we are facing in our relations with eachother. Definitely does not help. Our civilization is being systematically torn apart. We need to do something deeper than complain about DEI. It's a symptom.

Regardless, when you handicap white men's earning potential through state sanctioned discrimination, you will end up with a lot of deeply demoralized white men who are unable to get anywhere career-wise while their female counterparts breeze past them on diversity checklists
Its unfair on a deep, fundamental level, the same way that race-based DEI is unfair, because they both assume that the disparities in outcomes between groups is due to some structural oppression rather than just a natural outcome

Okay, that's a pretty reasonable point to make. Though I would add onto this that hypergamy (in the original meaning, not the redpill nonsense) is another huge factor
Women will choose a man who is higher in social status and income to a far greater degree than men would, and this is why forced equality of outcomes via DEI hiring is a disaster for the relations between the sexes
And as far as men are concerned, the housework stuff is a distant second to the sexual depravity that the average man has allowed himself to fall into
When I look at what women complain about amongst themselves, by far the biggest problem they have is porn addiction, bizarre sexual interests, and inability to control their lust
If we are going to go about fixing men, the sexual issues are much more pressing than housework imo

I was born in a post-communist country and my parents were born in communism.
They are mostly better off without it.

The only reason Soviet Union actually functioned to a degree was thanks to the limitless resources it had.
People had jobs, kids went to school and you could go to university.
But if you wanted literally anything which did not involve living like a communist npc drone was forbidden.

Up until the communist DEI lovers started to subvert boeing, they made the best planes in the world with the best cost/quality ratio.

I agree that Boeing should not be doing space operations since SpaceX already does everything 10 times better.

Gen Z are hysterical like cat ladies. They are going to sabotage any legit criticism of mr. Beast by overblowing shit nobody older than 30 cares about. Then they will cry wolf and turn themselves into clowns easily clowned on when it comes time to fire up the mr. Beast for president propaganda machine. Reminder that he isn't eligible until 2036--that's a long ass time.

Honestly my own schizo theory is all of this beast slander is kike on kike shadow puppet wars between egomaniacs. Who is the king kike egomaniac who sees themselves as the leader of a generation and is putting forth time, effort, and money into becoming a ruler? Zucc. I legit think this is a botted Zucc cultural defamation push to attempt to assassinate a potential threat.

It's not going to work though. The beast's core fanbase is 8-12. He will have the support of the "visually attractive" portion of the population in 12 years. The only value youth has is beauty for optics but it is a significant power that should not be underestimated. Women in particular are easily swayed by voting for the candidate they feel makes them a member of the group that is more attractive. That's why hollywood kikes were so important in the past to be loud with their politcal views to sell an image. Too bad they erased that very real power as a casualty of DEI. Turns out moralfagging cred is less effective than beauty cred. It's a simple calculus--in anonymity 95/100 people desire to be perceived as attractive rather than to be perceived as righteous. Vanity is a much stronger desire than selflessness.

DEI is horrible. Harold Robertson's famous article in Palladium made a strong and persuasive case. Lately, though, I have been more interested in how and why non-diverse candidates don't perform well either. Everyone I work with is like that. They're disillusioned and demotivated, understandably. I think there's another side to the competence crisis which doesn't get nearly as much attention -- namely, nihilism. Whether you want to attribute that to DEI, modernity, social media, rampant corruption, whatever -- I think if we fail to address the competence crisis from both sides (i.e. that which can be corrected with policy and that which must be healed culturally since its of an inner and psychic nature and thus unresponsive to policy) then the problem before us won't truly go away.

Truly, sorry to hear about Airbus as well. I'd expect much higher ethical standards from a European company, especially one as prolific as Airbus. Guess greed is too alluring for the financial jews at the top of the ladder. Glad to hear you've gotten out of that though.

Intel is an otherwise great company that has set high standards for itself internally but has fallen victim to the predations of corporate raider shareholder types, as well as the DEI/ESG money virus. At this point im convinced that any major firm that runs this planet is essentially compromised by the disease at this point and wont change until the next chapter of history passes (or we eat these financefags before then)

If you live in a place like NYC that's unironically a good thing, scumbag drivers make the city objectively worse. I guess you rural folk can keep them as long as they get 35mpg average or better but you don't need a pickup truck because climate change is a problem that affects everyone.

Yeah, they are used to kill people and serve no other legitimate purposes. Unless you intend to shoot up an ice cream shop, there is no purpose to possessing an assault rifle.

>mandatory mRNA vaccines
It's necessary for the group to be protected, especially in large metropolitan areas. Ben Franklin once said an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of the cure. You antivaxxers don't get the right to clog up our medical system for a simple, safe, and effective treatment.

>open borders, climate lockdowns, 15 minute cities, rampant crime, unaffordable housing, inflation, $8.00 a gallon gasoline, and World War III
This just sounds like chud typical bullshit although I agree with the gas one so that should be true if it gets Americans to stop driving oversized SUVs/pickups and sport cars. Otherwise we believe that immigration should be restricted but legal immigration amounts should be increased. Climate lockdowns no but policies to incentivize good carbon behavior are a must. Not sure what a 15 minute city is and why you think Dems outright support crime. Housing is unaffordable because everyone wants to live in cities like NY, Miami, Boston, Austin, etc and there is limited real estate. Why would Dems want WW3, that's usually a neocon desire.

Yep. I believe we have seen any sort of pretence/manners tossed out the window here. The memes are god-awful and extremely desperate. Instantly laughable. The DNC "e-force" has nothing to work with. Trump was literally saved by the hand of God and Kamala is a slut who slept her way into politics and got a DEI appointment as Senator and Vice President. She's off-putting and people dislike her. She's a bad speaker and not very intelligent. Plus, let's be honest: nobody wants a female president. Female "leaders" are usually laughter-evoking

Oh yeah, no more DEI in the military, no more multiple gender records.

I have no doubt that the map cam look like that in November and that Kamala will "win." I just don't think it will be because she legitimately won more votes.

It will mostly be because the ruling class need to gaslight the population into believing that the majority of Americans want DEI, Lgbtqia+ shit shoved in their faces, personal automobiles outlawed, gun confiscation, mandatory mRNA vaccines, open borders, climate lockdowns, 15 minute cities, rampant crime, unaffordable housing, inflation, $8.00 a gallon gasoline, and World War III -- and if they're against it, then they're a crazy fringe extremist in the minority of the country's population

Yeah, the DNC is also trying to do that, don't be dumb. The GOP with Trump is definitely worth it to ensure the pendulum swings on DEI and we actually get someone who acknowledges the inflation. The RNC convention was fine. The 56% meme isn't a joke, wake up.

When the topic of risking their lives or safety to protect israel came up in the very beginning of the war. The DEI mutt troops revolted, which is a large part as to why the west never truly sent troops to the fight for shitrael.

I haven't watched a movie in theaters or on cable since 1917. That was the the last movie I paid for. I'm just sticking to what I can see for free on Tubi, Pluto, Plex, and other services. I just saw Cruel Intentions, Go, and The Rules of Attraction; I fucking miss those years.

Hey guys. I know we like to have fun here and joke around with the piratebeard shill, retard shills, kikes and in some cases, glowniggers. But I genuinely mean it when I say that all evil kikes, illegals/niggers who rape, murder, steal and traitorous glowniggers, all who enable and are responsible for the problems the world is facing today should face justice. They all need to hang in a public forum for the world to see.
Don't forget to volunteer when operation deport Dora the explorer kicks in when Trump enters his third term. On another note. I expect the glowniggers activate their dei illegals immigrants to cause mass amount of chaos so do keep a sharp eye out and stay safe. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

trannies for absolutely no reason except using a shitty language that only saving grace is to stop idiot coders from making stupid mistakes.
Everything is constantly going towards DEI incompetent stupidity, if you compile something in modern Visual Studio you have to set a fuckton of options first so it will not forcefully vomit all sort of "security" nonsense like stack canaries and flow guard checks that slow the code down just so it can save some jeet who doesn't know what a fucking buffer overflow is.

It is a disgrace, disgusting, and I'm seriously considering changing fields because everything is bullshit nowadays.
Worst thing is that the new breed of coders are extremely opinionated yet they know absolutely nothing about anything.
They started from a high-level language and never even learned the foundational basics, they don't know what a cpu register or an instruction pipeline is, they do not have understanding at fundamental level what is machine code and how to code in such a way that the resulting machine code is as efficient as possible.

WTF is up with this retarded meme that the ceremony parodied the last supper? it was literally "just" a DEI party along a runway for models
I didn't draw any similarities between that performance and the last supper when watching it tipsy on a Friday at all. And when it turned out that the blue weirdo was a representation of Dionysus, it became clear the "body positive" fatty with the sun rays around her head was supposed to be Apollo...

This can't all be christcucks, I'm sure russian/chinese/thirdoid/anti-Western trolls are spinning this demoralization bullshit too and perhaps even initiated this

Trump’s being advised by his coke-addled son, so expect the personal attacks on Harris to ramp up over the next few weeks when she opens up a wider lead. That might have worked against Clinton, because she was dislikable. Harris is largely inoffensive and an unknown quantity. She doesn’t have 30 years of publicly known baggage. If they double down on the ‘childless cat lady’/‘DEI hire’ stuff, then they’ll certainly lose.

Republicans are to blame for nominating one of the most hated men in America. Part of me hopes that this year’s ‘October Surprise’ is a video of him with Jeffrey and Co, just so to see how far MAGA will go to defend him.

I choose to think the real opening ceremony was after the gay shit. The Effel laser show, balloon cauldron and Celine. Yes, there were still niggers, but the execution and audacity were pure French. It may have 90% merde before that, but the last 30mins showed there was still real French gold left to show. The nation of France still has life.

https://youtu.be/smKqMiGXxl4

If it's any consolation, while I don't think a ceremony in the US would go full tranny, I also don't think we could be as iconic either. Mediocrity is the reigning mentality here, and has been long before cuckservatives started blaming everything on DEI or woke. Just look at our secret service lmao

Probably sacrificed to save an incompetent BAME so that the health trust in question doesnt get branded racist and therefore no uppity nigger protests outside hospital etc will happen. Just imagine how you would feel if it was the case that your child died because of some incompetent nigger hiding in an nhs job only because of DEI targets? You would be full of outrage and you would expose that DEI was responsible for killing your child wouldn't you? Then you demand a risk assessment and you demand the true figures of hospital employees who got DEI into jobs they were incapable of doing and you do a calculation on the probability of this occurring again across every health board. Then you would dig and find out how many other incidents happened nationally that were covered up due to the skin colour of the incompetent one. Imagine telephoning the Guardian or BBC to run the story of your findings? Then imagine a high court judge silencing you from releasing your findings via social media when MSM all d-list you & your story from coming into public domain? Imagine the struggle to do all this while ALL the establishment is working full throttle against you as you grieve the loss of your child

They came in on student visas, weren't supposed to work or take welfare or charity, yet mass amounts did both, majority used fake letters to get in, majority used fake diplomas or diplomas bought from diploma mills, most lied about their experience for their jobs and got in any way due to DEI policies, they're used to living in filth and shitting everywhere except the toilet and bring that over here, they have a backwards caste system that put people who clean/do menial labor at the bottom and they all see themselves above that, if you work a fast food or janitorial job they see you as beneath them despite your income being higher than anything they could make in their country ever at their highest "class"

JD Vance is backed by private equity/venture capitalists that speak openly about about hating big banks, monopolies, etc.

Peter Thiel had 2019 making headlines about 'considering' Google to be treasonous for their China operations.

They plan to put some actual teeth in this lame duck anti-trust effort by the current DoJ and at least knock a few branches off the Google monopoly, maybe a bank

Mark Andreesen and Peter Thiel speak about it openly.

You can get some of that list, but if the kike stuff is really important to you, then you don't have any options. Kamala will be another cabinet of investment bank lawyers and corporate bureaucrats

Tech companies haven't always been servants of purple hair nose ring freaks. As Silicon Valley continues to fall apart and move into midwestern states that shit will start go erode. Especially with BlackRock's ESG/DEI bullshit is getting weaker by the day

Christkikes see whites being persecuted and are still too pussy and gay to make it about race so they say it's because they're "Christians" even though DEI and affirmative action is explicitly racial. Christkikes are cowards.

And its not about them being adults and not schooled properly in their lands of origin - nonwhites born here are just the same.
In fact we used to be #1 in PISA (multi-discipline test of intelligence and skill of schoolkids) in early 2000s when we still were like 98% White, but the mass flood of nonwhites has dropped it like a rock and no end in sight to the downfall.
Our schools unfortunately aren't segregated so they are now bringing down even the White kids because the schools have to adapt to the nonwhite much lower intelligence.
This has lead to the situation that even in Whites Millennials were the last generation to always be smarter than the earlier one.
In any case, the Whites still manage or at least have managed until now and highscools and universities dont have any DEI shit (yet) and they are entirely merit-based, best scores get in, which make best schools obviously all White.
So whether they were born and educated here or come here as young adults, it doesn't really matter, IQ is largely genetic.
Only nations with high IQ can create high-skill industries.
African average IQ is 80 which is literally retarded in a White person.
So of course the idea that you bring in bunch of retards and except them to work in biotech is of course laughable - but the Jew doesn't care he can just push more propaganda until people believe it makes sense 'all races are equal' remember.

Quoted By: >>475959793
>>475954939
That image is made by a nonwhite 100% because it's making dishonest arguments about 'preventing industrialization' 'muh oppression' type nigger-cope.
The truth is that they can't industrialize due to their race.
Not all nonwhite countries were bombed by the Jews, nothing is preventing them from industrializing except themselves.
(Sand)niggers simply lack the IQ necessary to create any sort of high-skill production.
When they come to our countries where these industries already exist - built by us, they can't work these jobs.
They are only fit for low-skill jobs.
That is why many of them end up unemployed no matter how much all sorts of programs you throw at them, because you can't make race of people more intelligent.
Especially our societies in Nordics with no natural resources to speak of are entirely based around highly intelligent highly educated high-skill workforce and the high-value added industries around it.
The nonwhites simply can't work those jobs and never will, they will never get into universities without DEI programs and anywhere else without lowering the intelligence bars.
There are only so many low-skill jobs to go around and you cant have an economy based on uber jeets so they end up unemployed.
That is why all the "lets bring in workers" is bullshit because they cant work the jobs we have.

Another thing completely wrong in that image is that the regime-change wars in ME had anything to do with China, it was completely done on solely Israel's behalf, miles of leaks and documents exist to attest to this fact.
It is not a debate, those wars were ENTIRELY jewish.
A QRD can be seen by watching the video series in >>475951062 , it touches on the Iraq war, also I mentioned about the Jewish need to take down Ba'athists (Syria/Iraq/Libya) in >>475950328 which Jews got 2/3 except Russia saved Syria.

Borders are DEI for white people.

As an Indian in tech, I can tell you talent is lacking in the white population. I've seen it in interview after interview, white candidates struggling to solve problems that Indians have no trouble with.

You are going to have to face facts: the era of white people enjoying lives of unearned luxury in the West has come to a close. You simply cannot compete in a global labor market with elite human capital like many of us Indians.

I've spoken with J.D. about this very subject, and he agrees wholeheartedly. Listen to this podcast to get the straight facts on immigration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYZulgzuGQQ

There’s a massive shill campaign for Kamala.
You have democrats that aren’t happy about someone just being “appointed” as the democratic nominee. Berniesisters, despite being cucks, are still salty and this is just blatantly fucked. Dems have a short window to get everyone in line. They’re also trying to secure the gen z vote with the most cringe worthy memes. Kamala is a fucking retard, and “DEI Hire” has been trending. She’s seen as unqualified, stupid, mean and power hungry. Joe Biden wasn’t supposed to shit the bed and his pants this hard. They would rather have Joe because he can secure the boomer vote. There’s a lot of gay ass retard boomers that only watch the news and think Trump is a radical right wing Nazi. Remember Nazi = Bad, Trump & MAGA = Nazi, Blue = Good, Red = Bad!
So why is /pol/ being astroturfed? They want to frustrate any space where DJT can gain traction. They know they’re not going to change the mind of anyone here, they just don’t want the other side to. /POL/ didn’t win the 2016 election but it helped create memes that went into the normiesphere.

I believe we're doomed if anything huge starts, but if we're gonna fight locally, I still think we're better than most ex-yu nations. The problem is, we won't be fighting locally, and NATO is itching to make itself relevant again, especially after they lose Ukraine and Taiwan, we will be a prime target again

I'm kinda the same way. I've held a job for 4 years max, but checked out of society about 9 years ago. It's hard faking being a normie when you're a hardcore introvert since birth. It's exhausting, actually. I might be looking for a lowkey job in the coming months just to get some cash in my pocket, but nothing too stressful. I reckon it will be difficult considering I'm a straight white male who's been a hardcore NEET for almost a decade. Hearing about all this DEI shit is demoralizing; I've been out of the loop for so long, the current work environment seems alien to me now.

It's one or two.
1) DNC didn't want to spend money on a primary. The longer they withhold their real candidate the less the GOP can dismantle them in the public sphere. They're hoping they can ram their candidate through before voters wise up to how shit they are.
2) Their base is dead from the vaccines. They'll use Kamala to push their worse platforms and bomb out of the race. Then completely do a 180 on DEI, trannies, immigration, etc. Zoomers are more conservative than Boomers and they can't endlessly spend money to prop up their voice with bots. So they'll pivot to capture the market before the next great awakening.

Bullshit you stupid fucking jew or boomer (same thing, spiritually). This is a great lie and one of the biggest lies of our time that men are waking up to. It NEVER was "get the job, get the house, then get the girl". It was "get the girl, get the family, now you have reason to get the job and house". Boomers married their HS sweethearts long before they had a good job. Generations prior as well married young and poor.
The brainwashing is wearing off as many men in their 30s wake up to the reality that despite their six figure income, who did what the boomers told them to do, they still can't find a woman. Because the root cause is feminism/hypergamy not employment.
NEET coincides with NPNW. And it's not a movement it's natural reaction. Men who have no family have no reason to work hard for a system that hates them. The boomer system was "just be a good goy slave and we will provide the rest!" - perhaps an acceptable deal in the past. But now, it clearly isnt. So the men, especially white men who are most affected by Jewish nonsense like DEI, feminism and mass migration, are dropping out. Dropping out into welfare by taking advantage of SSDI, dropping out of the military, or simply dropping out by "quiet quitting".
This trend isn't going to be reversed any time soon. The end result is going to be Israel wiped off the fucking map and a collapsed Western society that could maybe be rebuilt by the remaining white men WITHOUT your filthy parasitic jewry. Neets will inherit the earth.

Schitzos said the same thing about Brandon in 2020 ("he will lose but they will blatantly cheat to make it look like he won so they can start a civil war and enact martial law/nwo/etc"), but it literally never happened. Stop larping.

Even if it was true it wouldn't work - people don't give a shit about anything anymore, dude. The Secret fucking Service just tried to kill a former President who is running for office again like a week and a half ago and no one is even talking about it anymore. If this would have happened in the 90s to Bush Sr. or Clinton it would have been the top story on every news network for months. There would be a massive investigation, endless hearings, it would have been insane.

What did we get? We got a few days on Fox News and a handful of congresspeople yelling at a literal for reals retarded DEI checkbox hire who somehow got a job leading the Secret Service even though her previous experience amounted to handling security for Pepsi. The best part is she resigned and now will face absolutely zero consequences. Can you imagine that? Taking part in a plot to kill a former president and the only thing that happens when it all goes lear shaped and you get caught is you have to quit your job? Fucking A.

Everyone is so busy struggling with their own shit that they just stopped caring about the fact that we are literally living through a new chapter in a future history textbook every couple of months.

The normie awakening has begun, with even some boomers undergoing the noticing. Once seen, it cannot be unseen, and yo can never look at shitrael the same way ever again. Israel and jew's entire decline is special thanks to yahoo himself. As he cares more about self preservation, than he does about israel or any jews globally. Doing more in the first 3 months of the war, than 75-80 years of EVERY anti-jew group globally combined, let alone the damage done in 9 months 3 weeks
> He'll let israel burn, as long as it keeps him in power a bit longer, and as long as it keeps his many felony criminal trials paused. As he knows once the war ends, he loses office. When that happens, his trials continue, he gets convicted via countless evidence, and then harshly prosecuted due to both the evidence & everyone in pissrael despising him

Things don't look too good for israel, but they had already planned for this 6 years ago, when they put boots on the ground in ukraine. To setup their plan B exit strategy, in case they needed to flee from israel to khazaria. aka. New Jerusalem, which will be the bottom/coastal half of ukraine, setup just like Palestine was converted into israel
> Which is why they neded to kill off the goyim first, or get them to flee. So they don't get another Palestine on their hands

I'm not familiar with that.

You rhetoric is verging too close to the kikery hatred of goys, imho, fren. If what you say is true, the difference between you and kikes is that they don't acknowledge you as a fellow human. having never met you personally, they'd judge you based on generalizations and peg you as a NPC. An honest mistake. Clown world is justified. I think the big leap of Christianity was that everyone is a child loved by God that can be saved from being a stupid NPC. Again, in my distorted misunderstanding of history (which is mostly fake and gay anyway).

>Then why God make such and such?
My understanding is that we are but small kids, and kids will never understand why adults don't eat candy and play up late all day. God knows why He does what He does, even if makes zero sense to us down here in the playpen.

>>475927338
I'm not questioning they did those things. I'm not question they did those things after receiving the Holy Spirit. I'm saying maybe the power to do such and the receiving of the Holy Ghost were distinct things that happen on the same time. They made miracles for the same reason every Saint made miracles: because God was pointing His finger (hic est digitus dei or smth like that) and telling everyone "look here, this is not human doing, but God". And what He was ṕointing to, imho, is that it is possible to take a bunch of npc fishermen and tax collctors and make them into thinking non NPCs.

1) Just because they are asking for X years of experience does not mean that they are requiring X years of experience. Apply anyways dumbass.

2) You can just put your other work experience with transferable skills down for experience. If you mopped the toilets at McDonalds you can put that down as work experience applying for a plumber.

3) Many places put that they are hiring when they are not in fact hiring.

4) Your application may be ignored for DEI (Affirmative Action) Racism / Sexism against you for being white / male. Not much you can do about this one except vote Democrats out of power.

I’d be frustrated by this too, it’s the fault of your HR department. White zoomer males are competent (like most white males) and we have the added benefit of having grown up with this tech. I got hired three months after a zoomer mulatto DEI nigger and lapped him in output statistics within 2 months.

Guys, we are going to have the best gender discussion and research like ever, we are going to explore and write endless books about it, make tv shows and we are going to celebrate every da gender stuff and Division, I mean diversity... like non stop, we will make it part of daily life because we will be best at it.

The world can shrug and laugh and be doctors, specialist, strive to build, mantain, develope, unite, cooperate and advance... In tangable useful spheres, we will carry on with dei, diversity division and gender discussion, we will sit on the stairs as collective in our fifteen minute cities after eating worms in our pods and talk about dicks and vaginas, the ones in our pants and skirts and the ones in our brains minds and so on... we are going to Thrive!

We are going to depopulate and genocide ourselves only and nations, we will thrive afterwards culturally, we will be glorious and magnificent, we will do it all, and we will also have civil war and like ten external wars and win the all!

Not always, sometimes departments know they don't have any quality people (due to DEI) and have a high skill high responsibility job that they want a white man for. White men can apply for those jobs and get hired, but they will be expected to do all the work no one else is doing, they are the Atlas holding up the department/company.
It's the high paying, make-work middle managers jobs that always go to friends or DEI quotas.
That's why views of the economy in the US are so split. If you are a shitskin with any skill at all, or a roastie bossgirl, you can sleepwalk into a $100K work from home job where you just send a couple emails a day. Economy seems great to them.
If you are a White man, you have to bust your ass to get an $70K job and do all the actual work that needs done, just to see others who do less get more.

It is one hundred percent going to be a white guy. DEI comes full circle I guess? Now we have “this spot has to be a white guy” openly talked about. Hell one of the mainstream news sites had an article “the white guy buffet Kamala will choose from” something like that.

It's literally a conservative version of what the left already had put in place. They've used it to spread wokeness, DEI, LBGQT+ nonsense, to harbor child molestors, human traffickers, a corrupt government, media, education and justice system, etc.
I'm not worried about the conservative version if it does the opposite and suppresses that scum. I'm FOR IT! Sign me up baby. Add RICO charges for the entire party for treason, grooming Crooks, allowing him the perfect opportunity and the layout to get it done. I'm forgiving or forgetting.

The only way to get into a company now if you're a white male unconfused about his genitals is through acquihire. As part of the deal, you'll be expected to work at the company for some duration, often two years. Make part of the agreement that you will not be required to participate in any of the HR shit. If they won't exempt you, there's no deal.
The alternative to working in a company is to do consulting. Companies have work that needs to be done which means they often have to hire consultants to do what their DEI employees should be capable of doing. Be sure your contract specifies a 10X rate for any HR required tasks. HR roasties love to tell consultants that they must go through the company's DEI training and most cower and do it, not even billing for the time because they're scared of losing their contract. Explicitly state in your contract that you will not attend any HR required course for free. Once you put a 10X price on it, HR backs off once they realize it would come out of their budget.
Best alternative is to start up a small business where you work with the end users of your service or product directly. I know a guy who builds decks on houses. That's all he does. No sheds. No houses. Nothing but decks. He's not wealthy but it's a good middle class life.

Pence was supposed to "balance Trump out" insofar as his mild temperament.

Vance is supposed to appeal to younger voters.

Both of Trump's VP picks are supposed to appeal to Midwestern voters.

By the way: Everyone who isn't a fucking bigot with an IQ higher than a can of cling peaches knows that the phrase "DEI hire" used as a pejorative is a dog whistle for racism and sexism.

Anybody who is sick and tired of Christianity being sidelined and mocked by the mainstream media and the Democrats.

Women who are worried about losing the opportunity to murder their babies in the womb wouldn't vote for Trump even if he hired a left of center woman as his VP choice. Blacks who are so consumed by the racial division sown by the Democrats could give a flying fuck whether or not Trump picks a black candidate because they are stuck on the plantation and anyone who tells them they can leave anytime they want they accuse of being an uncle Tom. Indians, Jews and Asians base their decisions on nepotism and orders to the diaspora from the homeland. It wouldn't matter who Trump picks because their vote is already made by foreign interests. So why the fuck should Trump burn his VP choice on some DEI pick when it's not going to make a damn bit of difference?

indians, on average, just scam and scam and scam their way to the top. it's only a matter of time before the effects are seen by even the most head-in-sand normie faggots.

Whatever the deep state/jews/illuminati/wall street/military industrial complex says they are. Its clear to anyone with above a 90 IQ that she is purely an empty vessel and does not think deeply or care to understand political issues and is purely in it for the rawness of ego gratification. Look at the way she responded to Tulsi Gabbard in 2020 when Tulsi slammed her on her record as prosecutor. this is a telling moment because it was a moment when she knew she was slammed and was in a bit of a panic - so people resort to their base self in these times "im ahead of you ijn the race" with a smug smirk. that's what she centralizes in herself - being an egotistical cunt - and nothing more. or when during the 2020 race she called biden a rapist and on one of those NPC shows after she had began campainging with him as VP the NPC asked her how she could be ok being a VP for a rapist and she cackled and said itts a debate! - she has no principles, no morals, she really is just the purest rawest essence of DEI. I am not even that racist there are lots of smart black (another thing - the notion that both her and michelle obama are "black" is laughable) people, lots of smart women. but kamala? she is not smart or capable. she is just PERFECT as a puppet due to her belief in nothing but her own ego gratification. all politicians have big egos of course, but with trump and even obama they do hold genuine political beliefs.

There is no way in hell they're letting a trifecta diversity hire NOT become "president". Mark my words, this will be the next "president" (as if that title even means anything). Trump is only involved at all to get white males engaged in the political process we checked out of years ago, but everyone knows he's just a kike servant at this point, even going so far as to fake an assassination attempt. Even if by some "miracle" trump wins, he's just going to sell the last chairs that aren't screwed down in the country to israel and cuba (the CIA).

Bij NB de politie hebben ze zelfs de integriteitseisen mbt sociale/familie kring verlaagd om maar dat diversiteitsstreven te kunnen verwezenlijken.

The sign is misleading. The way they will force whites to conscript is simply denying any employment to them, via all the DEI bullshit.
Their choice will be die for Israel or die of hungry. Most will prefer the first.

Yes, it is just "mechanics" on the bottom level. The times promote faggotry, and echonomical sentiments are funneled into this to where we have DEI and such policies. Then, after a few years, all gaming studios are filled with neo gashes and fags, and bumbling around POC women who donät know shit. Same with this spectacle, where everyone with a brain on them tend to duck down and wait for their paycheck.

It is all retards with immense "retard strenght" from their capital, affecting the world around them. All their assets should be siezed, and they should have their bellies slit open and be kicked into a ditch.

That would be SANE humanity, but America rules humanity now, and America LOVES heeb locust, and their quick gain schemes and their antagonism toward Evropa.

The only way the US can survive is if the military rises up and takes the power back from the deep state. Until that happens, expect nothing to get better.

The problem isn't the support for Israel, the problem is the unconditional obidience toward zionist. Zionism will be the destruction of both Israel and the US.

It's not just about him being a faggot, he is more or less a centrist with skills to debate even in such hostile environments as Fox News, he is arguably even less of a DEI hire than Kamala.

The left desperately wants Trump to drop Vance so they can finally address the elephant in the room that is annihilating their party; a general sense of poor planning and execution by the administration in office. The Democrats have no idea what they are doing, or what they need to do next and it is painfully obvious to the entire world. Their only hope to safe face against this massive failure for the party is to convince Trump to flip-flop on his VP pick, I point this out to point out how futile this post and sentiment really is. The notion of dropping Vance now is impossible, and only an idiot or a Democrat would genuinely promote it. The Republicans have the advantage in that their weirdo pick is still a better alternative than the DEI assassination insurance that the Democrats are foisting on their own party.

Something has shifted man. The normies are waking up. If these studio gangsta niggers are willing to come out and say positive things about Trump, it means niggers in the hood are chill with Trump now. They were not in 2020.

Even the faggy nerds in Silicon Valley are tired of woke and DEI. Andreessen Horowitz is one of the biggest venture capitalist firms, and it supports Trump.

She put her support behind a bill making shoplifting a felony over 950 dollars creating a shoplifting epidemic that still goes on today causing major businesses to shutter and relocate. She wants to give illegal immigrants free health care and wants to have a discussion about raising taxes up to 70 or 80%. She is the epitome of a worthless DEI hire. She had not gotten one single vote from ANYBODY she, the most unpopular candidate In the last primary, is now just going to be installed democratic process be damned. At least we are seeing the democratic party's true colors, just a nakedness lust for power so they can continue kicking conservatives, Republicans and constitution loving independents in the face, and raping the constitution for their stupid "vision" that is based on nothing more than computer modeling, bullshit, and hallucinations from huffing their own farts.

Oh that's right, the homeless destroyed your cities (like everyone told you) now people are surprisingly literally not moving in and threatening to crash local economies. Chickens came home to roost there didn't it.

You're correct in your assessment of the mechanics of bureaucracy but all the left will ever do is give lip service to the concept of addressing this as they are the primary beneficiaries of this system. Hollywood and DC are the most nepotistic capital owners around. Unless you think upper middle class republican homeowners and the My Pillow guy, even Orange Hitler himelf compare to what Disneyworld charges in rent, or Hollywood charges to rent out a studio in terms of capital ownership and rent. That is why they're so determined to hang rainbow flags from every rafter in the hopes you never figure this out.

They've been misdirecting most rank and file naive millennial and younger leftists like the koolaid drinking attack dogs they've programmed them to be since they charged them rent for far into their future for a college DEI/ESG receipt masquerading as a degree.

Elon musk may be wrenching power away from their system through dollars (such as buying twitter and kicking out all the makework commies) but the left's real capital investment is power over you through media and making politics extremely one sided.

US Navy already said what it is - a towed helium balloon with a sensor platform, towed by a Chinese or Russian sub. When the sub is discovered, it sends a remote command to deflate the balloon, shrinking it, which to the average DEI hire muttoid pilot looks like it’s “flying away at dickety Mach.”

Competency crisis isn’t just “lol zoomers R dumb”
It’s a combination of lack of training, lack of culturally adjusted people, lack of overall replacements, and lack of fucks to give.
White collared cooperate environments are either daycares that don’t allow no no words or soul crushing grind fests. As for the boomers, they learned from the layoffs of the silent generation in the 80s that they needed to gatekeep information and become critical to the functions of the organization.
They do not train others.
What this means is that as they retire they are taking institutional knowledge with them. Much of it created from scratch by their now dead silent and greatest generation mentors.
Their replacements are: Nihilistic Gen Xers who have been told all thier lives by the boomers that there will be nothing left for them after the boomers are gone, millennials who are angry and screwed out of work experience multiple times are are now 5+ years behind on average. And zoomers who were taught nothing in schools.
And this isn’t even addressing things like DEI which limited the number of talented and capable European and East Asian men in favor of Tiktok women or the Indian tendency to flood organizations with their clan members no matter the skill or ability level

1. Mass deportation of non-europeans out of the west. Mostly middle easterners and communist asians. They are not assimilating. I've been through out this entire country and they were the first to latch onto every extremist leftist motive and view point on this planet.
2. Fractional reserve banking needs to go. If not possible than the middle man needs to be cut out. That means lenders and fanny mae. We have the technology we should be automating the balance sheet and mortgages at this point no need for them to usury the amortization calcation and rates.
3. Private market constitution and a very limited litigation sector.
4. Church and state completely seperated. No divorce court. No tax relief. Only a religious unity.
5. Single family member houshold income economy.
6. Financial education starting at 7'th grade that is conservative and non-debt based but teaches entrepreneurship and the need for debt through bussiness needs not living above your means.
7. No more rap and degenerate music poisening the well of the youth. No more black culture main stream society (see #6). Only black sub-culture.
8. No more gay month. Gay day ok.
9. Only hard fall social programs. You have no other options and being drug tested is the criteria.
10. Get rid of Disney. There is no going back. Need a new one that tells stories of traditional ethnic Europeans with family values.
11. CRT, DEI out of public system completely.
12. Teacher's Union disbanded and removed of all funding.
13. Remove HOAs
14. Remove property tax
15. 10% flat tax
16. No more foreign wars.
17. Bring back firing lines for traitors and treason.
18. No more adderall.
19. Strong men that are molded from a young age not stunted.
20. A new Audit party that audits every system in our current nation and removes all the stupid and corruption existing.
21. Remove lobbying.
22. Term limits.

>Trump Upset That Misogynistic And Racist Attacks On VP Harris Are Backfiring
>As Republicans intensify their campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, they are struggling to settle on a unified line of attack, leaving former President Donald Trump both angry and frustrated.
>Recent days have seen a flurry of criticism directed at Harris from GOP figures, ranging from her handling of immigration and her past prosecutorial record to personal jabs at her demeanor. Some attacks have crossed into racist and sexist territory, with terms like “DEI hire” and criticisms of her childless status. On Wednesday, Trump labeled Harris a “radical, left lunatic,” only to call her “nasty” the next day in a Fox News interview—a striking echo of the insults he hurled at Hillary Clinton in 2016. However, these attacks on Harris seem to be backfiring, as they appear to be drawing more voters to her side.
>Michael Brodkorb, a former deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party, remarked, “Republicans are grasping at straws. They wanted to run against Joe Biden, and the emergence of Harris has thrown their strategies into disarray
>After Biden’s decision to withdraw and Harris’s entry into the race, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley indicated on Fox News that the shift would not affect broader Republican messaging. “President Trump will continue his campaign against the failed agenda of Joe Biden, whether it’s Kamala Harris or anyone else,” Whatley said.

Is Kamala Harris the quintessential DEI hire? It’s a legitimate question, given that Joe Biden made it clear during his 2020 election-year campaign that he would only consider a black woman for his VP slot. As president, he also claimed that the choice of Supreme Court Justice replacement for Stephen Breyer would be limited to a black woman. Not even the most qualified black woman, just someone possessing dark skin and lady parts.

Biden could have simply told the country that he was going to choose the most qualified person for either position. Instead, he said that his choice was going to be based primarily on skin color and gender.

What has this wrought? Let us tell you, it has positioned the capabilities of otherwise well-qualified people into the corner of racial and sex bias, regardless of intentions. Of course, maybe that was the intention all along.

You cannot convince anyone with even moderate powers of observation that this is not happening. Joe Biden and now Kamala Harris, along with their Democrat power operators, place intrinsic qualities such as skin color, gender, and sexual preference over meritocracy in assigning important roles in government cabinet positions, committee assignments, and security operations.

We have seen the result, and it isn’t pretty.

This is the fault of Obama politicizing NASA and turning it in to a DEI organization focusing on "climate change". It's the result of congress demanding the rocket run on Hydrogen because it puts out zero CO2 and not giving a fuck about what an absolute cluster fuck complicated system a hydrogen rocket is.
This is the same NASA that was willing to destroy the ISS as long as they could get the "first twat to do a space walk without a man" (pic rel)

Interesting that Kamala got destroyed in the primaries, but through DEI selection she became VP and then by Biden dropping out, she's now successfully sidestepped the primary process that flatly denied her and has become the nominee. Trump is absolutely right to constantly bring up how giving her the nomination is spitting in the face of the voters and shitting all over the democratic process. Hopefully he or Vance can work to articulate it better so they can hammer that fact home to the general public.

Importing niggers is akin to the ancient practice of alchemy, the idea of turning lead into gold. Alchemy never worked in the same way that DEI doesn't work, you can't turn useless eaters into productive members of society.
People forget that Judaism is a religion and religious people do retarded/terrible shit in the name of religion all the time.

The best way to prevent replacement is to accelerate the competency crisis until it collapses civilization because whites don't need civilization to survive.

Some of the white people pushing DEI are doing it for depopulation purposes because they know what will happen which is why agents such as myself are allowed to accelerate certain aspects of that plan on their behalf.

the outrage you see on the news are just Antifa paid goons, rebranded and being paid to wear different clothes and wave a different flag.
the outrage you see online is bots, the same people who are paying the Antifa goons, are also paying for the astroturf campaign
this is simply political disruption and chaos before this years election to distract from the absolute horror show called the Democratic Party and their failures.
The best analogy of the Democratic party would be that of the US Military. The people in power, did a bunch of DEI hires, fired actual real patriots who wanted to stand up for the country, now they are chocked full of mudslimes, browns, women who cant do anything, and men dressing as women for advancement. A few years of this nonsense and now the Military cant get any recruits, is having to lower standards on the ASVAB down to the 30th percentile and are in talks of lowering it down to the 10th percentile. In the past applicants would not be accepted in the past if they scored below 70th percentile. Now the standards are being lowered further and further in an attempt to accept practically anyone that signs up due to such low recruitment numbers.
Can you imagine, the military/army/navy go to EVERY high school and try to recruit and still cant get half of their projected numbers EVEN WITH lowering the ASVAB scores so that practically anyone above a 75iQ can pass.

https://www.officialasvab.com/researchers/history-of-military-testing/
https://www.officialasvab.com/researchers/scores/

This analogy talks about the US Military, but you can directly change out US Military with Democratic Party and get the exact same conclusion, outcome, and understanding. The Democratic party has filled itself with literal clowns, made a mockery of everything this country stands for, allowed the absolute wildest degeneracy to become commonplace, leading to the worst recruitment in the Dem party, nobody wants to vote for them, and everyone is voting red

It's true he's well in the lead. But his momentum has taken a huge hit, and his odds are down since July 13. He has made a number of blunders like being involved with that insane RNC DEI shitshow, his 93 minute speech that he foolishly waited until 11pm to give, and of course Sofa King. The question is, how many more blunders can/will he make, and will it put him within the "margin of fraud" as Jack Posobiec put it on Tucker.

I took the test on a lark, 'passed,' said fuck it, for grins & giggles bought a lifetime membership. Then I started attending events-and I noticed real quick and in a hurry that I was a little awkward socially, but not as bad as the majority of Mensans, so I stopped being such an autist and began acting more normally.
I'll say that Mensans can rage pretty well-they know how to drink and be promiscuous. Hook ups happen all the time. But they also have this weird rule (too many spergs?) about hugs-if you go to events you can get stickers at registration to say at what level you consent to be hugged by strange, creepy Mensans. And it's usually the dudes trying to hug some jugs b/c the sticker is the closest they can get.

We've been dealing with this since the 1960's. It not something new, and allowing them to have power makes redpilling white people much, much easier. I'm not really concerned so much with dismantling things like ESG, DEI, affirmative action, etc, because they're inherently incredibly inefficient and retarded copes for biological racial inequality. White people will still find a way to survive either way. The goal should be to disenfranchise/alienate them enough to wake them up.

/pol/ has a problem with Civilizational suicide and trying to create a literal Hell. Civilization is built on homogeneity (people having things in common), pursuit of excellence aka anti-equity, and exclusivity i.e. property rights. DEI is program of civilizational destruction and why nothing works, everything is expensive and cringe. DEI means no one has positive communities where people appreciate things of quality and beauty and exclude the substandard and ugly. DEI means all communities are gay tranny discords...nothing in common but mutilations forever like that Harlan Ellison story.
In other words, a DEI regime means everything must be made fake, gay, cringe, and retarded and thus DEI removes any that could possible inspire anything to give any purpose to living or aspiring anything other than a dystopian horror modern of degeneration. DEI is the AM ( program making a world were "We must all Scream but No Mouth" brought forth as a hyperstition. The only possible reason to support DEI is a desire to literally create Hell on Earth and make "God's Good Creation" into a Evil Piss World of joyless suffering.

More than just that, Whites are just the first to be targeted, the rest of the world shall soon follow suit under the same demoralization, everyone fighting one another over slights and desire for power. Everyone shoving each other off of the top of the hill to seize it for themselves. It leads to nothing more than a fragmented civilization where there will be no true peace of mind.

Those of other demographics who oppose DEI despite it being intended for them, fully know this and side with the ones being targeted now because they know down the line, this is their fate if this is not stopped. That they will be in the crosshairs tomorrow.

Obama is a dumb gorilla if he actually thought that would happen. I don't like Harris, but she is the fucking Vice President, expecting anything else but for her to take over at this point is just absurd. If they didn't like her they could have picked based on merit and not DEI, but that's not my problem. Harris is 100% justified to throw a chimpout if they try to take it from her, as much as I hate to say it it really is her turn in this regard.

Does make me wonder. Like, if the election were held tomorrow, she'd do better than she would have last week... she might even win. But only tomorrow. By this time two weeks from now, I expect she'll be doing worse than Biden was. What were these nigger-brained retards thinking? Should've waited til end of September or even middle of October for this horseshit. It's already peaked and we're months out. God help her if there's another Democrat scandal between now and November, she's already used up her one free get-out-of-the-news-cycle card.

he took over a major party offering what no other candidate was offering- this is no longer true. he HAS had an impact on the entire party and all of american politics for sure! BUT the big menace was what would trump do with 2 terms. that got broken really fast with the stolen election in 2020. he's now a single term president. doing 8 consecutive years in politics is very different than doing 4 years two times. don't lie to yourself.

the republican party already adapted to trump, the democrats already adapted to trump as well. the reason no one wants kamala's VP slot is for the same reason no one wants trumps VP slot. except that kamala has even less to offer. literally a DEI hire, being forced into a position. it's political suicide.

you KNOW that the dems would love nothing more than to replace kamala, but they can't. it's too late. nothing short of her and biden dying together would give dems an option to run a real candidate, this is a throw away election for them. they are going to focus on disruption, slandering, and sabotaging america right now. don't kid yourself.

I disagree. Err, rather, I think my take is a little more cynical than yours. I think that we lack modalities for thinking and acting beyond the scientific method and the state. Sadly, reactionaries and dissidents seem unable to imagine alternatives. It's understandable why they resort to policy-based solutions (e.g. eliminating DEI). But there comes a point when supposedly "practical" solutions which leverage instiutions those very dissidents purportedly stand opposed actually reflects low creativity or laziness.

This problem is known by another name: competence crisis.

People keep talking about the consequences of DEI. They're right to do so. But I see and hear few influential people talking about antecedents to competence -- namely, how people feel and experience modern life in America. That isn't completely surprising, obviously. Legislation and exception, the primary tools of the state, resolve crises and problems by identifying problems and addressing them with estimable solutions. Addressing people's inward, psychic conditions cannot be addressed by way of legislation and the results aren't easily measured, so there's little reason for anyone to talk about such things. The problem, though, is that living in a world where the state is expected to fix our problems means that pervasive issues of an other nature will fester; in this case, to the point of crisis. In plain English, there is no way of reversing this phenomena unless reactions to modernity (nihilism; I regard these as synonyms) become widespread.

Important info on Greg:
He most likely did covert ops before. Around the same time he “shot himself by accident” in 2019 undercover narcotics officers with the PA OAG engaged a suspect with gunfire, killed him, but were injured. Names of the officers not released to not blow cover. The attorney general back then was Josh Shapiro, the anti trump Dem governor of PA. Is there truly a connection between them? As governor he controls the state police. You need some local cooperation in glowops like this.
Earlier in the video, local cops count 5 shell casings. Then this glownigger shows up. After that they count 8. From audio analysis, shots 1, 2, and 3 were slow and steady. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are rushed. Then 9 is the final one which takes out crooks.
Working theory: FBI grooms patsy crooks. Some loner or loser, maybe he got in trouble for something, maybe they did the fake gf thing, parents are therapists. Either way, he was set up ahead of time, social media scrubbed before the shooting. If he had a libtard posting history a civil war could kick off. According to one senator or congressman at one recent hearing, he had heard that the family house was scrubbed clean like a lab. My thinking is that cooks was clearly set up. Let in somehow. Probably assigned the retard DEI D team but put people who knew about the plot in charge. Investigate people giving weird orders. Professional sniper somewhere else, perhaps as in pic rel. Maybe crooks was spotted too soon before getting into position that the pro had to hurry his shots. Cops arrested kids hours before they gave that fake statement to the media. ATF were the two grey suits. Gave out a number with a 215 area code. Look at the recent activities and location of any glowies nearby, especially Philly and Pittsburgh. May be significant that they tried in PA, where Biden’s circle has connections.

I'm all too familiar with street-shitters and their driving habits in Brapton.
I swear the 15 living in 3 bedroom house meme is obviously real because you can look at the 3 cars in the driveway and 4 more all parked in front of every house because they have their grandmother from India living in the garage. Brapton is the main cause of the terrible traffic in the GTA because every street-shitter drives a car to timmies then to their warehouse job at Amazon.

There must be a a dozen pajeet diversity hires in the banks and dealerships that are giving these uninsured dalits car loans and mortgages through DEI programs. Or because they pool their incomes the household net looks high and they get the preferential loans

While I had good memories at the start, not even 4 years later it turned into a DEI shitfest with everything banned, forced acknowledgement of country speeches for every powerpoint presentation, and immigrants killing the culture we once had. Plus, benefits are much worse now than 10 years ago.
Recruiting can't even meet half of 50% of their quota, which is why we now allow non-citizens to join.

You would think and certainly possible. But what if the DEI competency crisis has infected even these scumbags. Could be their “How to Assassinate the President” handbook is out of date since the 80s. Maybe there was some other fuckup. They really were eager to blow Trump’s head to mist in slow motion 4K on live TV to kill his legacy, humiliate his followers, and then Jan 6 style crackdown on everyone who engages in civil unrest. Maybe a coup like Erdogan where you use it to imprison all the regimes enemies. They might have been too eager for his blood and got launch fever. I actually think God might have intervened directly with how he turned his head at the last moment.

To be fair, many of the jeets are also low IQ retarded, but the Jews like them as golems and they are rapidly taking over by infiltrating major western companies through DEI recruitment.
Especially in a nation like Sweden, this is bound to happen, or has already been happening.
Even if the Somalis have no intention of doing so, the Jews and their leftists under their influence love the humiliation ritual of giving important positions to people they really believe are inferior.
I wonder why the Swedes don't feel threatened and believe that they will be left with some kind of white zone.

It's a terrible cope that the only reason people complain about immigration is because they're afraid of being cuckolded.
It is easy to imagine that people whose skin color is different from yours will be elevated to unjustly high social positions by the DEI, and will cronyistically recruit others of the same skin into their ranks, who will eventually seize power in society and start getting rid of you from important positions.
But you say, "I'm better off anyway because I get to have sex with women, unlike you incels", is that really okay?
Is it still okay because you can have sex while the city is being ravaged by more and more crime and public sector cronyism and corruption by the day?

Astroturfed, like you're seeing now with Kamala, except he's a more polished turd than Kamala is. And smartphones and social media were just coming on the scene, and Tik Tok wasn't around yet, which helped keep out some of the garbage we now get flooded with. The Smith-Mundt act wasn't amended either until about mid-Obama presidency, so that also kept out the propaganda for awhile under Obama. The economy imploded, but they hadn't quite started using the magic money printer to boost up DEI garbage. So as awful as it was, it was still better than what we'd have if Kamala's ass ends up behind the Resolute desk and better than what we have now. But it was the beginning stages of how many things are now.

>Kamala Harris's record as a prosecutor is marked by her unwavering dedication to justice and reform.
LOL. San Francisco is extremely unsafe and it has one of the highest amounts of human feces on the streets in the USA. Unsafe and disgusting. Doesn't even prosecute streetshitters.
>As District Attorney of San Francisco, she was a trailblazer in pioneering innovative programs that aimed to reduce recidivism and provide second chances, particularly for non-violent offenders.
That's an oxymoron and yes that's why it's unsafe, because she doesn't want to give criminals proper sentences.
>Harris’s approach included the establishment of the Back on Track program, which offered vocational training and education to help formerly incarcerated individuals reintegrate into society and break the cycle of crime.
There's still lots of crime in San Francisco so it didn't fucking work.
>In her role as California’s Attorney General, Harris took significant steps to address systemic issues within the criminal justice system. She championed policies to combat human trafficking,
But she doesn't care about illegal sales of fetal body parts
>secured substantial settlements against major corporations for consumer protection, and led efforts to reform practices that disproportionately impacted marginalized communities.
Niggers still commit the majority of crime there so her bullshit DEI reforms clearly didn't work.
>Harris’s tenure also saw her push for measures to increase transparency and accountability within law enforcement agencies. Kamala Harris has consistently demonstrated a commitment to fairness, equity, and the pursuit of a justice system that serves all people.
Nothing fair and just about not prosecuting Planned Parenthood officials when they brag about selling fetal body parts

Its both. they're both malicious and incompetent. When you didn't do your homework in school what did you say? Some version of i forgot my homework at home. Pretending to incompetence is the most common way people hide their malice. It's why immediately following the shooting the media went on a full blitz to blame it on the incompetence of the secret service. If they're just incompetent then they're not culpable for conspiring to assassinate trump. Thats the cover up, and honestly i'm amazed that cheatle went up to congress and was so defensive instead of playing up her presumed incompetence. You can tell thts what some of the congressmen were there to do, help her frame the narrative that she's a dei hire who don't know no better. And thats the real kicker, the fact that she couldn't play act with them to convince the public that the secret service is just understaffed and not very good at their jobs proves that she and the other conspirators are actually incompetent. They did try to kill trump, but they fucked it up and fucked up the cover up and she was forced to resign the day after the hearing because of her incompetent performance in covering it up.

Go watch TIKhistory on youtube. He has the best analysis on political systems.
However in my view you base politics on if the sysgem is contrilled by Jews or not. For example Russian communism was really Jewish Fscism. But Stalin purged most Jews and Russian communis became gentile communism. Western capitalism is Jewish Fascism. But if gentiles take it over then capitalism is labled white supremacist Fascism. If socialism is Cojtrolled by Jews for Jews then it js Jewish Fascism but if Hitler does it its Racist Fascism. The difference in systems is nobody ever calls oit thr Jewish fascism because Jews hide it behind their social Justice gaslighting. for example, Jews use DEI to force whites out of their jobs but never Jews. DEI is just cover for Jewish Supremacist Fascism. See pic

The games made by teams full with straight, Asian males are still good. The issue is that the DEI has ruined the industry in so many ways.

A great example for that is CDPR. The team, which made The Witcher 3 was 99% straight, white, male and Polish. And they made a great game. Right now their dev team is more diverse than some Californian studios somehow. Females with no skills, but weird pronounces and bright hair colors are now the average workers there. And Cyberpunk 2077 represents this quite well. I am afraid for The Witcher remake and The Witcher 4. We will probably see a "black bvll" instead of Geralt. Or Ciri might become lame, gay and black. Who knows what those freaks would even do this time.

I refuse to purchase a game, that is not made by either a full straight, white male team or full straight, Asian male team. Diversity can die in a ditch.

The good news are, that the Koreans are starting to emulate Japan in yet another thing - two of the latest Korean games were basically a side grade of their Japanese counterparts (Stellar Blade and Nier), (Lies of P and Sekiro/BB).

Meanwhile the West continues to produce slop, starring George "Yasuke" Floyd - the strongest samurai to ever live and the ruler of Wakanda.

Nothing will be fixed until the DEI funding stops and the games start to be made by skilled, passionate white and/or Asian men.

Eh,no. I wouldn't say that. They are so advanced that now they are gimped by chinese mentality and chinese culture, not by any technological gap. Westerners are gimped by jewish culture (christianity and its many marxist offsprings) and jewish mentality (such as DEI) and will inevitably lose any advantage.


Just look at their new solid state lithium batteries. These will not only be a commercial success as they age slowly and are difficult to set on fire, they will also boost chink diesel sub performance and chink electric torpedoes. The west have nothing comparable.

This makes sense, like the rest of the Anglo world our economy is hyper financialized and there's no genuine interest in industrial development
Boomers just sort of forgot the foundations of the economy and are living off the equity created from international richfags pumping their money into our housing market
The problem is finance is not innately productive, its meant to provide capital for productive enterprise, not supplant that productivity for financial speculation
But you can make a lot of make-work jobs for DEI purposes in finance that wouldn't be possible in a productive industry like resource extraction or manufacturing, so it fits like a glove
