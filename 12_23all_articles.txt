Why?
The "based and redpilled"
Movement didn't start with them
They don't own it
WE DO
Who is we? The people actually thinking
These people are unknowingly being infiltrated

See, conservatives actually think that the "good coming out" right now is because of their "based" traditional values. So they're all starting to infect these money/fame hungry people with the conservative mind virus (liberal mind virus = LGBT DEI feminism)..... Yes, that's right, there's one to control the right wingers too.

That's religion.
These faggot's are slowly becoming biblianigger kike proxy religion spreaders. Others are siding with sandniggers and islam and NEITHER of them truly attack kikes for betraying humanity so they can live lavishly and run the human/child trafficking networks, even Islam falls short and has it's own obvious, authoritarian downsides.

We haven't even gotten to the whole "earth is a human farm and the old Hebrews were the chosen.... as in chosen by aliens to help them farm us" topic.

Which is of course the main topic they want to avoid.
And thus the main topic I, and all true based and redpilled anons should talk about the most.

Conservatives have hilariously been using the whole "can't keep the truth from being known" thing.... Good, as was planned, now they will have to face their own truths they've been hiding or scared to address.

Both the Swiss-American an American-Cassinese congregations have no prohibitions in their constitutions baring entry a postulant or novice. Then you have groups like that Mater Dei and Labouré Society specifically tasked with dealing with student debt for religious. What order/monastery did you approach?

I've been doing this thing where I save up a bunch of money working for 6-8 months and then quit and live off of it for about year. I have no savings at the end of that year but I generally have no issue finding another job because I've acquired a new skill or cert in that period (I'm in IT)

one of the few advantages to the whole girlboss/DEI paradigm in tech is that they are incompetent and/or lazy as fuck so when they end up having to hire an asian guy like me I get the job instantly to pick up their slack. then once I get bored and have fixed some major issue I drop my work output to their level and eventually quit. management knows they can't fire the DEI hires so they get rid of me and then I can get unemployment for a little while.

not sure why anybody is whining about the current market, it's never been better IMO

For the why, a prompt answer is ESG, but there is more to consider:
1. Nearly all of game journalism is woke. If you dont apease, you will get bat press.
2. DEI destroyed companies from the inside, pushing talented folks out of there replacing them with hacks. The working climate besomes a horror show, see Disney, who got rid of all "tosic" talent. Check out the story around John Lasseter. Same for CD Project Red, same for Rcokstar Games, etc. We will see a drastic falloff in quality soon. Maybe not with GTA VI but later.

No, blackrock doesn't even care about the performance of the companies they own (for the most part). What they do is create ETFs, where you can buy into a basket of shares like the S&P500. The issue with them is twofold. First, these holdings are enormous and they take a maintenance cut of up to a couple percent. Secondly, they are the biggest shareholder of most large companies while having zero of their own money at stake. This creates massive opportunities for abuse of power like this DEI shit. ETF shares should simply be excluded from voting rights imo.

DEI is forced down people’s throats, companies and Hollywood constantly lose money because the propaganda doesn’t sell well but they still do it anyway. This is not the fault of capitalism but that’s not even the point actually. I’m not a great fan of capitalism, there’s a false dichotomy here but socialism doesn’t even pretend to work with human nature, socialism is an explicitly anti-Aryan jewish idea. The idiots who promote socialism to conservatives are often sponsored by the Soros network actually as a d&c operation. The reality is that socialists always go after the middle class, not the rich (eg kulaks) because in aggregate that’s the wealthiest demographic, yes even richer than the 0,001%. Socialists milk people like me and my friends with ridiculous taxes and regulations, redistribute my money to their political clients (ie women, wiggers and, soon, niggers) while stealing a good chunk for themselves and their financier friends. That’s socialism. That’s what socialism always becomes. That’s its purpose. If my only other realistic option is liberal capitalism, I’ll take that.

went to a top 5 boarding school in New England, can confirm

To be perfectly honest, I'm a fuckup right now (hence why on here instead of socializing on the last friday night of the year) but I know I can step back into the "high life" at a relative snap of my fingers. I was expelled from that school and even as an incomplete alum, just belonging to the culture (and embodying it in my persona) has kept me in the network, where if people simply like you, that's it, you're set with access to various choices of lifestyle, career, etc.

I've come to feel a bit jewishly decadent about this but I've had, taken, and declined opportunities that public school (or normie-tier irrelevant private school) kids have to claw their way to. Frankly I think it's a matter of effortlessness; when people see how effortlessly you loaf through life - especially when with some kind of artistic, individualistic flair - while remaining competent/well spoken, they trust you exponentially more. It's like it relaxes this alarm system everyone has on people with desperation or people whose lives are heavily impacted by your decision to hire/invest in/network with them.

Furthermore, the premium of upperclass social fluency increases in value to the elite as society integrates more and more outsiders (poors, niggers, browns, mentally ill/troons etc) who are greater liabilities than assets and who are increasingly resentful (aware) of their insurmountable subordination to the real power that only pretends to care for the DEI faggotry.

Anyway I'm rambling bc I'm high but my point is you're right and the prepschoolpill is one that I'm surprised to see is taking so long to reach mainstream consciousness despite all the victimhood olympics of the past decade.

It literally makes me laugh out loud to think the various shades of shitskins around the world believe they are going to hit the lottery when whites are extinct...you better think this through again.
DEI has already been exposed in the workplace as nothing but a façade. They put Old nana or Jamal in a maintenance position and when it is time to fix/repair something, guess who they have to call to actually get the job done? The white man. Can you filthy fucks imagine the condition of the earth in just a short time without the white man's expertise in sanitation and cleanliness? Holy fuck.
Infrastruture is going to go to shit. Innovation will be non-existent. The asians that will probably be in control will not be able to have a maintained, orderly society. When we are gone, there will only be the few masters among the cradle to grave servants. No one to protect them fight for them...and no one to save them. Your future bloodline will NOT be looking forward to the worldwide communism coming. You think you live in a toilet now, most will not be able to fathom what is coming for them.

Not entirely true. For business critical roles, we don't even factor in diversity hiring. We hire the best people we can or there's serious consequences to our business. OP is only seeing non-white applicants because he is getting the trash tier candidates.

Because the Canadian government gives out subsidies, grants, tax breaks, and other goodies to companies who meet certain DEI/Diversity goals like hiring exclusively nonwhites. (beyond what was being offered under DEI programs from private financers.)

Companies are paying these people a fraction of the minimum legal/industry wage because the rest of their employment costs are being covered by tax dollars.

In comparison there isn't a single subsidy or grant being offered to hire whites, so you have to foot the whole bill to employ them, which means off the hop you can't afford to compete with diverse companies without charging absurd rates nobody can afford now.

It has nothing to do with whites being losers, and everything to do with an openly hostile, rootless, greedy, psychopathic, jewish/boomer, financier, upper class, and ruling class destroying our nation and people for pennies on the dollar.

It doesn't matter how much they attempt to destroy a meritocracy, if you have skills and can problem solve, you will never be denied the job. Everyone and I mean everyone loves a person who will make them successful. That's why minorities are finally getting a piece of the successful pie! With the new DEI initiative, success is literally just a diversity hire away. And the minority gets shuffled around to all the company photos, and promo materials.

It's standard practice when you start directly naming Zionist Jews that are occupying Ukraine's government that they just go "but Putin/Assad/whoever is a Jew/Jewish puppet". They don't actually care if what they post is accurate or not, the goal is just to change topic away from the subject.

Companies like (((Google))) and (((Meta))) made cuts to DEI programs in 2023, they've also laid off a lot of their most useless diversity hires. And this trend will only continue in 2024.

Look retard the old "right wing corporate billionaires" thing is old news. Like mid 2000s shit lol what do you still watch Bill Mahr too? For the last ten years corporations have been no holds barred homo tier DEI, and since covid the left literally sucks Pfizer cock lol. Like literally if Pfizer had a cock they would actually suck it. Get with the times bro.

It's crazy because Pfizer etc. is probably the one corporation that even left and right sort of thought poorly of.. like one of the few things people could agree on, and now we literally have leftists out there with Pfizer tattoos kek. Tables have turned I guess.

That would require an Argentinian Central Bank (central banks are one of the main ways for globohomo to control the world, that's why they created the federal reserve), but Milei is going to implement free banking so that's not gonna happen

They're not faking it, and even if they were, curtailing the government's power certainly doesn't help them achieve that goal. DEI is downstream from government regulations, like Disparate Impact in the US

Jared Taylor asks if Jews will learn anything Anonymous ID:2zV2vd/j Thu 28 Dec 2023 22:00:45 No.453360186  Replies: 29 ViewReport
Jews—who have pushed diversity and antiwhiteness for decades—seem to think they get a special exemption as holocaust survivors and perpetual victims.

Thanks to current events and to jewish wealth and prominence, jews are not just hwhite oppressors: they are *uber* oppressors.

The question therefore is: Will Jews learn anything? Will they insist the solution is “Holocaust Awareness Training,” starting in Kindergarten? Will they demand that DEI offices add them to the victims list, so they can be coddled and made to “feel safe,” along with blacks and trannies?

This Jewish law professor makes the stupidest possible argument in the bluntest possible way. “To fight antisemitism on campus, we must restrict speech,” writes Claire O Finkelstein.

“Please,” she says, “hate hwhite gentiles all you like—but leave our precious Jews and other minorities alone.”

Jews are smart, but they can be appallingly blind. They have been busy promoting mass immigration, diversity, multi-this and multi-that. Bill Ackman has realized that Jews cannot escape being “white.” They need to decide which side they are one, before they get chewed up by the multikulti madness they helped set in motion.

>Only someone who has shed any semblance of inner sanctity, of an innate, lofty, human status, can center his godly worship on this public expression of his animal-like tendencies. This naturally leads us right up to Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz’s well-known piece on Ba’al Peor (Sichos Mussar, Parshas Va’eschanan), in which he expounds on the idea of this idol’s capacity to allow for total hephkei’rus, the utter shedding of all moral inhibitions. One forfeits his exalted human status through such deplorable and depraved displays of allowing his animal-like side to completely take over

>When the generation of those who stood at Sinai lived up to their description as the “dor dei’a,” however, they simply had no need to excrete bodily waste. They ate the heavenly manna- “lechem she’mal’achei ha’shareis ochlin bo”- which was miraculously absorbed within their system. When they acted like angels, they resembled these celestial beings even to the point that they consumed the identical food; and thus, like the angels, there was no need at all for animal-like hotza’as re’e

>Naming the Idol

>1. Focusing now on the idol that stripped them of their dignity, we encounter the following difficulty: If we were now to select a name, a short title, perhaps, that, in lashon hakodesh, would successfully capture the essence of this deity, would we not then opt for one that focuses on this despicable public display of defecation? Indeed we might do so but we happen to find otherwise. And the name ultimately given surely warrants further scrutiny

You still don't understand then or you are influenced by or are part of the enemy faction.
There is no real "conservative" party as those parties are usually based on religions which are themselves just created to control the populace many thousands of years ago.

The modern version of this is the DEI, LGBT, feminist collectivists and this is the mental affliction, the mind virus of the left. But, the right is also retarded for not seeing what is right before their eyes.

Leave out the left wing.
Just anarchists.
If you want to add in something the case could be made for anarcho capitalism but this also falls short as we've never had a real true natural human hierarchy civilization or nation.

We're being farmed by aliens basically. Until we address this, nothing else matters.

You're a fucking idiot, OP.

As such, if you want to get a job in America in this day and age—you have to act like a jew to defeat the jew.

When you're in an interview and they ask you a question, find a way to lie and say that you're half-black or half-spic and how you had to deal with the racist gringos all your life or something.

Now, if you're pale white....say it was your dark-as-shit-African-Zulu-tribe grandfather who taught you x, y, and z lesson.

DEI is Blackrock's strict rulebook that all new US companies must follow if they want to be listed on the stock exchange. Muh diversity. Muh equity not equality.
Muh inclusion. Basically BLM, LGBT, and MeToo applied to the office and weaponized to filter out white straight male employees. Blackrock holds trillions of dollars in US real estate and pensions. Basically if you try to dismantle BlackRock you will kill the US economy but if we don't dismantle it and throw Larry Fink in the brink forever, we kill ourselves.
Of course BlackRock is well aware of the backlash. They are fine with stupid plants like OP's Bari Weiss posting rants because she is there to keep the Overton window from moving over a cliff.
BlackRock will likely change its name and/or superficially divvy itself into smaller fronts that obfuscate criticism, render online archives less informative, and confuse normies. Or maybe they won't.

We only have until 2030 and then it's curtains for the WEF bugs pods nwo.

See, conservatives actually think that the "good coming out" right now I'd because of their "based" traditional values. So they're all starting to infect these money/fame hungry people with the conservative mind virus (liberal mind virus = LGBT DEI feminism)..... Yes, that's right, there's one to control the right wingers too.

That's religion.
These faggot's are slowly becoming biblianigger kike proxy religion spreaders. Others are siding with sandniggers and islam and NEITHER of them truly attack likes for betraying humanity so they can liv lavishly and run the human/child trafficking networks.

We haven't even gotten to the whole "earth is a human farm and the old Hebrews were the chosen.... as in chosen by aliens to help them farm us" topic.

Which is of course the main topic they want to avoid.
And thus the main topic I, and all true based and redpilled anons should talk about the most.

Conservatives have hilariously been using the whole "can't keep the truth from being known" thing.... Good, as was planned, now they will have to face their own truths they've been hiding or scared to address.

American corruption isn't just legal, it's tax deductible.
The corruption of the police and the police force is a part of the laws themselves. They get to keep what they "confiscate" (civil asset forfeiture), they make money off of writing tickets, they have labor unions that make sure they are paid 10x more than people with similar education and training.

SOME police departments were/are known for horrific corruption. The New Orleans Police Department one of the worst. New officers were paid $17,500 / year, that's less than what the trash collectors made there.
They busted hundreds of them, and upped the salary to like like $50k (still shit), and now they are just a "little" corrupt, (but still 100% incompetent).

>>453250773
>They do son; and as more shitskins and DEI types are put on the force, the corruption will accelerate.

The "probable cause" is that you have a lot of cash. With Civil Asset Forfeiture you have to prove you are NOT a criminal to get your money/property back. They DON'T have to prove that you were ever doing anything illegal.

McAusland, who also admitted selling drugs while on duty in his Paterson police vehicle, was sentenced to 66 months in federal prison. His prison term is scheduled to end in January 2024. McAusland had worked as a rehabilitation aide at the hospital from 2010 to 2014 before he became a city police officer.

Then, who admitted pushing Casciano to the ground at the hospital, was sentenced to six months. Federal records show Then has completed his prison sentence and is currently in a reentry program.

Authorities said they found Then’s recording of the assault of Casciano when they arrested McAusland on the drug charges, seized his cellphone and reviewed its contents.

McAusland and Then were among seven rogue Paterson cops arrested by the FBI during the past two years. The others — Jonathan Bustios, Daniel Pent, Eudy Ramos, Frank Toledo, and Matthew Torres — admitted shaking down motorists and their passengers during illegal traffic stops and illegally taking money from people. Those five area awaiting sentencing.

Love, love, love! A subtle, beautiful illustration of the New Black Order rising.

A beautiful young woman, standing euphoric with the powerful, dynamic Black man who is going to fuck her brains out.

Then the sexless white boys. Dejected, background boys, sexless, immature. They huddle alone like those beta orangutans who never evolve the hyper-masculine features of the alpha. These boys will never get a whiff of a pussy worth fucking, and they will likely toil their lives away for some haughty girlboss who's 100% dedicated to DEI and hating white supremacy, one little "right sizing" away from career death.

They will develop unhealthy addictions in their inceldom. If they don't drink or bake their brains on weed, they will fall down an abyss of porn addiction—perhaps they will join us in this very thread—wasting away in their gooncaves. A few will ultimately become trans women.

This shit is art.
The glaring, inevitable death of young whiteness. The obliteration of the West.
The glorious dominion of BBC.
The conversion of white women to breed Black.

We are only at the start of the new Black kingdom, my brothers. Please try to pace yourselves as you jerkoff to your slow-motion extinction. When Black power ends my life in 30-50 years, I want my brain to be a dopmaine-deprived walnut, crusty and damaged, destroyed by a lifetime of gooning to Black dick. The last rubbery orgasm of my worthless white life will be when young Black hands wrap around my old white turkey throat and choke me until I shit my pants.

I fucking pray to a nonexistent, dead white God that my last squirt of DMT dreams before oblivion will be Black men and their magnificent cocks. Then it's down, down into that eternal Black night we all return to.

Remember that even the end and eternal nonexistence after this fever dream of interracial fuckery called life is BLACK. That should tell you everything about who is meant to own this universe.

This 2 year old Campus Reform video is pretty interesting. It's the standard format, conservative channel sends somebody to make woke college kids look dumb. She asks them about diversity quotas and they all vehemently agree they are a great idea. She then asks whether diversity quotas should be applied to sportsball teams, and they all say "no, that's different", that should be entirely on merit. Then shows a montage of the college football team (all but 1 player is black), and they all paused for thought and then did a 360 and admitted that they were wrong about diversity quotas.
What struck me was how easily their minds were changed when confronted with the inconsistency of their opinions. They've clearly just been spoonfed a diet of DEI without ever having been
given the opportunity to apply critical thinking.
It suggests that deprogramming is not difficult.

Yeah this is very true. Professionals and management in Canada are actually disproportionately white especially at the higher levels.

Canadians actually appear to be more ethnocentric than Americans, but in a weird leftist way. Not being as hyper-capitalist, hyper-individualist, hyper-merit based actually isn't a bad thing in conditions of mass migration.

I have actually seen some very racist actions from white liberal managers. Of course they always lie and say that they love diversity. I have also seen all-white executive teams go hard on diversity for the lower ranks, sacrificing young Canadians for their own safety.

But once DEI takes over an organization then the rot sets in. A white male will never be hired there again. This has happened at the big banks and with some public sector fields (like the TTC). Small and medium sized companies are thriving through as they are sucking in all the white talent that's been locked out from larger DEI corps.

People do not realize how in-group selective Canadians really are.

In Canada, it has never been about what you do, but who you know. Especially in the west, that’s all I can speak for.

In these modern times, it will be impossible to do a draft (especially if aimed at White Men). Pozzed DEI is anti-merit pro-incompetence. It's Joever. You really think those street snatching recruiting style in Ukraine will work in the USA? Hell no. Even most normies on bog Lefty cities know our gov is ZOGGED, you think country boys are gonna get drafted?

Don't fret on it too much. With interest rates increasing the ability for DEI departments to defend hires that have produced no value is becoming more and more difficult.
The dirty secret is that each employee has a profit value associated with them (ROI).
These people are overwhelmingly negative value.

I did notice that, and I think it's because >>453010856 what anon said.
There are simply bigger fish to fry for the DEI/LGBT/ADL/BLM Woke Alphabet Mafia right now, and Christmas was at the bottom of the list.

Sadly, in a nearby city and several towns there weren't anywhere near as many Christmas decorations on the main drags as usual. The reason why was clearly stated back on Black Friday; they'd spent too much money on sheltering and feeding illegal immigrants, and didn't have enough left over for a few hundred wreaths, Christmas lights, and other things to decorate their nicest public areas—which they've all done since before I can remember. My town was luckily spared and we had the usual festivities.

Yesterday I was blown away by how many combinations of politically correct Christmas greeting cards the store had; for example, Hallmark has specifically labeled sections for; "To Dad and Dad", "To Mom and Mom", "To Parents (Non-Binary)", and several others.
That part wasn't so surprising, but it was sad. What was funny was most that while normal ones were almost all sold out, it seemed like they hadn't sold a single one of the gay ones.

Overall I was glad to see that there was way less "Happy Holidays" type stuff though, and every place I shopped at over the past week I got a proper "Merry Christmas" from both staff and people I saw.

As long as DEI hires are running the show, I have very little trust in society.
People tend to misunderstand what this means. I'm okay with a nigga being in charge of some complex system, but not a unqualified nigga. The bar shall not be set to different heights for different people. Women are a topic for another
time. Every American should be treated equally under the law. Fuck all the rest of y'all. 5eyes, y'all alright but you ain't him.
If Elon Musk, John Doe, and Dequan Jackson all steal a TV from Wonkaland, the law should be blind to the individual and treat every citizen equally. Until the judicial system returns to this state, it will have zero accountability and quite frankly, it deserves none.

whiny faggot. he should have purged the deep state from day one instead of hiring useless officials repeatedly. then he treated the media with kid gloves begging for their approval or complaining about them childishly, instead of just kicking them out of briefing rooms. did nothing to stop anti white businesses, dei,etc., did nothing to stop big tech. his only big win was scotus, which has probably lost the republcians lots of elections thanks to the abortion ruling (still a win, albeit not tactically). overall -- great guy, great bants, pretty ineffective, albeit infinitely better than dems.
oh and then he let niggers run wild for months and didn't do anything to end the riots, before pardoning other niggers.

hopefully he picks tuicker and with project 25 cleans house this time around. if he picks a weak vp choice we know its gonna be round 1 again.

99% of "Christian" churches in the U.S. now are corporations, subject to various government regulations on their speech, if they want to keep all of their tithe money. If these churches start having regular sermons which go against the DEI policies of the federal government, then they will lose their not-for-profit-corporation status, and be forced by the courts to give a large portion of the incoming tithes to the federal government. Obviously, this situation is an egregious violation of the 1st Amendment, but this is what we have in America.

>why are women such snotches and rule enforcers?
They always have been. Study history, its not hard to realize thats a feminine archetype, one men are usually scorned for emulating because it makes them effeminate. Its such a common trope you could close your eyes, flip to a page in a book of myths, and randomly land on an example.
>gen x
What makes you think this is a generational thing and not a female thing?
>They are obsessed with making everyone less productive and like the harder way of doing everything.
Again, this is how women assert their relevance in a hierarchy when they serve no productive purpose. Its why women made the best enforcers, informants, and snitches under communism. Its why DEI human resources hags are uniformly beta female tattletales, snitches, and gossips. Women who think they arent desireable become power mad lunatics, its the villain female of every fairytale. Its the jealous step sister, etc. Nietzsche spends several chapters discussing this archetype in Beyond Good and Evil.

I've just started, but please do yourself a favor and just try and watch something on the fag screen and get some notes on the assholes that want us to pretend that race-mixing is the new normal cuz they fucking said so and shoved it down our throats (or tried to unless you had an EKG reading). That sure as hell ain't the only thing.

There's this shitty commercial by "Aldi" that pretends to have circumvented Bidenjewflation, and it shows people getting all pissed off because of prices then finding themselves in grocery store heaven after raising mostly peaceful protests in the store. They are of course DEI compliant casting, and you just know not one damn one of of these shitty actors would ever get pissed about being told to wear a mask or take a shot, and probably were only outraged if you refused.

Uptake is they are acting like they give one fuck a out anyone but their social engineering racket, their delusions, their strange and fragile hold on power which is soon to implode (they left the fucking border open! 20M fucking unknowns in real life Risk), and of course they want us to think racemixing is normal and nevermind that covid shit, plus you should probably take ur shot lol (that or something like that is on the way).

Remember, it's another Presidential Election Year, and Kissinger just went to hell, so that's two reasons they are going to make it a special year. Look out. It's going to get REAL stupid.

Those buildings that tie up real estate for cities like SF or NYC that have astronomical housing costs yet the Jews keep praising the gdp growth of an economy with more homeless people on the streets in those cities they keep making up every excuse to convert empty office buildings designed around a society that used paperwork and books and made so many jobs that have been replaced with automation?

The fake and gay “Chinese” virus that somehow became a perpetual vacation for Democrats in SF, Denver or NYC for boomers to remote work at home? To bamboozle college kids into woke garbage that means nothing instead of office internships to offices that sit empty?

Who are the faggot niggers trying to hold onto power? Grooming their family into bureaucrat jobs that don’t mean anything in the 21st century after they themselves outsourced it to work smarter not harder with Pajeets in India, then completely replaced and made redundant by automation, while chimping out about Pajeets coming into the west thanks to their own reckless immigration policies.

Neither. Accept both sides of who you are, now use your non-European background to your advantage for admission, scholarships, DEI, welfare etc. while refraining from doing anything anti-white. The real question you have in front of you is which side do you choose for your lineage? Right now you’re a halfling but your kids will be majority one or the other, honestly though considering jews are the group with most power I would mate with a jew to move my offspring closer to that race. If you bed a jewish woman your children are automatically considered jews so that solves that problem, this would also get you Israeli citizenship which could be useful if they manage to pull of the Greater Israel project. As an aside, stop thinking in terms of ideals and start thinking practically about everything. Read The Decline of the West by Spengler. We’re living in the Iron Age, specifically the Jewish Century, once you accept that you can start thinking strategically as to what to do with your life. In the age of non-European victimhood, use your mixed blood to your advantage. Good luck.

Yeah I don't like the snip snip. I am Catholic but my parents were hippies. Otherwise the acoustic guitar destroyed Christianity and made it weak. Objectively Europe kicked arse for about 1,500 years following Christianity with relative fervour and scholarship. It is more humane than Judaism and more philosophical than Islam. It incorporates Pagan and Platonic philosophy with the humanity of monotheism. It is openly mysterious and based in balance if followed by both faith and works, sorry denominationfags. By considering all schools of thought, from reactionary Opus Dei to Lutheran Kierkegaard. It does require an aristocratic soul to nurture an esoteric forbearance toward Christianity. One even an atheist must accept Christ as per Buddha, Mohamet, Maimonides, Lao Tzu as Ascended Mssters with some possibility of divine spark in them.

Oh and if I have to use oil to cook with it’s only butter. I drink a few times a week but keep it to three now that I’m getting older it’s a bit tougher to bounce back. I’m looking to sell out of the economy completely and buy a small farm outright so I can grow all my own food and pay an easy $200 in annual property taxes. I frankly don’t trust any of the food sold at the grocery store so doing farmville would in fact improve my diet tenfold.

I’ve been a pretty decently successful television media producer and get random consulting jobs all the time. I hope I never have to sit in a DEI meeting ever again.

Killers of the flower moon is unfathomably based. Might be the most based movie of all time. Same underlying concept, at a first glance it seems like some DEI shit that just hates on white people. That's not what it's about at all, the entire movie is one giant antisemitic dog whistle, and it is masterfully crafted. The general public had no fucking idea, and the DEI PoC Jewish golems gave it phenomenal ratings. Scorsese will go down as the goat for this movie.

My friend's dad was a successful head hunter for many engineering firms for decades. He was forced into retirement due to no more jobs popping up and dealing with millennial and zoomer HR reps not being bothered to communicate with him so he can build new connections with firms.
I have a stem degree and am stuck working service tier bullshit. While my brother has an art degree from a now defunct for-profit school, working from home as an "app dev" who works less than 20 hours a week, and easily 10 of those are meetings. He makes ~$150k/yr. His pig of a wife got fired from her last job as a "director" of a preschool, has a child psychology degree from a for-profit online school. Now is working from home as an HR rep making ~50% more than she did at the preschool.
It's all bullshit, it's all fake and fucking gay. It's a popularity contest now more than ever before thanks to social media. And DEI/ESG is affirmative action run a-fucking-mok.

Tale as old as time. There used to be a commonly-used term called “nigger rich.” It was a slur against whites who were bad with money and would blow their entire paycheck within a few days or so on dumb shit. Black people have been historically terrible with money. Now that many have been socially-engineered into higher income brackets via DEI cancer I’ve noticed companies that sell high-end perfumes, handbags, all that overpriced garbage, prominently feature black people in their advertising. So these people given jobs they did not earn based on merit piss away their comfortable income they should be buying homes with and other ways to build equity. But, no. So we just have more money being tossed down a black hole and a continued shrinkage of the middle class.

We should also embrace Jewish allies at home such as Bill Ackman now that they are turning against DEI. Having Jews like Bill on our side is a win for our team.

Twitter never turned a profit, they just made it worth exponentially less since Elon took over and quit playing uniparty agitprop ball.
The issue with a lot of these tech companies based in blue states, Cali most importantly, are so deeply embedded in ESG/DEI nonsense that they can't purge the useless hires like they used to. One good example is companies based out of California that reach a certain employee size, must have a 50/50 split of male to female executives on their governing boards. Regardless of merit. Especially in the current year when we don't know what a man or a woman is anymore.
That says enough for me. Gone are the days of great cullings of useless positions during economic downturns, this is made doubly worse when a vast number of other non-ESG/DEI positions are outsourced.

>Bill Ackman is a graduate and billionaire donor. He has tumbled to the fact that “Whiteness at Harvard is deemed fundamentally oppressive” and that “Jews are presented as white people. It is therefore ok to hate Israel and Jews as they are deemed to be oppressors.” Mr. Ackman says he only just figured this out. Better late than never, but he is Jewish, and complains mostly to President Gay about “the antisemitism that has exploded on campus during your presidency,” adding stupidly, “Antisemitism is the canary in the coal mine for other discriminatory practices at Harvard.” No. White-hating is the canary in the coal mine, and it flopped dead in its cage decades ago – even though Billionaire Bill never noticed.

>The GOP never noticed, either. On December 5, House Republicans held a press conference with Jewish students to talk about antisemitism on campus. Fine. When did Republicans ever invite white students to talk about anti-whiteness on campus?

...

>Jews, who have pushed diversity and anti-whiteness for decades, seem to think they get a special exemption as Holocaust survivors and perpetual victims. Thanks to current events and to Jewish wealth and prominence, Jews are not just white oppressors, they are uber oppressors.

...

>The question, therefore, is: Will Jews learn anything? Will they insist that the solution is Holocaust awareness training, starting in kindergarten? Will they demand that DEI offices add them to the victim’s list so they can be coddled and made to “feel safe,” along with blacks and trannies?

is this true? Harvards black gay president, still hates white people and is definitely a DEI hire, who the initially hoped to use to destroy whites. obviously its the zionist lobby now pushing back against her. Im not saying she should be replaced by a jew but wouldnt it be better to support removing any diversity hires and getting rid of DEI in our institutions, even if its the jews currently spearheading this movement?

im genuinely curious and have mixed feelings, the zionist power structure is obviously the biggest problem for our country and the world, but if they are already in power wouldnt it be more useful to support getting rid of DEI and continuing to red pill whites along the way, and shifting the overton window in our favor?

or is AutumGroyper correct that its better to temporarily support a gay black leader because she is pushing against zionism for the time being?

i could easily do this i am massively over qualified but don't want to go higher into sales oriented anything and the corpo i work at is so mismanaged and DEI dysfunctional they would never notice. I could even have the shifts overlap, work a 12 hour day playing vidya half of it and still hold down both of them. You don't realize how dysfunctional corporate america really is. Tyrone can't write emails, can't communicate over the phone, can't IM people and communicate, it takes him fucking 2 hours to do something that takes me 10 minutes and 30 seconds writing an email.

This can't go on much longer though it's just so dysfunctional that everything is being replaced by pajeets simply from them being a 6 out of 10 and that's enough to beat a dysfunctional niggerized feminized 4 out of 10 corpo america

The competency crisis is already at doomsday level at all governmental institutions in most countries. DEI policies ensure that no real talent is going in. Feds rely on private IT contractors to carry out operations against immediate terror threats but everything else just slips and soon these IT contractors too will fall to the competency crisis due to the universal DEI push. It will happen sometime in this decade, but it's certain the surveillance state is losing ground fast. This is what happens when you alienate key demographics.

Funny you ask that, I just bought the entire Apple Ecosystem (iPhone, iPad, iMac, Apple Watch) for the first time. I really enjoy the design features of these, but ffs does MacOS have it fair share of bugs and inconsistencies I'd never dream would be present on an Apple Product after all that propaganda about how MacOS is better than Windows during the "Hello I'm a Mac" ad campaign. Pretty disappointed. Also, why the fuck some iPhone apps are incompatible with iPadOS and MacOS, but they all share the same UI? Fucking confusing and unbelievable.

Some inconsistencies I found so far:
-iPhone sometimes sync properly, other times stay in step 2 of 4 sync limbo
-Deleted user account still appear on login screen on MacOS, until you restart
-Cannot connect via bluetooth my iPhone to my Mac as a hotspot, have to manually connect them with USB cable, fucking retarded
-Multitouch feature on Magic Mouse way to sensible, cannot count the number of times I,ve switched windows or apps because my finger wasn't still enough
-The "hand" icon in Safari when hovering above hyperlinks most of the time do not appear and remain the default mouse pointer arrow, confusing you about if some text/picture is a link or not
-iMac way too light, meaning it isn't steady when cleaning the screen. Have to use second hand to restrain it.

I suspect years of DEI hiring policies pretty much made Apple shit shitty OSes. After all, pajeets cannot code, niggers don't do shit and faggots and hipster are more concerned about useless UI bells and whistles than making a functioning one.

Let alone that europe has no weapons or military gear, etc
Trump pissed em off, and they laughed at him, when he told them that they had to start paying their agreed upon amount for defenses, based upon their GDP's
They just always assumed that they could fall back on the USA to save them.
They started putting a bit more, but then broke their promises and never hit even a fraction of the required amounts
Then ukraine happened, and they had to give up the stocks that they had.
Now europe is depleted, and it takes years to replenish military stocks
(I have a friend at lockheed, that explained the timelines to me)

Europe isn't really going to have much to help pissrael, especially since they need to build up stocks to protect themselves as WW3 progresses into real battles. Ones that threaten europeans, and not just the country that's been trying to undermine them for over a centurty.

Adventists Samuele Bacchiocchi responded to those claims, by pointing out that "interpreting 666 on the basis of the numerical values of the letters of names can give absurd results". He also notes the Donation of Constantine was considered as true to the point "this forged document was used by 10 popes over a period of six centuries to assert, not only their ecclesiastical supremacy over all the churches, but also their political sovereignty over what became known the Papal States, which included most of Italy." He also states the title "Vicarius Filii Dei" was considered as an official title of the pope.[25]

Vicarius Filii Dei (Latin: Vicar or Representative of the Son of God) is a phrase first used in the forged medieval Donation of Constantine to refer to Saint Peter, who is regarded as the first Pope by the Catholic Church.[1]

I think it's important to remember Buckhaults discussion of the DNA limits (I'm paraphrasing from memory). Basically, traditional vaccines had an "allowable DNA material" limit because they used antigens like dead viruses, so there'd have to be some DNA in there. But when dealing with these new RNA "vaccines" the limit for allowable DNA material should be zero. So the fact these RNA vaxxes are blowing the DNA limits out of the water is terrifying ... for vaxxies. Personally, not my problem, so I will sleep well tonight.

I hear what you guys are saying. I still think that incompetence and greed is enough to explain away what's happened. Unqualified women and other DEI parasites who have found their way into our institutions, including government & healthcare, can certainly explain much of the incompetence. Big Pharma's stranglehold on MSM funding as well as their revolving door with their regulators can be entirely explained by greed.

If there is a conspiracy here, and I'm open to it, I'm not sure if humans are intelligent enough to orchestrate it. Like I said, I am open to it though and it does make sense from a big picture POV. Frankly, the filter they used was the perfect test.

If your job has HR make work, pointless meetings, multiple bosses and DEI you need to either quit or do the absolute bare minimum before finding a better job. And yes there are better jobs. My current gig has no HR, no Jews and exactly one token nigger. Two staff meetings a month. Clear scope and direction from one manager.

My experience has been the low paying wagie gigs tend to have more kikery so muh “at least they are paying me” is a cope. The higher they pay the less bullshit you should have to put up with so always ask for more money and if you don’t get it keep on the hunt. Otherwise live neetstyle. One of the benefits of no quality women to start families with is you don’t have the (((extra expenses))).

Yeah, in other words, Dems and Shitlibs don't want reconciliation, something both sides (one of which today's Dems and shitlibs claim to speak for) agreed upon to heal a divided nation. What it boils down to is just more anti-white propaganda, and the ever ever increasing attempt to erase this country's white past and replace it with today's DEI globohomo clown world narrative. Eventually they'll go after Rushmore, George Washington, or Abe Lincoln statues, simply because they're white.

Though, ironically, I agree with them: I'm finding myself not wanting reconciliation with this new government and the globalists taking over this country; who in turn gaslight us that we're somehow the problem for not approving of the slow dismantling of the country my forefathers built. I'm tired of being told I need to hate myself and disassociate myself with my people's collective identity and shared history, just to appease a bunch of people who secretly relish in our decline anyway. America really is the Great Satan now and I look forward to doing my part in NOT defending or fighting for it. All good things must come to and end.

>morality is relative
Oh okay, so if something offends you it's immoral? You're just as bad as the DEI nonsense being pushed by those who claim to be Jews. Morality is not relative, it is objective. Either something is a sin or it isn't. Since you aren't Christian and clearly aren't religious then your morality isn't based on anything except personal feelings. You might as well cut your testicles off and take estrogen because your method of orienting yourself is exactly how unprincipled women act. Furthermore you claim Christians lack responsibility for their actions while blaming them for perpetuating immorality instead of examining your own actions, which in itself is irresponsible and portrays lack of awareness combined with lack of accountability. Working 9-5 atomizing yourself from your family so Mr. Shekelburg can profit off of your labor is not virtuous nor is it honorable nor desirable, and such conduct is dishonoring to both your father and mother. Being a 'hard worker' is without worth when all of your wages are sin and your employer is the Devil.

Polish-American here. Yes, we do.

It's not like in Poland where it's clear the purpose of the Polish Military is to simply defend Poland in case of an attack and defend its borders. America is an empire with ~150 bases across the world across many countries and has diplomatic obligations to protect other countries in various exchanges (Saudi Arabia only sells Oil in USD, Germany promises never to have a military, etc.). So if an American Soldier joins the military, he isn't only defending America.

Unfortunately there are also additional and more selfish reasons. The last agreed-upon official legitimate war against Evil was WWII. Every war after until now has been clearly an unofficial war ("Military Action") we were lied into by our representatives for the Deep-State's (Unelected Officials, Interest Groups, etc.) and Politician's Personal Gains/Profits. Look at Ukraine - for Americans it's clearly a Money-Laundering conflict for the Oligarchs. Shit happening to Israel? AIPAC and Israel is calling in for what it has paid for. There are additional reasons (like how in recent years the USA Military talked mad shit against Non-Leftists and/or Whites under DEI yet now with 80-year record low numbers they shamelessly switch back to old school "merit"-based machismo advertising towards Non-Leftist Whites).

Yes, kolego - Americans legitimately hate our own military in it's current state. Even Military families are telling their current generations to avoid joining the Military.

But beta male bosses just will not reprimand bad employees who are women.
Yet males who are top 1% performers will be grilled if they make a small mistake, while earning the same as those women.

It is just humans naturally and subconsciously choosing the path of least resistance.
When you're a fat cuck with a bunch of personal issues, why summon the strength to properly chastise a female, when you know the odds are against you?

Poos want to replace white people as well, in fact, they're the primary drivers of DEI initiatives. Poos infiltrate organizations, both public and private sector, kiss ass to get into management, then shit on white and asian males while to get them canned, preach diversity to everyone else, then when their managers come in asking why they can't find anyone they kindly offer to import their extended cousins with assurances of being very highly skilled and cheaper than the white people, they just need those h1bs.

you could have a dupont general thread and it would go on for days, and attract the worst shills. they have been a cancer on the world for a long time. But notice how the MIC starts with them, but does not end with them? The finders cult was part of the MIC in two places: the founder was a veteran, and they taught computer usage to the CIA.

One of the aspects of the MIC is preferential hiring of veterans. you have to understand that this serves multiple purposes: it ensures that they have killers of questionable morals working for them, it gives them a network to push their wares, and it gives their minions a solidarity that other groups do not have. This is why it's been a problem since before the civil war.

One of the aspects of DEI is it gives the MIC an advantage over every other company, while destroying rivals. Dupont is a key point, because while we think guns and missiles with the MIC, the reality is that they make EVERYTHING. Since veterans fall under DEI, they don't deviate from their hiring. Not all veterans are in the MIC, only the unethical are.

California would cease to exist without the MIC. The coastal cities exist because of the MIC. they are the employers. This was by design. They were the first lobbyists. Shipyards, factories, rail yards: all exist as part of the MIC. These are also the higher paying jobs. Nations that have competing industries against them? well they fall under ITAR and have export controls.

The MIC is vague. This is by design, as it is a group of corporations that have found ways to bypass the law by providing some sort of critical service. They have rigged it so that most of the government spending goes to them.

Now an interesting caveat: We can't have a draft anymore, because the MIC would be affected. there are tooo many support industries that would be disrupted. These are also jobs that women avoid, so if a draft were to happen, it would suck out a vast majority of the lefts activists.

>E' morto a Parigi la notte scorsa, all'età di 100 anni, il filosofo e docente Toni Negri, storico leader di Autonomia Operaia durante gli Anni di Piombo.

>La notizia, annunciata ad alcuni media dalla moglie Judit Revel, è stata confermata all'ANSA da Oreste Scalzone, ex leader di Potere Operaio e punto di riferimento a Parigi dei fuorusciti italiani di quegli anni.

>Negri era nato a Padova il primo agosto 1923 ed è stato fra i più importanti teorici della sinistra extraparlamentare e del marxismo operaista, già a partire dalla fine degli Anni Sessanta. Muove i primi passi nella sezione padovana del Partito socialista, ma se ne allontana diventandone critico. Dopo aver dato vita al Movimento socialista indipendente e al mensile Quaderni rossi, Negri poi aderisce alla rivista Classe operaia, nata nel gennaio del 1964 proprio da una scissione interna al mensile. Nel frattempo, fonda nel 1961 anche una casa editrice - la Marsilio editore - insieme a Paolo Ceccarelli, Giulio Felisari e Giorgio Tinazzi.

>L'attività filosofica, intellettuale, ma anche politica di Toni Negri continua con Potere operaio, da cui uscirà nel 1973 con il convegno di Rosolina. Lo stesso anno Negri fonderà la rivista Controinformazione, ma soprattutto Autonomia Operaia, di cui sarà leader e principale teorico fino alla sua dissoluzione, nel 1979.

It's just one battlefront in the war against whites, but it's all very well thought out and planned by the jews and succeeding probably even beyond their most optimistic expectations. I think what they didn't anticipate is just how depraved white women really are at heart. It took literally 10 to 15 years to totally turn them against their own men and any semblance of decorum. Now white sorority girls at top universities are twerking just like niggers (and gorillas before them) for tik tok videos as if that's perfectly normal. It's the unholy triumvirate of jews, niggers and women rebelling against the white patriarchy. They need to be put back in line. Simple as

Whites are handicapped by allowing Jews into their "race". These Jews can band together and create things like BLM or DEI with no repercussions because if a non-jew white dares speak out he will be crucified by either the Jews in charge or their minority golems, ruining his life with no gain.

agreed, the twitter post in OP's post is literally retarded and made by someone using a definition of autism he made up based on pop psych bullshit.

anyone who has worked with actual autists, like nonfunctional or even relatively high-functioning individuals knows that it is not some kind of superpower or natural state, it is a spectrum of symptoms that can be absolutely debilitating and makes it extremely hard to lead anything resembling a normal life.

OP's twitter faggus means something like "light Asbergers" or "what tiktok calls autism which is just a slight stubbornness when it comes to resisting social DEI mandates and a tendency to fixate and focus in a cute but awkward way"

OP has too much cum up his nostrils to even think about these things though

There is nothing to be proud of if you are a millennial. Your generation created this woke shithole we live in today. It’s because of you that trans lgbtq and DEI indoctrination is part of grade school curriculum and 50% of women are man hating whores. Zoomers are the last hope of society as we caught only the tail end of it since millennials hadn’t fully infested lower academia until most were in highschool or middle school, so if pushed many of us to become conservative as it was an antithesis to the values we were raised with. I remember sitting in classrooms around 2012 when this shit started getting pushed and a good 40% of the class would talk about how much we hated fags and diversity bullshit afterwards. Even at university a few years ago, a big portion of students treated mandatory diversity training and seminars like a fucking disgusting joke. Such things are unheard of in the newest gen raised by millennials and would have been seen as crimes worthy of execution by millennials themselves

Utahfag here. Wasatch Front (stretch from Ogden in the north to Payson in the south as most boring town) is full of NPC mixed with Mormons and non-Mormon, some right and some leftist.

I assure you all public colleges and universities are hijacked by commies to brainwash students especially white majority to assume white guilt to commit race suicide and go full communist by voting Democrat as robots.

Utah have a closet faggot of a governor whose surname rhymes with "cock". Lt governor cunt supports vote fraud. Utah is a cuckservative state that's filled with corrupt stupid white Republican lawmakers who comply with what Mormon cult demands to pass the laws. Utah state constitution (Article I Section 4) prohibiting religious control of state is bullshit. Mormon church runs this fucking godforsaken state, but it's getting less Mormon as years go by thanks to degenerate migrants from CA and elsewhere and commies running K-12, school boards and higher education to push dual immersion (preferring Spanish and Chinese to indoctrinate white children to accept being conquered as subjects of future invasions), DEI and critical race theory bullshit.

Also, Mormon white chicks (blue eyes, blonde and brunette, slim and slender) are FUCKING HOT. But potentially INSANE.

Be careful, don't stick yo dick in crazy. Premium white pussy. No wonder NIGGERS and spics love coming to Utah just to smash white pussies.

Some of them love getting BLACKED and TACO'd. They end up marrying non-white shitskin men to have mongrel children with. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes has a white wife with mongrel children.

Also, fucking worst drivers in the country. Avoid driving during rush hours, y'all. I'm Uber driver and it's worse than ever in Salt Lake Co and Utah Co in the mornings before and after sunrise.

In my case, I was harassed out of a 75K job. So were 9 other white people the same year. What they do is put you in a DEI teams call every month and fire anyone who looks at them wrong or questions the narrative.

"Playing along" greatly benefits them. Blacks play the race card to hide behind their crimes and dodge responsibility. Streetshitters are ass kissers by nature, the caste system of their culture makes them excellent bootlickers for corpos and other greedy kikes. Spics know American "sympathy" for them is fake as fuck, but they know the government is geared up to pacify them with gibs instead of having potential blood and conflict on their hands. Asians are just taking advange of DEI shit, but they often find they get the short end of the stick in favor of other races (EX, nigs get a free pass to pummel Asians and there's no MSM pitty party like the ones that nigger felons get for getting smoked by pigs). They still know they have a sliver of "sacred cow" status, so they cling to it.

>Frank Moore Cross and Richard Elliot Friedman argue that the best candidates for both the Elohist and Deuteronimist are Levitical priests whose main shrine was located in the town of Shiloh, just north of Jerusalem on the border of Israel and Judah. Priests from Shiloh like Samuel and Jeremiah were not only priests but also prophets, which matches up with the Elohist’s interest in prophets. Cross and Friedman argue that the tension between Moses and his “brother” Aaron as presented in the Pentateuch is a symbol for the conflict between two different priesthoods: the Levitical priests who were descended from Moses, and the Aaronid priests of Bethel who were descended from Aaron. Cross argues that many of the contradictions within the Pentateuch can be answered “if we posit an ancient and prolonged strife between priestly houses: the Mushite priesthood which flourished at the sanctuaries of the local shrines at cArad and Kadesh opposed to the Aaronite priesthood of Bethel and Jerusalem” (Cross, Canaanite 206). Although the Aaronid Priest who wrote P tries to cover this division up by representing Aaron as a descendant of Levi, the Elohist makes no distinction between different Levitical priesthoods, leading Cross to believe that the Aaronid Priesthood was actually not related in any way to Moses and the Levites. Dever points out that neither the “Song of the Sea” from Exodus 15 nor the “Magnalia Dei” from Deuteronomy 26.5-10 mention Moses in connection with the Exodus, and that Jeremiah and Micah are the only prophets outside the Pentateuch that actually refer to Moses (Jer. 15.1; Mic. 6.4; Dever, Who 235-236)

>Cross explains that the golden bulls set up by king Jeroboam I in Dan and Bethel representing the traditional Levantine god El the Bull were most likely connected to the iconography of the Aaronid priesthood

>Embezzling isn't the issue
Prosecutors said in court documents that Furlow-Smiles used her position at Facebook to bring in vendors who were owned by friends and associates. Once Facebook signed off to onboarding them, Furlow-Smiles would inflate the expense reports to make extra money she had the vendors send back to her, prosecutors said.

"In these reports, she falsely claimed that her associates or their businesses provided goods and services to Facebook for various programs and events, when in fact they had not," prosecutors said.

Among those involved in her scheme were relatives, friends, former interns from a previous job, "nannies and babysitters," a hair stylist, and her college tutor, prosecutors said.

Furlow-Smiles used the fraud to pay $10,000 to an artist for specialty portraits and more than $18,000 for preschool tuition.

They keep claiming that Jesus was brown, but if you look at the skin color of people in the mideast, they're often very pale in many countries.

Even places like iran or lebanon, the Christian and jewish ones are VERY pale, literally getting sun poisoning easily. It's why they wear hijabs and such, to cover their skin.
Many of the mideast countries even have green or other colored eyes.

The genetics of the mideast is separated by religion usually.
With the darker skinned muslims descending from india initially
And the Christians and jews descending from Europe.

Although in places like Iran, and others, even the muslims are super pale skinned.
So, I guess it depends on when they converted from christianity
Even palestinians are often light white skin and green/blue/hazel eyes, with dirty blonde hair.

And in the mideast, it's the only place in the world where genetics are clearly defined based upon religion. In places like Lebanon, the Christians are the literal descendants of Phoenicians. This was even confirmed by DNA recently.

So, even 2000 years ago, Jesus was likely pale white skin, and could possibly had colored eyes. Despite the DEI push to make everyone brown/black these days
...even Santa Claus, which is a german creation I believe. So he definitely wasn't black, and definitely wasn't a cripple in a wheelchair like they're pushing hard this year. I'd love to watch lefties show me how a quadriplegic in a wheelchair is gonna get down a chimney, let alone back up.

I would argue that there will be a point where the european/american order will weaken to the point of no longer being able maintain their colonial ties to africa. That has been the only real thing other than maybe geographic factors holding back african industrialization. Once the U.S loses its world hegemon status its game on for africa. Its not gonna happen for a while though. western culture started dying when they started feeling guilty as a populace for various things. I.E when we became a nanny state for the world. This is a boomer caused and perpetuated problem. They saw the civil rights movement firsthand and as a reaction flipped way too hard the other way, which is where you get all the DEI shit from. It wasnt the oppresed people themselves pushing for it, it was lefty white boomers that felt guilty about muh racism and muh homosexuality, so they pushed to throw it in everything. Presuming that a generation primarily had parents from two generations prior, this is why millennials are very similar to the boomers in culture and why zoomers are more cynical and contrarian.

It is easy to understand.

America is a great country. Washington DC is populated by traitors, and professional groups collaborate with DC to rob the nation.

DEI is useful in displacing competent people so you can plant your own.

To see the effect of this, make an infographic of the highest salaries, by county, from 1970 to today. You will see that manufacturing areas paid the best 50 years ago, but the strong earnings are now concentrated around DC and Silicon Valley, with a lesser concentration in other coastal cities.

This is the work of the DC traitors and their thieving collaborators draining the nation of wealth to benefit themselves, and the CCP has been the greatest winner in this game.

China's future will be boring and predictable, a poorer version of Japan with decades of stagnation.
In the 80s America was manic about Japan dominating the future.
There won't be a collapse, they will in fact continue to make high tech products and will possibly start competing with companies like Nvidia at some point. Just - as a whole Chinese influence already peaked.

The main difference to Japan will be a horrifically low fertility rate. I think China will go below 1.0 relatively soon and meet South Korea eventually. Their TFR in 2022 was 1.09. There's something in those work-obsessed East Asian societies that makes them drop way below Western countries.

There's a wild card if China starts a war for some reason, but that's true of every country really.

He isn't wrong about America dominating the rest of this century. This entire board is retarded doomerism about America. Then I look at PISA 2022 results. Even American blacks score higher than Greece, a theoretically Western country. American Whites score higher than all but two European countries (to be fair, results for others include also immigrants).
DEI is already being phased out because Jews are pivoting away from the left after the support for Hamas. Objectively America is a wealthy country with a smart population, a leader in innovation and is continuing to brain drain the rest of the world.

There's a weird strain of self hate in Americans that's hard to understand. On one side liberals have this bizarre inferiority-superiority complex to few Western Euro countries (blah blah health care and walkable cities, but then muh racism). Then many right wingers vehemently hate America while waving the flag, because in their mind 'real' America is something radically different from what actually exist for close to a century now. It's anything from gold bugs to preferring to be ruled by Russia just to ban gay marriages. All these create demand for irrational doomerism.

Media has always needed a set of "bad guys". What I mean by that is an enemy that doesn't require moral analysis or thought. Some examples: The orcs and goblins from lord of the rings, stormtroopers from star wars, cobra soldiers from GI JOE, the fucking decepticons, etc. The problem is, the media has pushed that the only acceptable group of people that can play that villain role is "white people", and to get the normies on board it's always nazis.

Every other piece of media adds too much complexity when every warring faction is "the good guys but they're doing bad things because X reason". That's why they're shit. Regular people don't like it when they have to think about every villain onscreen, they just want to see bad guys who can be killed with impunity so the good guys win. We used to do this with WW2 movies but only so many of those can be made. We also used to do this with cowboys and indians. But now everyone screams "muh racism" if any particular "tribe" of people is the antagonists, even if they're a complete fantasy. "These orcs are just proxiez for black people!" Or "A classical green skinned witch with a big nose is a dog whistle for a jew!" I don't think that, and most people don't think that. Only true racists would make such claims, which is why all these DEI and woke folks are the obvious real racists, just trying to guilt the rest of us into giving up our wealth and rights.

I encourage you to carry the conversation about disability etiquette and awareness with you. It's an issue that needs to be discussed around every table in all board rooms where decisions are being made. It's important that children when entering social and educational environments be encouraged to learn about differences and how to properly engage with an individual living with disabilities and developmental delays.

Inclusion is an act, it's only a wish without action. The beautiful diversity among us gives us all an opportunity to learn more and be more aware of the needs of others. I believe all leaders could benefit from equity training. We all belong in Oklahoma; Oklahoma is for everyone. It's important for those making decisions for all of us that all are thoughtfully planned for and considered. Governor J. Kevin Stitt and the executive branch could benefit from learning about the federal rights that protect certain minority groups from incredibly blatant stupidity and personal harmful bias and agendas. From Early Head Start to any doctorate program in Oklahoma and beyond, DEI training and awareness is a good thing that good leaders embrace and implement.

I believe all lawmakers in the State of Oklahoma should be required to have basic 101 on the federal rights and reasons why we protect certain minority groups. I think by doing so taxpayers could save a lot on unnecessary legal fees when fellas like J. Kevin Stitt choose to blatantly ignore the federal rights of others in the name of leftist extremism.

It's a start, check it out. Share it with every college student you know and chat with your sweet kids about DIVERSITY, EQUITY, EQUAL RIGHTS, INCLUSION and BELONGING, and also those who fight against it.

JKS is a JOKE and embarrassment to Oklahoma.

Schools should be segregated. Polite, well-behaved niggers may be given sponsorships to learn in white schools, on the understanding that there is a zero-tolerence approach to niggering. Those niggers can become leaders among their own people, and try to advance them somewhat. That kid could have life changing injuries, if he survives, what was the point of him going to school? He'd be better off staying at home playing vidya and learning shit on YT, unironcially.
Truth is, niggers may be stupid, but they know how to push the limits, as criminals tend to. They know they can get away with bullying whitey, because law enforcement is a DEI mess. Well, enjoy it while you can, because the funtimes won't last forever. Seppos are alright, and I'm fairly sure will find their giant seppo balls eventually.

here's another way of thinking about it: how much has DEI score/adherence been considered a quality improvement to goods to adjust CPI? you'd be paying more at the store, but the government's reports would say the dollar is stable in value because you're getting BeTtEr, MoRaL quality from things. i'm pretty sure this has already been done with organic foods

Intelligence is being rewarded more than ever, and niggers aren't intelligent.

Colleges let them in then drum them out of stem. Employers hire them, then relegate them to the dumb shit jobs. Nobody respects them outside of being physically intimidating.

All the repetitive factory work has been offshored or 100% spics in there. All the good jobs now aren't physical. They are mostly mental. They get jobs that are actually suited to their ability, and theres 100 beaners there talking shit about them in Spanish all day til they get sick of it and quit. They get a DEI job, and everyone talks shit about them for being a useless parasite, and they quit. They work at a place thats all niggers and the business is terrible, the customers are all rude niggers, and the working conditions are toxic because the management treats everyone like a criminal (they have to because its all niggers).

They have no shot to do anything positive. America is changing and they simply do not have the mental traits to cope with it.

Personally I think we should raise military spending back to the cold war standard of 10-16% of our gdp, cut all of the military sops implemented post 1990 to get rid of DEI, and blow all of them except china off the map. Of course that would require actual strong leadership

Here's a little-mentioned fact: a lot of the DEI bullshit is being pushed by state pension funds, notably California. These funds are enormous and therefore have huge power, and they are run by leftard apparatchiks who don't need to turn a profit. They can therefore force the investment managers to select to push their woke bullshit.

Retail in the US would rather die bankrupt - begging for DEI-bux to save them - than hire the type of competent staff that makes self-checkout useless. Remember when self-checkout was mainly if you had a handful of shit and didn't wanna bug the express lane? People now use that shit because there's usually the express lane AND a normal lane only during rush hour, and you're guaranteed to be faster than the zoomer slowly-scanning each item

It doesn't help most stores are transitioning away from real employment because they're broke from their bullshit, Target doesn't even hire real 9-to-5's in my area anymore, and only have picrel, where they hire retards en masse to pick up the scraps from the people actually making a living there, an app is your supervisor instead of a real human. Naturally, the store's a dump with barely any employees that aren't cashiers or the customer service booth, yet even these on-demand jobs reject you within a day if you try applying because you aren't ethnic enough for these positions. Retail is dying, and retard decisions like this are why

Like all things, the future is unpredictable.

On the one hand, we have a mass embracing of degeneracy, just to see how far it can go. AI art is just the tip of the iceberg. Soon (within a decade) we'll have the first true sex-robots (AI driven machines that are hyper-realistic real dolls). They will be jank and shitty at first but over the next 30 years, they'll improve to the degree that they are seamlessly "realistic".

They will never be "real" however, they will hit a spectrum of the uncanny valley that is intensely stimulating to the male human brain. Literally, they will look like "anime and video game" characters but you will be able to touch and "play" with them.They will have saliva, sweat, and a "taste" that is unique but almost addictive. They will literally be "better" than human women in every objective way.

Combine this with male birth control (set for 2024-25 for the US) that is effective, and you suddenly have a massive pendulum swinging the other way in the sexual marketplace. Birth Control and modern appliances liberated women. The role of women had been taken away and they were none the wiser, thinking themselves "freed". A "smart" home is more efficient and effective at maintaining a household than any woman. With advances in androids, wives will no longer be needed to fulfill sexual needs. Women have been projecting for 30-40 years, insisting they were still necessary when in reality, there was just no alternative to sexual fulfillment that wasn't emasculating or self-destructive. Without that, feminism would have never taken root.

With male birth control, women will lose access to male seed. They are locked out of reproduction unless they can convince a man to get his BC reversed.

Combined with the socio-political spectrum swinging against "feminine" politics (DEI, LGBTQ+, Postmodern Neo-marxism, Technocratic Hermeticism, and so on) and things get VERY interesting.

I just want my Tifa-bot and focus on my career as an analyst.

That’s not how things actually work in practice. This BS is encouraged through law, and regardless of productivity losses, many, if not most, corporations will keep doing it, albeit perhaps more discreetly, if only to avoid the compliance costs of lawfare. And you’re underestimating how leveraged and financialized the economy as a whole is; the NASDAQ requires companies meet DEI goals to be listed, and we’re probably just one more Summer of Floyd level chimpout away from the S&P following suit. And some of the largest investment banks, like Blackrock, Vanguard, etc. are doing the same thing. Most companies are downstream from that process. It’s not their individual decision to make.

Remember, culture is downstream from law, the law encourages this shit, and the corporate policies that drive it have the force of law within, and often even without, the organizations. For example, during the Summer of Floyd, when all of this really began accelerating, the NASDAQ started imposing DEI requirements for listing. Blackrock does so as well, or at least heavily encourages it, as do other investment banks like Vanguard. And despite the recent SCOTUS ruling against affirmative action in college admissions, they’ll still find loopholes, if they aren’t vigorously prosecuted. It can’t be stopped by merely having corporate takeovers in a handful of companies. It must be stopped with the force of law. Unless all of us are demanding this of politicians during primaries, we aren’t demanding nearly enough from them.

The surveillance of which you speak is largely done by globalist corporations, not by Muh Gubmint.
The Uniparty refuses to deal with that.
By and large I haven't given much of a shit if NSA is listening to me, because they at least used to require high IQs to become a wizard/warlock.
Now, God alone knows, but we assume GS DEI rot has inflicted them as well.
But I have no idea what private intel is listening or what they're doing with that information.
And there's no way to get at that shit, because Proprietary Data.

So the surveillance thing is a lot more complicated than your thinking about it is. You are setting up the usual Thumbfagging pinata of Muh Gubmint to wack. But that's not the real problem.

Anyone on the right fighting against DEI right now is absolutely retarded. This is a leftist civil war between POC and Jews who want to be dealt back into the DEI victim stack. Any genuinely right wing person should not only not involve themself in a leftist civil war but should hope the DEI side wins this. Better that your enemy are stupid monkey people than Jewish technocrats. That said this is a fait accompli. The leftist march through the institutions is accomplished. Leftist Jews are going to try and pivot to the right in an attempt to shift it leftward and make it a pro-Sodomy party. Think the Dave Rubin party.

You just said a mouthful. But, there’s more. A university I do work for went hog wild a couple of years ago creating an Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, hired an overpaid officer for it who pulls the same sway (and pay, I’m sure) as the dean of student affairs, and this officer of course needed a full staff, and of course each college of science or arts or whatever hired their own DEI “ambassadors” who also needed staff, and let’s not forget the DEI specialists for the HR department, plus all of the expensive mandatory DEI training all university faculty and staff are forced to complete to keep their jobs… Well, ANYWAY, this university sent out an email to EVERYBODY (just in time for Christmas) that there will be changes made in the coming months (i.e., heads will roll) because enrollment is down and the university is over budget. They’re just going to go from department to department pulling bones from an already skeleton crew, while leaving the piles of DEI fat to stink up the place. They’re also going to enforce enrollment minimums, further overcrowding classrooms and overworking cheap grad assistants and adjuncts who are paid slave wages. All they’re doing is killing quality while fattening the most useless beasts on that campus.

Top doctors are not going to be black. Even with DEI, it's hard for hospitals to allow blacks to fuck up surgeries, because hospitals are scrutinized for results. They can't afford to let Tyrone larp as a heart surgeon.

If you have a serious medical problem, go to the best hospital you can, regardless of where it is. Don't be like, "Oh my local shitty hospital in a ghetto says they can do this surgery. Do some research on the best hospital for what you want done, and go there.

Because our society no longer values human life.

For the past 60 years the West has been conditioned to see human life as disposable. This is undoubtedly due to the acceptance of abortion, contraception, sexual promiscuity, gender ideology, the destruction of the traditional family, the removal of Christ from public life, drug abuse, euthanasia, materialist philosophy such as Marxism and many other deeply Malthusian evils.

Marxism and Malthusianism see human beings not as unique souls made in the Imago Dei but as numbers that can be discarded at any time. We refuse to see every unique human being as being precious to God. This is why we have rampant government tyranny, inflation, destruction of nations, school shootings, fentanyl deaths and more.

Faculty & Staff =/= Administrators

Admin bloat is inhumanly bad now. Every college had two or three dozen different administrative departments now and every single one of them has a head, every head has three or four assistants, every assistant has a support team of five or six people, etc. Our DEI group employs two dozen people and all their department does is send emails no one reads and file reports no one looks at.

Actual department staff right now is pitiful. Our department was forced to downsize from four support staff to one, and from sixteen faculty to nine. We're stretched so thin we've had to switch to offering some of our required major courses alternating years. Staff and faculty levels at most schools have dropped by 50% compared to where they were 20-30 years while administrative hiring is up 50-100% over the same timeframe.

>receive state gibs in the form of bullshit jobs

I work with the state a lot in Oregon (social services) and it's like a pool filter for all the useless women to get jobs in. These are basically sinecures, too, but I don't think the women can keep even them because it looks like the positions are still turning over. For instance, there are two relatively intelligent women in one office who basically herd almost 20 retarded females (ALL female) and these women usually have DEI bonuses attached, like bearded trans 'men', black (not many in our town), or mystery meat mutts. They get good pay and all sorts of benefits but they're close to braindead.

Religion is as strong as ever, it just simply changed. We now worship planet Earth instead of a god. Ten commandments have been replaced by DEI guidelines. Science has replaced the church.

It's all the same bullshit, for the same reasons, but liberals are too fucking stupid to notice.

You're looking at it too deeply. It's just a symptom of the DEI fad, which requires that women are treated equally with men. Ergo, a woman's game is equal to a man's game and must be promoted as such. Their problem is that numbers don't lie: there's no market for most women's sport.

I just love how they created the monster that's going to destroy them.

They subverted the west into Weimar Germany, and now they're watching their DEI diversity mutts turn on their master.

They created the monster, and now the monster is going to destroy them

This time around, the empathetic white christians won't be there to save them

They abused the white man too much, and this time around, when Nazi Westmerica comes to it's power, Holocaust 2.0 won't just be 6 gorillian of them. It'll be all 17 gorillion of them.

They've abused every group too much, and their control of the media can't stop the flow of information this time.

Pissrael is simply showing the world, that they truly are genocidal monsters. That all their propaganda is lies, which is redpilling normies that everything else was also lies

It's opened the floodgates, to allow all the true factual history to be disseminated to the masses.
Shattering the realities that the west was lied into believing.

Be afraid. Be very afraid.
The white man won't be coming to your rescue this time around...

>I doubt it's having as much of a drastic effect on the black populace in america as the white as it keeps fucking growing despite higher rates of homicide, heart disease and yes abortion.

Our culture no longer values human life.

For the past 60 years the West has been conditioned to see human life as disposable. This is undoubtedly due to the acceptance of abortion, contraception, sexual promiscuity, gender ideology, the destruction of the traditional family, the removal of Christ from public life, drug abuse, euthanasia, materialist philosophy such as Marxism and many other deeply Malthusian evils.

Marxism and Malthusianism see human beings not as unique souls made in the Imago Dei but as numbers that can be discarded at any time. We refuse to see every unique human being as being precious to God. This is why we have rampant government tyranny, inflation, destruction of nations, school shootings, fentanyl deaths and more.

Contraception and abortion need to be banned immediately and Christ needs to be reinstated in our culture. Do whatever you need to do in order to make this happen before it's too late.

Or to only manufacture black baby dolls. I attended a workshop a few weeks ago on accessibility (making documents e-reader friendly for the blind). Almost all of the women presenting were filler and useless, no technical information at all, and would meander off into DEI territory and tell us, in a nutshell, to not include white people at all in photos to avoid giving off the impression of “checking off inclusion boxes.” I believe they said that “people who are used to seeing themselves represented won’t notice when they are not.” I wish she had been in SAMs club with me last week.

This is true, but is that really a redeeming factor, considering what kind of sun worship this is?

Some interesting things were happening in Roman empire, while Christianity "officially" didn't leave any imprint on ongoing events.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalus
>Since the reign of Septimius Severus, sun worship had increased throughout the Empire.
>Elagabalus was then entitled in Latin: sacerdos amplissimus dei invicti Soli Elagabali, pontifex maximus
>That a foreign god should be honored above Jupiter, with Elagabalus himself as chief priest, shocked many Romans.
>house Elagabal, who was represented by a black conical meteorite from Emesa
>"this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven..."
>in order to increase his piety as high priest of Elagabal atop a new Roman pantheon, Elagabalus had himself circumcised and swore to abstain from swine
This is few centuries before "official" emergence of Islam btw

After intense expansion southward, Roman empire took in way more arab population that it could digest, and it resulted in arabization of Romans instead of Europeization of arabs. At one point it became so bad, a dynasty of arabs from around Carthage became Roman emperors, and one of them brought into Rome a black stone which they were worshiping as one and only god. Where do Christianity fits into that? There are no proof that it existed at all back then, and wasn't made up retroactively during mutations that "Sol Invictus" arab religion was going though before becoming 3 abrahamic religions of modern era.

>why is the american rightwing obsessed with making more niglets?
1. Niggers mostly end up in the clink -- educated, affluent, or otherwise -- and prison niggers are a prime source of free labour (see: Penal Industrial Complex; more prisons built than universities; literal Senators having their homes built and maintained by criminal "chain gangs" etc.).

2. More niggers = more faux 'justification' for Larry's laughably disguised subversion tool, "DEI" to be fist-fucked into every orifice of the goy society; and negrification must begin at a cultural level -- mutt 'culture' being 99% staring box displaying moving images.

3. A negrified Muttmeria = and eventual and inevitable negrified world (analogy: a McDonalds / Hungry Jacks on every street corner throughout the globe).

4. While goys are fighting their niggers, the kike can run amok (analogy: an immune system that is busy fighting spike proteins, allows cancers to propagate).

3. Edom must fall.

The real issue, as with any other group, is refusal to assimilate. Unlike some other groups, most burritos have enough European DNA in them to be thoroughly bleached within a generation or two without affecting the average IQ too much. They just have too much retarded pride in their shitholes and backwards customs (just like the poos), and DEI culture rewards this silliness.

If you left your shithole to come here, stop pretending it’s the best country in the world.

Lower school standards, lower quality education, single parent households, fake food diets, just simply caring less, you name it.


I mean, if you’re a white kid growing up in some rusted out podunk town in Pennsylvania or Ohio or wherever, why should you even care? Even if you were top of your class, you’re going to get tossed aside in college admissions for a black woman that faced systemic racism. Even if you go to a good public university, you’re going to get a white collar job with no room for advancement that barely pays the bills. So why give a shit? Why try at all? In just a few generations, this country went from “anything is possible” to “nothing can be done” and people feel that. Between regulations, laws, credentials, Human Resources, affirmative action, DEI, immigration, off-shoring, outsourcing, automation, and the obvious incentive to suppress wages is the most stifling academic professional environment that has ever existed on this planet. You think the top 10% of white students realistically have a chance of working their way into a tenure track job if they wanted it? No. It’s not on the table.

"Two of those killed, Cha Jan “Jerry” Chang and Patricia Navarro Velez, were members of the business school faculty. The other two victims have not been identified."
A surviving shooting victim was a 38-year-old visiting professor. He was hospitalized at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. Police believe he was on the fifth floor of Beam Hall when he was shot.
Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Anthony Polito, 67, a former professor who had been denied positions at Nevada universities, was armed with a handgun and target list when he came to the Las Vegas campus on Wednesday morning. Polito, a Henderson resident, was later killed in a shootout with UNLV police outside Beam Hall, home of the business school. McMahill said two of the victims were killed on the building’s third floor, and one was killed on the fourth floor.

You repeat this jewish nonsense over and over again on 4chan last 10 years, the only choice you have is double down, because every single anti european sentiment is built on the fraud concept of 'white' and 'white supremacist' that have been bombarded non stop in the heads of american retards. If you change that defintion, you can throw away all that indoctrination entirely, because it breaks it. And you ask europeans, they don't call themselves 'whites' they call themselves french and british and germans and whatever else, these are the names of their races. It's not like USA which is a hodgepodge of all the retards of the world who don't know what the fuck anything is and then just decided to make shit up. It's why they are called ANCESTRAL LANDS or ROOT RACES. the ones that live there have lived there for thousands of years. The nations sometimes changed names but the people remained pretty much the totally same. Each nation state is infact a preserve for a particular group and for most people and countries in the world, that is where that specific type lives and they mostly unless they have made colonies don't exist fucking anywhere else.

I can see why you are upset ADL, you stuck between a rock and a hard place, now because israel got targetted due to your own stupidity, as a 'white supremacists apartheid state'. Now you got to unravel dei, affirmative action and also 'white supremacist' and the fraud concept of 'white' and 'brown'.

And then the trick is, you then narrow that to only being people with light skin and blue eyes and i guess blonde hair. And put everyone else in 'poc' now you have subdivided europe falsely you have taken straight up european groups put them in 'poc' category too. So now all euro americans of those groups lives in USA are not 'whites' either and are 'poc'.
This endless shit about south europeans, or how slavs aren't white russians aren't white this or that. You ever seen a fucking russian before? look like a fucking swede in terms of pigmentation, because pigmentation is UVA, they fucking near north pole people.
They did this swindle, and then they have now fucked themselves and become part of the collateral damage, and a target themselves with the stupid monster they themselves created.
If DEI and Affirmative action 'positively discriminates' against jews same as british and german americans and so on. Now jews ofcourse hate that shit. And they are angry that it's being used against israel aswell.
Muslims who are clever manipulators saw that scam too they were pulling and said
>we going to use this against these stupid american jews, and we going to implicate israel as a white supremacist state, this works perfect for us, now we have the americans trying to take down israel for us. Because they have been taught to hate british americans and euro americans and call them 'whites' and we know they can't fucking tell these jews in israel apart when all they focus on is pigmentation like fucking retards.
And it worked! Look at all these students, look at tiktok etc. which jews are angry about.
They all got maximum played by the muslims. Who used jews on trick used against british americans, against the jews themselves.
>down with israel, white supremacist apartheid state, got to defend the brown people the arabs.
So now they got to unravel, dei, affirmative action and the concept of 'white supremacy' and 'white nationalism' or jews are targetted.

>It was always about destroying white Gentiles and nobody else. That Jews are getting serious pushback from the various diversity agendas is the reason they are speaking out about it now. It was Jews building a Diversity Golem to get rid of whites but that golem has now turned on them.
they are trying to get rid of euro americans in USA. it's why they came up with 'white' and 'brown' and the 'people of color', to then put all euro americans as 'whites' whilst themselves masquerading as whites when they want to and jews when they want to.
And then they have risen this anti european sentiment to a feverish pitch so much that now they don't give a fuck now they use this label 'white' to attack both israel and american jews. as 'evil white men'. And so now they don't qualify for DEI and affirmative action anymore either.
That's why they are angry and it's so fucking obvious. It's because they know also being targetted by the same token for being 'white' looking.
They trying to get rid of the various european subspecies in USA, they not trying to get rid of light pigmented arabs, their cousins, or persians or anyone else like that who have light pigmentation similar to a lot of europeans.
That you at this point fucking still use 'white' shows how ridiculous you are about this whole thing and how they could fool you. It's relativizing europeans to a narrow group of having extreme light pigmentation, putting also europeans and everyone else in 'poc' ingroup. ANd then saying 'go fight the white supremacists'. Whilst the jews themselves fucking look like vanilla ice a fuckton of them.

'white' relativizes european groups, and you can lump them in with persians, light pigmented arabs, mestizos whoever you like that you claim is 'white' passing. Now you are protecting or preserving nobody you're mixing them together criss cross and also preserving neither and also blending them with people from different continents.

yep and now it's hurting jews, now jews are discovering just saying 'i'm not white i'm jewish' is no longer working, because now they only see pigmentation and differentiate race based on that (aka fraud) so now they can't tell jews apart. Now jews have percieved enough whiteness, because half of the rich jews in USA look like vanilla ice in terms of pigmentation. That now they targetted like john smith aswell under the DEI regime.
And ofcourse it's true, but these jews knew all about it, they didn't use to be the target, the british americans were and other euro american racial groups. Now it's targetting jews also. Because they've built up this 'white supremacist' nonsense up to a fever pitch in american society so now that has started to happen. Now they don't give a fuck if they are jew or british or german or whatever. You got light pigmentation. FUCK OFF time for some more 'brown' people

Well it was only a problem when jews specifically were targetted. It's funny. Jews are semites from middle east and are as thus extremely light pigmented and easily confused with europeans and persians and russians and other lighter pigmented groups. Is why they came up with 'white' to not self identify as jewish or judean, including changing their names to european sounding names.
But then they fucked up and came up with this 'white supremacist' and 'white nationalist'. And this is hurting them bad. because this is now being applied to israel. Because the dumb americans who have been trained with this, now see only pigmentation and pigmentation isn't race/subspecies. And what do they see in israel. A lot of light pigmented people, the israeli jews. And in gaza, there's dark pigmented or 'browns' aka default in USA lingo 'oppressed' people. And so israel is a 'white supremacist apartheid state'.
>wait wait, this is not what is supposed to happen, you only supposed to go after the british americans and you know the germans and french and people like that.
Who btw. are often darker pigmented than jews themselves. Especially jews in USA who look like fucking vanilla ice. Take a look at the fucking rich jews in USA and notice how light pigmented they all are in both hair skin and eyes.
Now they have accidentally become the target of their own bullshit label! Including the entire nation state of israel. AND jews are being also targetted via DEI as 'white supremacists' or 'rich white folks'. And so now they are targetted by DEI.
And so the jew is like.
>let's forget about this DEI
they going to throw out affirmative action too? i can't wait to see what happens next, because they also a target in that.
They can try the
>i'm jew

>i have been saying this shit for years and no one ever made a 4chan post about me
ofcourse, you are just stating the obvious facts. It has been said for decades about affirmative action aswell.
Also another word for affirmative action is positive discrimination. Works exactly same way. It should be for vulnerable people like handicapped and things like that, but has in USA been extended to include simply being of another race and being completely fucking healthy and normal in every way. this is now giving them an unfair edge. They now have better chance of being hired than literally anyone else, simply because they are not the majority of the population. The ability for small foreign groups in a country to exploit this for nepotism, including jews is IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS. and jews in USA all voted for it and have used it to corner academia and many other things, because by hiring nothing but jews to a lot of the slots
>we're hiring minorities bruh.
So why now? Because now they want to use DEI to discriminate against jews in USA which are completely hypocritical. So now all this which went without saying for decades and morphed into things like DEI is now
>nah we no longer doing that, are you crazy you are favouring specific people.
Yes, and this means also now favouring other people for no other reason than they aren't jewish.
So now the guy goes into a meltdown.
>isn't that hypocritical though, what are jews even, are white, are we jewish? are we minorities? not?
Well it all depends what subspecies you are aside from being judaism practitioner doesn't it. Now suddently he act confused about it.
So what's going on. It's obvious, jewish americans are being negatively discriminated against with DEI, aka other races are being favoured than them.

But ofcourse what he's saying other than tippytoeing around different subspecies of the planet, is correct, it's hiring based on race. You are kicking out europeans or the main group and putting in whoever the fuck you declare a 'minority'. So you're discriminating against the main race of that country. And you are hiring people solely for being of another race. This btw. creates a loophole for any small group to practice hardcore nepotism. Indians or jews or someone who is a 'minority' can then hire nothing but jews or indians for tonnes of positions. And then later fill in the rest with euro americans and whoever else.
This gives the 'minority' a better chance to get hired than anybody else! It's no mystery how jews liked that idea. The exploitation potential becomes immediately apparent.
And now they want to kick out jews using DEI and jews are like.
>noo let's no longer do that, btw. we own most of the companies anyways, kicking jews out? nah i don't like this DEI anymore, go fuck yourself africans mexicans and asians and whoever else. You not going to go in before a jew, now we going by qualification only, and also jews that i like.
Also euro americans have just become a minority in USA recently they are 48% of population (less than 50% in 2017) and should qualify for DEI. NOW THEY CAN'T! ROFL

Cool, company overall loses $3billion, people get laid off, and execs get mountains of cash and the remainder of workers get told to chill out on expenses and costs. This is why I don't give a fuck about costs anymore. If I cost the company an extra $5000 this year its literally pennies compared to exec bonuses.

Its not "woke", its Critical Theory, its a fucking serious antitruth, antiscience, antifamily, antiwhite, antiwestern, and antichristian cancer that has infected law, hiring, education, and even medical bodies.
Saying "woke" is meant to distract away from the source.

It's really easy. Most schools have had a DEI credit requirement for a long time now. People who like those types of classes and are good at repeating the arguments are encouraged to go further.

Give meetings and workshops about the latest politically correct jargon and rituals, police private conversations, write emails.

DEI has already poisoned the workplaces and most government jobs still use it vigorously.

I'm an expert in my field and the past 3 job interviews I've done spent half the time talking to baboon secretaries about DEI. They then proceeded to give the jobs to apes right out of "college" instead of qualified people.

Fifteen years ago when I started mine I'd have told you 'yes'. But that was before our economy started actively hiring foreign academics and specialists over domestic ones. I finished an experimental physics PhD in 7 years, got four publications, but I struggled to get a fucking adjunct job after graduation because every single posting now is looking for applicants who tick off all the fucking DEI boxes. Barely landed a teaching prof position at a private school, make median wages and have had to give up basically any chance of doing productive research again because of all the shitpile of stuff dumped on me every year.

Everyone knows already, that's the demotivating part. The school knows, university administration knows, the board knows, the state knows.

Yeah, devaluing is a very tricky thing to do because you have to damage it enough to get a significant devaluation, but you can't let the thing burn to the ground because on the grave marker will always be "they got too woke".

When a mega company like Disney does DEIBJ shit its because they're looking for cheap loans from someone even bigger than them. Banks don't give a fuck because they like money more than any virtue signalling. Places like Vanguard, State Street, Black rock have enough wherewithal to know they can leverage their cash/loans/funding with DEI knowing they'll just have control over the borrower. You want another $500 billion to keep your company going? Sure, but you're going to do xyz because theres only 2 other entities on the planet that can loan you that much.

My engineering department has been denied for a new hire five years running and have been consistently told through back channels by our DEI office that they could "create" the position without the approval process if we would simply agree to only consider 'diverse applicants'. Our department has consistently told them to fuck off. We're not opposed to any applicants if they meet the qualifications and are a good fit for the department, but we're not going to play this bullshit political game where if we just agree to exclude White guys they can move some things around and stop blockading the process.

I lost a job to a minority once. I think the job wasn't as comfy as her old so I applied again and got the job. It was salaried. The management was stressful, the customers could be unruly, the health insurance was utter shit, and my time was nonexistent. I could have had a better quality of life working three wagie jobs and still had more time.

I watched a regular dumb woman fail upward to a regional manager and nobody had a good opinion of her or her work product so they would just promote her away. She was laid off recently. As was the chief DEI officer at home office. Her resume was the following:
>executive assistant $40k/year
>Chief DEI officer $220k/year
She had that job for about 18 months before they realized she didn't do anything other than send emails demanding more trannies, gays, lesbians, and non whites in the office as numbers across the board suffered.

When the failing news outlets are declaring DEI is dead because people aren't that stupid yet, its either on a long pause, or its actually dead and has been for months by those trying to implement it. Almost every major company hired a chief DEIB officer. During this recession and so many companies laying off 10-15% of its staff, the DEI people were first to go. They were with my company anyway, then workers doing actual work too.

israel had nothing to do with it; companies saw they weren't getting enough money or future money for adhering to DEI nonsense compared to the consumers telling them DEI is fucking retarded. Interest rates went up too so guaranteed loans in the future from big boys like vanguard meant nothing when companies are losing billions today.

As for the failing medical system, that comes from personal experience dealing with the SSI medical system in central California with my mothers failing health. I literally had to move her to Oklahoma and pay for her surgery because she wasn't eligible for a surgery dealing with her aortic infarction. Basically the doctors in Cali were going to let her die because she wasn't brown enough to fill their fucking quotas
Socialized medicine is a fucking cancer and literally lets people die to fill their fucking DEI narratives.

Pretty easy.

1) Revert women rights or promote traditional families and incentives.
2) Make aipac and double citizenship illegal for politicians.
3) Severely restrict illegal immigration and make legal immigration a lot easier for good standing people, specially Europeans
4) Stop DEI and promote meritocracy

Everything should fix itself after that, no more pointless wars and no more incelism.

It isn't 4D chess. It's competency crisis due to DEI/white replacement in the workforce. They really failed to account for how much worse the new golem were at their jobs than the old. As pajeets have been handed the reins to online censorship they have fucked it up. A lot of it is because that while poos are outwardly servile they are inwardly incredibly jealous and full of rage that stems from feelings of inferiority. They may be failing partially on purpose. 10-15 years ago there would have been no Epstein/Maxwell story. There would have been no Biden laptop. There would have been no story about the US blowing up the pipeline. Normies would still believe in Snake Island and the Ghost of Kiev. There would have been no 2020 election fraud coverage. There would be no AIPAC/ADL/Zionism talk running counter to the MSM narrative that brave oppressed jews are boldly rolling into these walled-in racial prison favelas in American tanks and bravely filling civilian hospitals with white phosphorous rounds because of the Holocaust and Anne Frank and the mountain of shoes.

We still live in the Matrix, but the update coders are now streetshitters. They are breaking it.

They were always going to be in a precarious situation at some point in white replacement. At some point they were going to have to change horses midstream, going from the "hello fellow white people" routine to the "hello fellow oppressed minorities, who I am king of because I am most oppressed" routine. Some of them are going to fall off while in transition. Maybe all of them. They are in a precarious position.

This is a government employer so I felt on solid ground. Then DEI came to my department meeting promoting "equity".... with picrel, I asked "How did the short guy get the box?". They wrote me up for discrimination (accusing colored of stealing) and withheld my bonus.

I don't care about the opinions of some dead guy, I make my own observations, and my observations tell me that Slavs have been in Europe for thousands of years and fit right into the European family of phenotypes. The only problem, historically, with Slavic countries, has been kikes. Old world Eastern Europe has some of the most beautiful architecture in Europe, and for most of history they were more advanced than Scandinavians. Only when the kike weaseled its way into power did their countries stagnate and become rootless shit-holes under bolshevism. The same people who today in Western Europe, USA, Canada, and Australia, tell us about "white privilege" and "systemic racism," who promote demographic replacement and DEI.

Holy fuck I hope these rich white leftists in our government and the Jews get us nuked at this point.
The only thing keeping this together is the threat of violence and imprisonment from the state. The only thing protecting these rich kid fuckers and Epstein clients is the state. The only thing protecting Antifa terrorists is the state. The only thing protecting any of these people is the state. Once it's gone, no police will show up to save them. No court will crucify you for self-defense.

Am I wrong to assume this is a self-correcting problem? Our elite clearly want a war. They will start one. And they are literally too incompetent to win one.
