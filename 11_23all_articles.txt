Don't get your hopes up
It's just that they need more niggers for DEI gibs and very few of them actually go to college

A few reasons they could be doing this:

They can't meet DEI goals with it in place. Not enough niggers and other shitskins can graduate even though entrance is heavily tilted in their favor.

Another reason could be it's gotten so expensive that their hires expect enough pay to cover rent and their loans. If you hire someone without loans they are going to be willing to work for less.

Degrees have lost value in that they
>decreased graduation requirements for low IQ shitskins
College initially was where the best and brightest went. Then it became something that everybody had to go to so it is no longer the IQ test (as you're not allowed to give actual IQ tests) that it de facto served in place of.

I got out 9 years ago. Recruiting difficulties have really only cropped up in the last 5.
It's lost its prestige. From a purely outside perspective now, the military is run like absolute dogshit.
It's full of woke DEI nonsense, which leads to it being non-meritocratic.
Because the average E-1 is in worse physical shape, basic is easier. The psychological aspect is toned way down, which is not a good thing.

Also spending time on this board, wading through an ocean of bad faith and shitposting but eventually finding what lies here, has made me really question who pulls strings in the western world and what role the military plays in that.
For example, there's an incredibly coherent case to be made that World War II was a pre-planned culling mechanism for conservative-leaning primarily white men capable of violence.
The concept of the zogbot is very plausible, and it's suspicious enough to the point that I would dissuade young men from signing up to fight anywhere other than on American soil.

This is just leftist Taqqiya leftists are very visibly in favor of none of those things. We see the DEI and leftist support for them we see antifags attacking our heritage we Kikes attacking our Gods and our traditions. Fascist states can offer all he asked and do not want to destroy our people our nations and our heritage. You have nothing to offer but an expanded welfare economy our labor will pay for to live at the same level as less productive people we would otherwise look down upon in the name of “equity.”

This is the struggle of a people against a parasite class that loves to create new hypnotisms to set you against your brethren. “Oh anon you believe in free healthcare! See you’re a leftist like me now help me teach these kids about how they can start their transition! Will I see you at the BLM rally.” These people are our enemies they stand on one side to profit from you and they other to see guilt in you. Never negotiate just destroy.

I figured out an analogy to compare the US and Russia today. Think of Russia and America each as two large Victorian era sailing ships. Each has a large crew with assigned duties at sea.

The Russian ship has been out at sea for a very long time and has been through some major hellish storms that almost surely would have wrecked anyone else. In fact it almost wrecked the Russian ship but each time the crew showed incredible discipline, skill, and resilience. Not only did they study at the academia but they proved themselves on the job. After each storm the rigging was fixed, the sails patched, the bilge drained and dried. Sure the ship is battered visually and the sails are faded but the crew has proven itself, it can tolerate the seas, it can sail, and it can work together under stress.

The American ship and its crew have never been through a major storm. They have read about major storms, trained for one storm in a simulation. They read about the storms their ancestors went through 100 years before. They can sail and are lucky with long streaks of good weather. On the rare occasion they hit somewhat rough waters they are fine. However the crew has lost site of what's important. The standards are lax across the board. The Captain, the Lieutenants are now DEI political appointees (they did not work their way up the crew unlike on the Russian ship). The bilge is leaking, the ship is starting to slightly list. The rigging is not being maintained, but it still all works. Yet the ship keeps moving. Little things that can be fixed are not. The few onboard who are trainees (midshipmen) are not listened to when they make their concerns known to command. The Captain is an old man with dementia and the 1st Lieutenant is a woman who got her position by giving the captain a blowjob. Some strange inertia of luck and just-enough-skill in a few hands keeps the boat upright but the issues are starting to pile up and those few who bring them up are denounced and punished.

I’m a lawyer, and I’ve made a shitload of money doing it.

Fucking don’t, nigger. Run away, the profession sucks. You’re going to go $150k in debt to get a law degree that is, at best, a crapshoot at good money, and only if you do well.

Then you’ll get to slave for shekels for 80+ hour weeks. The DEI/black worship at big law firms and corporate law departments is off the charts bad; there aren’t any based ones out there worth a god damn.

If you hit the jackpot and make partner, you’ll realize it is even worse, because you’re constantly getting jewed out of what you earned by some elderly fucking boomers who haven’t worked themselves in 20 plus years, sucking up to corporate assholes for crumbs of work, all while having to justify your existence if you’re not a disabled troon negress.

But that’s not the worst part. The worst part is that, like /pol/, you’re here forever. Law is NOT mobile. You will be stuck in whatever clown world hellhole city you started out in, unable to move to the suburbs, let alone to a better state, without absolutely destroying your career. And all those boomer assholes who are like “huh huh a law degree opens a lot of doors!”? How many of those fuckers actually have a law degree?

Just fucking run away, before you end up a middle aged wreck posting on 4chan like me.

if anything its easier, they just add 1's and 0's to x (jews) account and make a note to write an iou, call up the fed, print money, send it to bank y.

the complications begin at the lower levels of the infrastructure, i.e. the gutter jews. the gutter jews have to come up with inventive ways to multiply their handouts, likely their stipened. this is where the book sales [actually a million books being burned in a landfill in china], record sales [actually just a bunch of bots spamming itunes with preloaded giftcards, art sales [(((appraising))) a piece of art at 50x its value, selling it to your brother for $1], property sales [see art sales, epsteins ny mansion purchased for $1]

dei worked because a) all money comes from jews b) jews own all those companies anyways. for the few goyim still in the game who think theyre on team jew, who havent pledged their bloodlines to jews like trump and biden and most other elites, they will inevitably hit the pit, along with the rest of us. the pit is this: you will have to work 2x as hard for 1/2 as much as the generation before you, and your children will have to work 2x as hard for 1/2 as much as you have now.

Lots of rainbow pedo flags, etc. I could not find a single charity that did not have some kind of DEI statement.

Doesn't surprise me that you think this way. You treat this Roman administration as your god, mortal men that take the glory of Christ for themselves. Fanatic Catholics have the name of the pope (vicarivs filii dei, "representative of the Son of God") and the Roman number of that name (666) written on your forehead (your mind). Catholicism doesn't like the bible at all, because it speaks not good of that Roman dragon church, and they killed millions of Christians to prevent the word of God being translated and available for everyone. The word of God says what it says, there is nothing you can do about that. It is not a "Protestant invention", it is preserved scripture. The teaching of grace and faith and many others that reformed Christendom is in the book. Only the scriptures were not widely available for a long time for common people, and that Roman church invented a lot of traditions, like the pharisee, and broke the scriptures. They will never repent, Rome never changes. And you can not "rewind" any of that, you would have to delete the bible, which is the wet dream of the Roman Catholic administration.

I still see retards posting this article and it's "94% of new jobs go to nonwhite people" claim
I need you to understand just how retarded the logic of the 9 people who contributed to this article was
They took these 2 facts
>In 2021, headcount at S&P 100 companies increased by 320,000
>In 2021, the amount of minorities working at S&P 100 companies increased by 300,000
and concluded
>300,000 / 320,000 ~= 94%, therefore 94% of jobs went to nonwhites
The flaw with this reasoning, the 320,000 is only the increase in HEADCOUNT, not the total number of job openings. If a white person retired in 2021, and their position was filled by a black employee, under this methodology that would count as a newly created job going to a black person when it wasn't a newly created job
A second flaw in this statistic is that it included all positions at S&P 100, which is not at all representative of the overall workforce. Walmart is in the S&P 100. This means that the hundreds of engineers and accountants working for walmart are completely overshadowed by the hundreds of thousands of cashiers, shelf stockers, and warehouse employees working for Walmart, jobs that are attractive to demographics that are uneducated or don't speak English. The statistic has no bearing on skilled work.
It took 9 people to produce this bloomberg article by the way. That's how incompetent DEI supporters are

The effort-salary ratio is generally better in a big company. Most corporations and large orgs have enough momentum/surplus cash to keep going for a good long even with a massive amount of "useless eater" positions, which already exist in the form of DEI sinecures like HR and various consultant positions.

My current job means I do basically no work and am able to draw a modest six figure salary. WFH has been a godsend since it allows me to spend my free time during work hours to do work on other skills. Currently working on improving my carpentry skills (specifically joins) + small electronic repair while saving up for some land and a better vehicle.

Agreed. The damage is done, in most cases. Middle management as well as the rank and file at most of these companies are true DEI believers, and there's no way in hell that they'll ever comply with these rulings in any real sense. It's a consequence of the ideological boot camps that universities have become, combined with the necessity of having a degree to work in large parts of the corporate west. The most fervent believers in this, degree-holding women, incl. both whites and nonwhites, have a stranglehold on areas like HR as well, which allows them to retain massive discretion over hiring to keep the diversity train rolling. Now, they'll just cloak their actions under the guise of plausible deniability while continuing to do exactly what they were doing before. And that's nothing to say as to the state of courts and judges, you trust them to actually enforce the spirit of these decisions? Only the dumbest, most flagrant violators are going to see actual consequences.

It's the same thing with the education system. It doesn't matter how many bills state legislatures pass, the schools are staffed entirely by fags and fag enablers, so of course they're going to keep promoting pro-fag ideologies to the children in their care.

Yes, but that isn't important right now. Dealing with immigration, fighting back against the institutional capture by DEI, resulting in the same neo lib policies, but just more incompetent. Dealing with the ultimate loss of autonomy from the surveillance state, and the increase in powerlessness created by the systematic atomization of every individual.

So fuck of with the fake moon landing, flat earth, pagan larp, which european is not white bullshit. You cum guzzling retard.

>Corporate America rethinking diversity hiring after conservative activists file lawsuits

> The same conservative activists who helped gut race-related college admissions at the United States Supreme Court have now set their sights on corporate diversity programs, barraging airlines, tech giants and law firms with lawsuits and complaints. And they’re already having an effect.

>The court’s landmark June ruling against affirmative action on campus didn’t cover businesses, many of which launched diversity, equity and inclusion programs after George Floyd’s 2020 murder by a white Minneapolis police officer. But as the conservative movement targets DEI, some companies have scaled back their efforts.

>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. removed race-related requirements from a similar fellowship program after a suit challenging it had been dismissed.

>America First Legal — founded by Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to former president Donald Trump – has lodged complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against more than 20 companies, including American Airlines Group Inc., Macy’s Inc., McDonald’s Corp. and Salesforce Inc., arguing that their efforts to hire and promote more women and people of colour amount to discrimination. It’s part of a broader conservative-led movement against what some Republican politicians have dubbed “woke capitalism” — corporate policies focused on topics such as diversity, climate change and worker rights.

You can't, much of the reason why these companies are going woke, besides being staffed by globohomo freaks is because they need access to cheap credit and investment money. Big money investment like Blackrock advises the Federal Reserve who has a "Money printer", they invest alot of money into pushing their DEI and Globohomo agenda by investing in these woke companies. Bottom line is we're now at the point where we can just go from A-->B. The Central banking "Money printer" apparatus is funding the entire open borders, woke, globohomo agenda. This then expresses itself as inflation and a skyrocketing national debt.

Theology-wise, yes. Of course history, archeology, anthropology etc. is also important. But "traditions"? What human traditions could ever break the word of God? This is where Catholics struggle to understand, just like the pharisee who would also have it their own way, in their own traditions, breaking the scriptures.

Catholics love pointing out the mote in in their brothers eyes, but consider not the beam that is in their own eye.
So here is the gigantic beam in your eye:
The papal dynasty is a man who claims to be the substitute for Christ on earth, and the Roman number of his name (vicarivs filii dei) comes together as 666.
People have no idea just how much filth, dirt, fornication, witchcraft, paganism, and blood in on this whores hand throughout history. It's actually incredible that there are still people who defend this pope figure. But they do, they regard this institution and the man of this institution as their god, men who take the glory of God for themselves. People follow because this man's name (representative of the Son of God) and the number of his name is on their forehead (their mind), and they take action with their right hands, and worship according to the inventions of this Roman dragon/beast.
Currently in this modern age we are around chapter 18 in the Revelation. Read it, there you will see what God has to say about this whore.

English and Social Studies are the main educational vectors for anti-whitism.
if the curriculum is fully aligned with DEI then it's nothing but anti-whitism for the whole course. Since the course is anti-whitism, it would be embarrassing to have 100% white classes being taught that they are evil and giving whites advanced college placement which would defeat the purpose of anti-whitism

Yes yes we know all about the christkike viewpoint that White people don't exist. You got that notion from the jews, which is no surprise, since you got your religion from them too. Everyone else on the planet categorizes White people as White people, and all those laws against White people which are specifically predicated upon White people existing, call White people White people. But I guess that reality doesn't parse well with your muppet brained sub-70 IQ broken headed cartoon version of the world, so now you have to do the jews' D&C for them, as per always.

What is DEI, if not explicitly anti-White policy?
What is "White privilege", and all the policies against it?

You're suggesting they've created these things to target people who don't exist. Obviously you're just retarded.

Nuclear is wonderful, clean, and efficient provided nothing goes wrong. The consequences of things going wrong are long-term disastrous. The fear of such disasters has been driven in their soft heads since early gradeschool all the way to the end of college. Lefties' fear of death and nuclear poisoning does not outweigh most of their DEI desires, and even they know Da'Quan cannot be trusted to run a nuclear reactor. Therefore, nuclear power must be forbidden. Only idiot-proof, nigger-proof, or whatever the lowest common denominator of the scum of mankind- proof things are allowed to exist for sake of equality and fairness, and perhaps even safety.

I'm half black white half white, and just had dinner with my white grandparents a couple hours ago. It honestly broke my heart how confused and scared they were about the state of this country. This is no longer their America, or even America at all.

They are really good, hard working people and the only reason I am the person I am today. My mom is a dumb ass roastoid that got knocked up by a nigger at 19 and promptly abandoned, so I grew up living at my white grandparents house and they went above and beyond to educate me and give me a good moral compass.

I won the genetic lottery and have dark features w/ green eyes, so Ive lived a privileged existence and never considered the moral and cultural erosion happening around me until COVID hit while I was in college. Something in my gut told me not to play along and refuse the vaccine, which led to me being harshly ostracized and force-fed redpills down my throat for the first time, but I held tough and told all the NPCs to suck my dick. I lost my job at the time, my qt girlfriend and 90% of my friends. It was a harsh wake up call to the reality of NPCs and the kike matrix we live in.

Fast forward to today, Im 22 with a "good" job thanks to nothing but DEI and HR roastoids salivating when they finally see me in person (Ive been sexually harassed in every job Ive ever had.) Yet all I see before me is a blown out wasteland that will only get worse and worse.

To see such good, loving humans beings like my grandparents be so emotionally distraught, to be declared the "enemy" by a criminal pedophile kike government filled me with a homicidal hatred I feel like I can barely control. This society is openly sick and evil, and its our obligation to destroy it.

Because they can intuitively pick up on the socio-professional rewards that it brings. The greatest move the left ever made was successfully making this shit mainstream in professional institutions. Every social climber in this country puts pronouns in their e-mail sig and pays lip service to DEI, not because they believe the virtues, but because it brings them that much closer to a promotion.

Honestly, we shouldn't make fun of them if they are actually trying to change their ways. This is a good video because hopefully it inspires Indians in India to stay where they are. Immigration should be ended, do not get me wrong. And videos like this one work in our favor at achieving this: Indians in India see something to be proud of and feel less ridiculed in their situation. (Don't get me wrong, frens: I was fired this year in largr part because of hitting DEI quotas. I abhor the relentless flow of scab labor that has absolutely no place here. I'm just saying that vids like what OP shared are good for us and may genuinely help Indians adopt a better culture of hygienic practice.)

>Mostly to not be murdered.
No one murders jews in the west, it is a hate crime that nets you WAY more jail time. Even US niggers know this and avoid dealing with jews. Arabs have a lot of damn good reasons to kill Jews, but they are sandniggers cut from similar cloth. Let them fight it out, preferably by themselves.

>Not being accused inanely would be a good second.
Jews are VERY good at de-personing and re-educating people for telling the truth. Jews are second to none when it comes to avoiding responsibility or accountability, and will subvert any attempt at someone doing so. Even have two major political groups to do so. Jews can't even ADMIT they are in power, despite it being objective confirmed fact. The USA president's cabinet is literally 100% Jew, you would think Democrats would be pissed at that DEI violation, but nope. Perfectly ok for some reason. And plenty of people have posted all the charts with Jews in media, corporations, etc. All of this is screaming for some DEI adjustment, yet somehow Jews avoid being associated with the 1% due to their use of identify politics.

Additional note:
Women are just as good at this but have brain biases in the human population helping them out.

>Seriously grow up: Face the consequences of your own choices.
If only Jews would adopt this advice. But that would mean personal responsibility and accountability, and we've already established this is like burning Jews alive.

Abrahamic scripture is not a historical source, just like any self-reported religious history.
Before 19th century geology, respectable science used to believe that Earth is 7k years old because it is written in the scripture. Then, it was found otherwise. Modern historiography problem is that unlike geology, is still can't let go of its own equivalent of Earth being 7k years old.

Want some actual history?
>Since the reign of Septimius Severus, sun worship had increased throughout the Empire. At the end of 220, Elagabalus instated Elagabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon, possibly on the date of the winter solstice. In his official titulature, Elagabalus was then entitled in Latin: sacerdos amplissimus dei invicti Soli Elagabali, pontifex maximus, lit.'highest priest of the unconquered god, the Sun Elgabal, supreme pontiff'. That a foreign god should be honored above Jupiter, with Elagabalus himself as chief priest, shocked many Romans.
>A lavish temple called the Elagabalium was built on the east face of the Palatine Hill to house Elagabal, who was represented by a black conical meteorite from Emesa. This was a baetylus. Herodian wrote "this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven...
>Dio writes that in order to increase his piety as high priest of Elagabal atop a new Roman pantheon, Elagabalus had himself circumcised and swore to abstain from swine.
This is the history's first ever mention of what can be connected to abrahamic religions, after culling religious texts from the list of used sources. Solar deity Elagabal (obviously Allah Baal) links pretty nice to what we call Islam, centuries before its official emergence. However, Allah Baal also links to Carthaginian solar deity Baal, and that one is well-documented to eat fried babies. As of what is mentioned about that is abrahamic scripture, that's another story, just as incriminating.

I mean, the future is bleak.

Most Gen Z/Millenials will never own a home or start a family. Pretty much will have no stake in society.

A lot of white men are realizing they can't get hired for the high paying jobs at the mega corporations because of DEI.

Women, because of above, are not really empowered like they think they are. Everything is great in their early 20's as they're affirmative action'ed into a six figure job. Until they realize they can pretty much no longer "date up" anymore since men have been pushed out of these positions. Therefore, more and more women are also growing up without kids.

More and more shitskins flood into the US and into all white neighborhoods. Not only will you not afford a home, but you will also live next to niggers that are being brainwashed to hate you everyday. So when you're old and unable to defend yourself, it's only inevitable that your face will be used as Tyrone's punching bag.

And of course, America will collapse at any point now so you will lose whatever little money you did have.

The more fascinating thing though, is that even bluepilled NPCs subconsciously know things are not looking good either.

The guy became extremly anti catholic for some reason once "padres villeros" aka catholic priests in favelas started to attack him years ago, he started to attack back against the church social doctrine and against the jesuits.

The weird thing is that some gov shills said he was an agent of the opus dei and he was open about the jesuits, seems like a internal church conflict appearing in our politics.

The jew stuff is also weird he was never talking about religion for years except maybe using the example of the fact that the templars got rekt because they had money and the state did not like them, but that's all literally.

Not sure were the jew stuff came from seems forced also.

The clergy and nobility factions also upheld civility, not just the crown whose main interest is safeguarding his realm.

Only after the monarchs were deposed and replaced with democracies and republics had the West experienced a sharp decline in prestige and quality.

Putin isn't owned by anyone. Russian society is structured in a way that there's a group of oligarchs and these oligarchs elect their representative to sit on the throne of Russia. Putin is like the capo dei capi. The oligarchs are overwhelmingly jewish and they try to push a jewish interest here and there, and the representative is supposed to sell it to the masses and convince them that it's based. Such as holocaust denial. So far it worked.

My point is that the power of the presidency is weakening and losing ideological support. The manly man Putin image of 2015 can no longer be projected without the blogger sphere satirizing it. The representative of the oligarchs needs to make more and more concessions to the Russian masses as the masses become more and more powerful. Putin is quite skilled so he knows how to maneuver this, but his heir will start from square one again, with almost no media image behind him, and the Russian society will have to transform from an oligarchy to a populist dictatorship (or face a civil war that enforces it anyway). The masses are becoming redpilled on the JQ, and the heir will have to be redpilled on the JQ, and that is why Medvedev (who is supposed to be the heir) is polishing his image and preparing it for something that the masses will love.

To sum it up: do not trust Putin, but do not become anti-Russia. The Russian people are based and will be on our side once the kike lover is gone.

Yes and no. If you think US has been pure white since the founders you're mistaken. Natives have always been interbread. South ameicans are just the bastard rape babies of Spaniards and Natives, and the south Americans aren't always brown.
There is something to keeping some ethnic purity and maintaining cultural norms. Problem is the SJW mindvirus has infected everything and made everyone retarded.
Diversity is a strength isn't a new thing. It was meant to take advantage of unique abilities and experiences to put the most qualified person in a position.
But some how this got perverted into a whacky stack of bullshit for HR checkboxes, job quality be damned. It lead to making up crap about historical oppression and an oppression Olympics to get the most preferential treatment. This is government mandated...
... also I don't believe it is a mistake. It's been known since the 90s forced Diversity and DEI type programs only foster feelings of racism where normally there wouldn't be any.
So I very much believe this forced garbage is being artificially pushed to foster people into becoming more racist...
By who? Oh no one in particular. Probably some group that thinks they are Genetically superior to everyone and needs support to commit mass genocide but are too weak to do it on their own and are seeing the subversion they have sown backfire on them.

>based black man shitting on Ivy League demons
The whole cronyism and nepotism thing in Ivy League universities is over, and it has been for a long time. Seventeen years ago my ex got into Brown while she was doing massive amounts of coke and partying her ass off, and she came from a middle class background. Several of my classmates in high school also went to Ivy League schools here in New England. They did it though hard work.

Unless you're a star football player going to a big sports school like Notre Dame, you have to maintain an excellent GPA throughout high school—and go above and beyond what's needed to graduate—in order to get into those schools. Only recently did they get rid of the nepotism/cronyism, but they swapped it out with DEI.

TLDR: Hard work in high school can get you into an Ivy League school. It has always been that way. Today it's even easier…

…unless you're white.

Was a sheriff's deputy.

My observations...

They have a place in the job. They can have superior interviewing and interrogation skills because of their appearance, demeanor, and relatability if they're smart and charismatic or able to play weak and meek depending on the subject. Anyone can write a report and some of my best partners were women simply because they would do the writing while I did the work (which was the best aspect of it IMO).

If they're Frontline responding officers they must be held to the same standards as men (however in current law enforcement all men should be held to the standards as men too instead of excusing pussification to fill a slot).

I have worked with extremely brave women who fought and went into active shooter situations. That said I have seen my share of resume padders and egotistical pussies who should never have been in it in the first place. Put simply though if you're in a dire situation the people who will actually do something will show up or try to do something and people who are cowards will either hide or not be there and it's not your problem. To expand on this a woman I "worked" with cowered and kept saying "I can't do this" when a coworker was getting shot at and her training officer brought her to the fight because he wanted to get there. He told her to pull her gun out, and she never did. She still got a pass because 'muh positions and DEI' despite him flunking her. She's now a Sgt...

To the inverse I worked with a older woman who was a Sgt and she beat me to take point on a tweaker going crazy trying to kill his girlfriend and their baby. We both shot him when he fired at us and she was cool as a cucumber.

Anon, I have worked in bullshit dead end jobs since leaving school, and last year I landed a bullshit nothing job last year and doubled my salary. My job is endless meetings that result in nothing happening, nobody does anything, I have no idea how the company is legal and its entirely propped up on basically legal money laundering.

I don't know how or why these companies are allowed to exist, and it isn't sustainable. We produce literally nothing of worth. We offer no service that fulfills a need that isn't better fulfilled by our absence.

I am convinced this is a direct result of women entering the workplace. There's a lot of women in hr style jobs, that are little more than professional meddlers and naggers. All those dei, esg and csr policies that big companies have to adhere to are made for the female mind, and thus they fill the roles to implement them. There's big money in them for some reason, and I'm convinced it's s pyramid or ponzi scheme.

The truth is it started to prop up the world order with the dollar as the reserve currency through oil. We thought we could use Israel. But it is a case of regulatory capture. The more we interacted with them, the more certain promotions are made, and then you have those promotions, promoting for their own agendas. It stopped being about US benefit a long time ago. It is the same progression that DEI initiatives have allowed to grow like cancer elsewhere, the israeli lobby has had 50 years, with much more powerful backers for it to become entrenched.

The injunction, granted Tuesday, was in response to a lawsuit against Bakersfield College and Kern Community College District leaders filed by Daymon Johnson, a history professor at the college. His suit alleged that he and other professors were penalized for espousing conservative views under the system’s mandate and discouraged from exercising their free speech rights. The lawsuit claimed the rules were unconstitutional and called for them to be suspended.
A magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California concluded that system leaders’ “aim of promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in California’s system of community colleges undoubtedly is important.” However, Johnson “has shown a likelihood of success on the merits that the regulatory scheme Defendants have put in place to advance these interests is contrary to the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech in the academic arena.”

That's not the case, the autistic frogs are useful to globohomo because they allow any opposition to globohomo to be framed as racist, sexist, or homophobic because a lot of opposition to globohomo from frogs leans on these reasons. They aren't pointing at the money in politics, they aren't talking about McKinsey or Citizens United, they are pointing at jews, women, fags, and niggers because ultimately they don't want to put in the real effort to critique and improve the system because 1) that's faggy/marxist and 2) even if those issues are addressed, the problem of white male disenfranchisement remains because ideals of social justice are tied to general economic inequality solutions. Cool, you get better health care and housing, but so do the niggers and your manager is a black woman.

Many frogs (many of whom aren't white) still live a low trust society that, for them, can only improve trust if a based racist "fascist" nationalist is in power paying lipservice through complaining about DEI and not really doing anything about it because they're against business regulations. After a while it becomes weird that the only regulations you favor only impact HR policy verbiage on a surface level. Cathartic, but ineffective. Win win between frogs and the elites.

>the rest of the country mocks you for being the highest Welfare state
>they also call you racist
I’ve watched as the rest of the country becomes just like us. 50% of workers cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment and it’s only going to get worse. I’m not sure how many jobs Guatemalans or whatever have taken from non-agricultural states, but I see plenty of Indians swooping in to snap jobs up in tech and medicine. Pretty soon a very large swath of native-born Americans won’t be able to afford to live here. And as foreigners continue to drive wages down they’ll pack up and swarm some other country like locusts. We’re probably destined for some kind of hellish UBI in the near future. And with all this DEI stuff firmly entrenched some citizens will be more equal than others.

I worked at AECOM once and quit after 2 months because I was on the verge of a mass murder suicide from working there. A gorillion dollar market cap hedge fund company (err.. "consultant") with 50k employees and maybe 20% of all of them were remotely competent or needed to do the job. Literally 5 layers of corporate bureaucracy to make 1 decision. ACTUAL HR COMISSARS AND DEI PEOPLE LIKE /POL/ WOULD TELL YOU. It was all real. The corporate culture there was a jewish hellscape run by sadists. They outsourced all their IT to pajeet retards that would take 24hrs just to connect a plotter driver to your PC which would take me 3 seconds. Their corporate comms would send you emails about how quarterly profits were record high while they paid you like shit. The only people left working at companies like that are linkedin fags who worship their corporate employers and try to suck you in to their shitty existence.

I moved on to a small firm of 25 people and never been happier, make 35% more, and actually like my colleagues and it's actually worth going to work.

OpenAI is jewish run, jew got kicked out, other jews pressured OpenAI to reinstate the jew

This is what jews always do. However the people making the actual accomplishments aren't jewish. The only thing jews can do is take over what's already successful and then run it into the ground. The competent people leave for better companies and gradually learn that working for or with jews is a big mistake.

That's when you start to get non-jewish companies, which must be forced to hire jews through DEI initiatives.

If non-jewish companies persist in their success and continue to lack jewish leadership, then jewish lawmakers and regulators start raking the company and owners over the coals trying to find any dirt or excuse to destroy it wholesale. Especially if that company is a competitor to existing jewish monopolies.

This is how the market actually works in the west. Jews are in an ongoing process of taking control of all business or destroying any business they haven't taken control of.

Historically speaking ethnic/religious monocultures are the strongest of all societies.

Diversity leads to weakness, distrust, and a lack of cohesion, lack of national identity as well as civil war due to power struggles between the factions.

Even the communists know this.

Even you Jews understand this, which is why you established Israel and are attempting an ethnic cleansing.

DEI is just a way to weaken and destroy nations.

“Jobs” in the modern economy are entirely superfluous. We haven’t had a true need for mass employment for over 100 years thanks to mechanized farming and automation. Instead, the real purpose of modern work is to keep you exhausted, distracted, and, most importantly, exposed to corporate social engineering (ESG, DEI, LGBT, etc.) that you would never tolerate without the threat of financial ruin. In fact, most products on the shelf are grossly overpriced and/or kept artificially scarce to better reinforce the power of financial incentives.

Amen, this is true.

I’ve seen it in the corporate structure for years but it’s reached really bad levels lately. My company also has stopped hiring white men because of DEI initiatives, enraging to see it. You know, even though 35 out of 40 of our applicants are white men given this is programming in the mid west for Pete’s sake. Our society hates us, our government actively works against our interests, and women have become spoiled entitled brats who have been brainwashed into hating the role they are literally adapted for by nature.

For every woman who’s a productive power house keeping up with or outstripping the men there are 4 more who basically do nothing while making a fat salary in some bullshit middle management, HR, or excel type job.

Straight up if I were a black woman I would have the keys to the kingdom in terms of trivially landing some bullshit exec job because hiring is not tied to merit anymore.

/pol/ has more or less the same theories that evolutionary psychologists have regarding female mate choice, but uses different language. in anthropology and ev.psych you'll find the exact same stuff.
bodyguard hypothesis is that the female secures a male who displays violent charachteristics because it means he will be able to protect offspring. also feeds into beta bux aplha fucks as in securing resources and superior genetic material. there are many competing theories about this, just ask chatgpt. it's actually wild how academia has this veneer of DEI but /pol/ seriously near-peer in this discipline without any grants or surveys.

Israelites descent from Hebrews. And they are not Edomite Judaean pharisee, and also not the multitude "Jews" that blaspheme Christ today.
Israelites are White people. The northern kingdom of Israel was divorced from God and scattered into Europe as Scythians, Lombards, Goths, Saxons, etc. later called "Germani" by the Roman Emperor, the Germanic peoples. The scattered lost tribes of Israel who lost their name. Where did they come from? Did they just magically appear on the world stage from "nowhere"? grew out of the soil of Europe to take over the whole show randomly? Of course not, they went into Europe. Highly cultured and capable people who though seemed to have lost something, as if they lost their civilization. But God knows His people, and where they are, and He used them to crush that Roman Empire, the dragon. You know where the double headed eagle of the HRE of the German nation comes from? Assyria, the land of the Asen, Aesir. The land where the scattered "lost" Israelites were in "captivity". Well, 2+2=4.
And that verse of scripture is already fulfilled long time ago. It talks about the sealed 144k when the pagan Roman Empire was utterly destroyed. So that there wouldn't be total chaos and disorder. The fall of pagan Rome was a big deal, a major event. The "sun" (symbolic for the Emperor or ruling power) became black, and the moon as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth. Heaven = governmental powers, earth = social environment.
Revelation is history, not some Roman Catholic counter-reformation scheme and eternal speculation into the future. Speculating where the magical number 666 appears this time, mmh is it the barcode or some Wall Street number...? It's just talking about the papal dynasty, the man who claims to be the substitute for Christ on earth, and the number of his name (vicarivs filii dei) comes together as 666.
God's word is true and His prophecy is fulfilled throughout all of Christian history in the last 2000 years.

The current administration is intentionally leaving the southern border open to violent cartels, terrorist cells, and hostile foreign nations so that in the future it can weaponize the intelligence agencies against its own citizens for their "safety". Citizens will not allow this to happen unless the federal government manufactures a crisis to happen. It's just the next step in creating a police state like China. The DEI struggle sessions and totalitarian Nikki Haley social media laws will continue until eventually we end up with pic related.

The templars and other orders like opus dei and holy roman empire (not the vatican and still exists but in hiding) had a lot of power at the time and some 'illuminated renascentists' wanted to have a piece of the cake too, so they made their special secret club and they are the run of the mill masons. That place was fought and controlled by Christians and Muslims at some point in time, so its kinda a kitchen sink of symbolism there but it belongs to the masons.
They are part of the 2 major politic parties in the country and try to advance their goals thru policies and the multiple companies they share ownership.
Most Christians groups still try to influence things but in the grand scheme of things they have an hands off approach because they truly believe that its not in anyone hands and God will sort it out in the end.

You brought multiculturalism to Europe, deal with it mein kikel.

You had the entire right wing against mudslimes for 20 years but you wanted to keep flooding Europe with mudslimes. Now you have Mudslime like Hasan Piker riling up zoomers against Jews. You've enervated and deplatformed the right while simultaneously invigorated the left.

>What do I do pol?
I guess you'll have to learn to do what white men have been doing the last 20 years due to the kikery, DEI, hiring practices, immigration policies you guys pulled. Keeping their mouths shut and not saying anything politically incorrect in the workplace or in college or any social platform. Good job falling on your own sword.

Men are just more 'extreme' than women. Women just gravitate towards the middle. They take safe jobs and safe careers. Right now it just looks more lopsided because most high paying management/director positions are so easy even niggers can do them. So women are handed these due to DEI quotas.

Men have equally a greater chance of becoming drug addicts or becoming successful entrepreneurs and self made millionaires. It's just the government is making it much more difficult for the latter to happen for men.

Blackstone is the money side of the business, taking in government slush funding and turning it into leveraged buyouts of failing businesses as a kickback/bailout of corporate lobbyists. Blackrock is the partner venture they direct using DEI policies and private depositor money, since not even the government cant afford to buy every toxic asset on the market and this way the minorities pay for it too instead of just the taxpayer.

>Ma io la guerra avrei potuto vincerla ugualmente se fossi stato meno sensibile al rispetto umano. Se fossi stato un dittatore come amavano definirmi gli ignobili pennaioli stranieri, anime perdute nelle mani dei falsari della storia, e come spesso mi rimproveravo di non essere, avrei obbligato Marconi, magari con la tortura, a consegnarmi la sua scoperta, la più grande di questo secolo. Quando io ho detto al mondo che se l’Italia fosse stata costretta a prendere le armi avrebbe sorpreso per il suo genio inventivo, non bluffavo. Io non ho mai bluffato. Ho alzato spesso la posta, ma mai ho puntato alla cieca sulla carta della fortuna. Là dove non avevo la forza avevo la certezza politica…

>A cose fatte un ambasciatore mi disse che avevo sfidato l’Inghilterra con un due di bastoni. Lo stesso ambasciatore, dopo il discorso delle ‘armi strabilianti’, andò da Ciano a dire che se avessi posseduto realmente quelle armi mi sarei ben guardato bene dal farlo sapere. Invece io lo dicevo per frenare gli stimoli alla guerra, di questa stramaledetta guerra, che io sentivo avvicinarsi col passo felpato dei criminali.

>Se quel diplomatico fosse stato con me ad assistere agli esperimenti di Marconi sarebbe rimasto di sasso. Sulla strada di Ostia, ad Acilia, Marconi ha fermato i motori delle automobili, delle motociclette e dei camion. Nessuno sembrava rendersi conto dell’improvviso guasto e poterono ripartire soltanto quando lo volle il grande inventore. L’esperimento venne ripetuto sulla strada di Anzio, con i medesimi risultati. Ad Orbetello, due apparecchi radiocomandati vennero incendiati a oltre duemila metri di altezza. Marconi aveva scoperto il ‘raggio della morte’ e lo aveva perfezionato in modo da poterlo usare con discreta facilità e con una spesa relativamente modesta.

Western Jews are in a really nasty spot. After years of Jews of privilege demonizing white people, robbing them of merit-based wealth via programs like DEI, advocating for mass immigration to the point of population replacement (i.e., genocide), and ENCOURAGING minorities to hate the mere sight of white skin…. Well, I guess it never occurred to them how white they looked. Never occurred to them how actually privileged they were, with their positions of wealth and power. So now as the Jew turns to the white man to cry about how poorly he is being treated, how unfair this discrimination is, the white man shrugs and says, “Sucks, doesn’t it? Welcome to 2023.”

The terminology for axis was a pivot of power. That is what is currently being attempted by the WEF. To pivot away from US hegemony into BRICs nations. It has all been laid out previously. If the US doesn't secure its borders and backtrack DEI, then the plan will work flawlessly. They do need more Caucasian deaths at this point though.

Remember the BRICs alliance started the troonwave. Regardless of the propaganda, this new (((normal))) is here to stay no matter what side you choose. China can't pretend to push for whites and neither can the Russians. Both sides are explicitly globohomo. They are all just competing to see gets to be the shabboest of goys.

The real problem is that our governing apparatus is so corrupt and inefficient that a fraction of that billions ever actually ends up being spent on trains and airports abs stuff you can see. So many middle men fleecing the cost and taking their cut.

My entire point is that in their present state, there is nothing you can do to keep them from growing.
In the course of my work, do you know what I se unfolding in America?
These organizations growing. ESG and DEI initiatives have made it exceedingly difficult for white men under 25 to find employment in the private sector.
Large companies all kneel at the feet of Blackrock, and small and medium companies don't hire at the entry level.
Obviously it's limited to my personal experience but I have spoken to an outsized number of them who, given lack of better options, have taken up working at the FBI and the IRS. In the Federal Court system.
As government employees.
They are cornered out of having better options, so they go to work for the very thing that hates them most.
Because government employment rewards obedience and disincentivizes critical thinking, they're not developing real transferable skills.
And because of these orgs' non-meritocratic structure, these men are stuck in stand-still and even dead-end careers, and they're not advancing through the rank structure to positions of authority.
People from a starkly different demographic are.

I know plenty of X and boomers that don't advertise DEI is total bullshit, but they purposely surround themselves with problem solvers rather than problems with megaphones, and so the consolidate power and skill. It's a rising tide. Pay down and avoid debt, then get your money in things that increase in value. Land or CDs or houses, not cars and iPhones. It is a long road but the strategy wins. Then you have 'fuck you' money, and can lead the next generation of problem solvers.

This is wholly, if not more than wholly offset by the fact that DEI directly advocates for me needing to be better than everyone else already. If I am equal to another race or gender, I am literally unhireable, as I cannot be chosen before a LBBBQQTpi or NIGGRO competitor. So the system already runs off the ruleset that employing me requires me to already be superior choice. And the rules seem to get harsher every few years. Extra bonus referral money if they are a minority, special women's or colored's leadership programs, some of the ridiculous lip service I've heard for leftist causes du jour. The very environment in many workplaces is bubblewrapped and made to accommodate females better.
If you keep noticing trends, then it is usually foolish to believe the trends will magically stop or reverse. I'll wait till I start seeing the pendulum swing back the other quite a bit before I start giving a shit about women again.

my point isn't whether or not the US could wipe out the cartels, or whether or not there's traitorous government officials and jews infesting the ranks of ALL our governments.

I live in Texas, my ancestors were amongst the first to settle this land in 1800's after the defeat of the Mexicans. Many whites believe that this is the white man's land, they are wrong, only the North and East of San Antonio and North of Houston is. Everything below that is hispanic controlled. That being said, I have categorized every type of creature you will see here. This place is a fucking zoo.
Hispanics:
>The short (dark) brown mutt; characterized by his extremely small stature, collared t-shirts, and male pattern baldness. Likes drinking too much and talks on the phone in broken Spanish while on the toilet, in a public restroom. They always look busy despite not having a job. The women work as maids. The children fail 7th grade math. Peak nigger tier apart from the criminal element.
>The mestizo; usually taller than the native South American SBM (5'6"), but visibly a random admixture of several different races. They can look like Jews. They are the most common form of hispanic. Can hold certain types of work, but nothing that requires extensive mental faculties. Slightly smarter and better than the SBM. Some can work in higher fields, but it is a rarity. They are all fat or on their way to being fat. Can be nigger tier. Still not white.
>The white passing hispanic; a rarity but they still exist. They think, talk and act like a white person. Still brown, but not anywhere near nigger tier. Looks uncanny to the white southerner who only lives with blue and green eyed people. Slightly insane, so probably best to stay away. Can be fat, but not likely.
Blacks:
>Urban nigger; smokes weed, hates whitey and fucks mestizos because black women need that welfare check. It's the same everywhere.
>Country nigger; loves whitey, wants to date white girls (the ones with fathers deny him). Supports Trump.
>Mixed; votes democrat, hates whites and looks like every Klaus Schuab DEI ad. Will claim they don’t care about race when they side with Floyd.

Same time period for me. I heard that phrase but nobody was doing 15 on 1 and beating niggers to death. The rhyme meant keep it fair and break it up if gets out of hand. This wasn't that long after integration, so most fights were white vs. white, black vs. black. Everybody stayed in their lane, for the most part.

The town I grew up in was around 65% black, because it was literally a cotton mill town. That said, schools were more neighborhood-based. Elementary school was probably 90% white, then we had to go to the closest city for middle and high school. Those were 50% white.

Interracial stuff was kept to an absolute minimum. If something like this happened the parents of those 15 kids would all get a visit. Dating between races was looked down upon by whites AND blacks.

This line has been blurred increasingly since 2006ish. Mass censorship, banning people, state media messaging, Hollywood, academics, you name it pushing Marxism openly because they are using division to suck the life out of us.

Same time period. 99% of my white AND black acquaintances had both parents and a house. It might have been a cracker box but they owned it. Integration = failed experiment like social justice, DEI, ESG, etc.

If you don't care what is true your society is going to be destroyed by following fake religions.
You can't build a civilization by believing fundamentally fake or illusory things. It always leads to disaster.

I don't like intellectualism, but there's a difference between fart sniffing faggots in academia writing paper after paper coping about some subject and understanding philosophy, truth, and divine order.

You're confusing rote knowledge and discursive reasoning for wisdom and absolute truth. The latter two are crucial for any successful white civilization. It's precisely because jew religions lack those that they've had such disastrous results long term.

Mormons promote dei liberal shit now, they are not what they used to be. And they believe in absurd jewish fairy tales and conman stories.

Something to consider, if you have autism, is that the whole system is not made for us and indeed is hostile to us. Normies are already faced with employment being impossible, now add autism and it's a no win situation with few exceptions. AutismBux has little/no shame depending on where one is at with bullshit skills like "masking" without which you are a pariah and the sensory issues of low skill employment makes it impossible for many autists.

I've considered doubling down on being a total freak and larping as a troon for the DEI bonus points so I too can make $200k sitting on my ass at home with my CS degree. Playing up being a "good autist". That's with a fucking degree that's ostensibly good for something. It's absurd so take what you can get if you can.

ofcourse, they made up 'white' to shit on europeans, it's a fraud label entirely. To falsely equate european subraces with eachother, and also relativize their existence, and trying to claim it's about pigmentation which it isn't, you can't even subdivide european races on pigmentation.
Then they put every other race on planet into 'brown' or 'poc'.
Then they realize ofcourse. That since jews have light pigmentation. And they tell every dumb motherfucker to focus only on pigmentation. That they're going to start calling jews 'white supremacists' aswell. And so they aren't going to be able to use DEI to nepotistically hire nothing but jews in top positions with excuse of being 'minority' or 'brown'. So they have to change from team 'white' to team 'PoC' which are both completely fake.
How about we just call them team jew, and we call europeans team europe, and you know call the races what they actually are. Now no more games can be played ofcourse. No more fake 'PoC' solidarity either between totally different races who larp as identical because of they have darker pigmentation.

there's no white or brown people it's fraud labels.

Because if jews don't remove themselves from this fraud 'white' label it would mean that israel needs to be eradicated and diversified by the brown supremacists of mixing everyone with the darkest pigmented people possible to produce mystery meat hybrids that USA is all about now.

Atheists are a million times more pozzed though because atheism was spread in the early 2000's to create a vacuum to indoctrinate people into this DEI nonsense further be having it be the only basis for belief. Also why Out of Africa and evolution are taught in schools; it normalizes browning and nigger behavior. .

Reminder that MLK doesn't even believe that Jesus is divine, despite claiming to be "baptist". He's antitrinitarian yet nobody talks about this. MLK was a psyop to make Christians okay with the concepts of multiculturalism and future DEI nonsense that the 60's laid the ground work for, where Christians in America previously were some of the most explicitly racist, beating up Irish and Italian immigrants for being Papists in a largely Protestant country and the Klansmen were started by Baptists.

Jews will successfully pivot to being people of color to save DEI afterwards but make no mistake, all that matters in this world is whether they view someone as being white, the truth has never mattered. I’ve lost interest precisely because I realized either way whites will be blamed

I think more of an effort needs to be made to provide tacit support to the out of control golems (providing information to awaken the masses etc, steering talking points etc). They need to be coaxed into more brash actions (which alienate them to the native populations) and then once proof is secured, reported to the police/Zionist doxxers, which is a win win as it frees up their DEI secured jobs and also creates even more resentment due to it demonstrating that the tribe does truly lord over them, completely invalidating the “conspiracy theory” cope spewed by our overlords. This is one way to leverage the current social momentum we have while staying out of it and watching from the sidelines, I see no reason to get involved otherwise.

White Canadians and Americans want to see the places their ancestors left. That's why tourism is so popular amongst White people. Once you've been there, there's no point in returning for a second visit, imo. I'm so many different European ethnicities mixed together it's pointless to say I'm of "xyz" ancestry. I've been to every country and city my most recent ancestors migrated from...and even in modern times I can see why they left. My Grandmother is Italian, isn't even an American citizen, and still cries about dying in her childhood home. She decided to sell it. She's the reason she can't go back. Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi is a shit hole. I'm happy I only went there once and will never return.

That's not what you said, you said:
>>women aren't people
And I disagree with this because I think that women (despite their foolishness when not under the guidance of good men) are still made in God's image - I believe Imago Dei is legitimate (incidentally I also believe this is why demons resent us so much and want us to forget this -- we have what they don't).

I’m insanely white my guy, it’s why I’m not here supporting an ethnic cleansing of Jews in retribution for a colonial mistake.
My ancestor was Tom Quick the Indian Slayer, look him up.

I do not believe there is a viable outcome where Israel “surrenders” at all, even if they should. I know former FARC members from Colombia, and the only way forward is to give these people a seat at your table. There is no outcome where Hamas “surrenders” either, in that case. These people will always try to kill you, and you can’t just “nits make lice” like you’re fucking boers and expect to fit in a DEI economy anymore.

I honestly believe if more kikes paid attention to some of the anons on this board they’d make some gains.

If IDF chicks are actually racking kills that’s respectable, but I am not seeing any infantry whatsoever, so I’m wondering if they’re in the Merkava’s with a bunch of dudes losing their shit and degrading process of engagement between operators.

This tweet is retarded. Kikes were never against the DEI enterprise. They always intended to be considered a non-white class. The only reason any of them are even considering opposing it is that their golems view kikes as white.

Making an "official" effort to "save" DEI by labelling Jews as non-white to appeal to Jews is retarded. Jews were already bought in. The only thing they could possibly be doing is trying to make a last ditch effort to convince the slaves that Jews are a protected DEI class.

get hired into fintech, boss slowly expanding team of 5 people to 10 people, female senior director says there needs to be more spans and layers, no more than 5 direct reports per person, creates 2 new manager positions in one extra span, both women, no experience in fintech or stats or analytics.

boss gets sick, goes on medical leave eventually departing company, one of 2 new female new diversity hire managers appointed as director without position posting or interview process in violation of company policy.

senior director tells newly appointed diversity hire female director that the team needs to expand. Diversity hire director doesn't understand our business, doesn't understand job requirements for position, ignores input and advice of senior team members on needed skill sets, berates existing employees because team is getting in trouble with recruiting team for failing interviews for too many candidates, remove existing team members from hiring process grows team to over 40 people in 6 months. new employees do not have job experience in tech or finance, do not have necessary skills, DEI checklist garbage, untalented. extreme productivity and work quality difference between original 10 and new 30

newly mega team now needs 6 new managers and one more span because senior director spans and layers, encourages internal candidates to apply, ignore all of the internal male candidates, promote 3 internal female candidates hire 3 cucked untalented spineless male managers to bully

over the course of the next year it's clear new talent isn't capable of doing job, breaking code, violating regulations and laws through ignorance, making up shit to get raises and promotions

anon and fellow original white male team members are targeted for removal and anon is ultimately let go. team limps along for 2 months and then every person is called into a meeting and summarily fired, business needs have grown beyond capabilities of remaining team

If you'll join me in replacing the yarmulke with a tinfoil hat for a moment, here's a theory: build up low-IQ mob-level organization with limited capacity for impulse control and ability to think in larger chunks of time, use them to keep everyone focused on a localized conflict with similarly low-level moblins on the other side of the world, push the cost-of-living crisis and inflation strangely benefiting only one specific group to the back page, keep the spergs and melaninfrens focused on a foreign issue they really can't do anything about?

Or is that too smoothbrained

Yes, General Mola was supposed to take charge and was the first leader, but got killed in an airplane accident... And Franco was the most victorious one so they handed the leadership to him and finished the war. He was ultra catholic so he went more with the church and the opus dei instead of falangists, that ended with just the ministry of labor and the FC Barcelona.

Civil War ended with the national side winning and kicking all the commies away, and Franco took power because he was the most relevant general after General Mola died in a plan crash. He instaurated a dictatorship, and with the course of time he went off the WW II, He sided with USA against the commies and his goverment was less falangist and more opus dei conservative in the meantime making Spain at the 60s-70s an incredible economic growth. Then Franco put Juan Carlos I as his heir in terms of Monarchy and died. Juan Carlos decided that wil be a constitutional monarchy in democracy and things were moved to make eveybody happy, then socialists took power and corrupted everything.

I'll tell you the times the socialists took in power:
>Alfonso XIII runs away from Spain in fear of getting ACKED as the Romanov in Russia
>Socialists chea the Elections of the III Republic, aftewards Civil War happend
>Militars and Guardia Civil fake a coup d'etat against conservative goverment, Adolfo Suarez already resigned one day before because he knew was happening: The coup was aimed with Juan Carlos and the PSOE to push a socialist goverment in next elections, the coup was never meant to success for the military but for the PSOE
>Terrorist attacks in 11 March of 2004, aimed by a mix of different elements involved which i can't say or will get -acked, 2 days before national elections, turning the vote and making the people vote against the actual goverment, making Zapatero win the elections (Just connect dots)
>PSOE allies with terrorist, basque & catalonian independentits and commies to take over the goverment with a motion of censure against the cuckservative Rajoy, who instead of making new elections, decided to make it go forward, putting Perro as president and making what i commented before about taking over the company who recounts spanish national elections votes (INDRA) and meeting with Soros.

Conclusion: The left, is always the left.

Bullshit. Once things stop working, people will start learning again. It's a supply/demand cycle.

Although I detest marijuana and think that nobody should ever take it, I am in favor if it being legal, like many bad decisions are legal.

I don't like marijuana, I voted against it, as my right as a voter. I know it is a losing issue, I've seen the writing on the wall back in 2008. There are some benefits that marijuana legalization could provide to citizens with acute or chronic pain complaints, or perhaps enabling safer recreational consumption through its sale. However, chronic marijuana use leads to suboptimal functioning, decreased personal awareness, and lowered community participation. Conservative (not Republican) factions should speak up about these issues, they should even pursue legislative options to protect their communities, even if the libertarian view ends up prevailing. These issues are important. Compromising (the Republican way) hasn't conserved anything. And tantrums work, look at Issue 1. It would be nice to see the GOP have a platform, something with clearly defined goals and a plan to achieve them that isn't simply 'use activist judges,' 'exploit rural district majorities,' or 'oppose everything in the enemy playbook.' But until they do, evangelicals are the ones with the boots on the ground stumping to get people to the polls.

Strictly speaking we are still in the Reformation. It didn't went far enough and got subverted by Roman counter-reformation schemes that 99% of Christians believe nowadays. Protestants are apostate today, and they know very little about what the Reformation fathers knew and understood well. Today they don't know that the whore of Babylon is the papal system and its synagogue of satan, the beast on which this whore rides is the body politics of the western nations, and the pope is a man who literally claims to be the substitute for Christ, and the number of his name (vicarivs filii dei) is 666.
The new Reformation will be the Christian Identity message. Because that is the very plot of the book. Christ and His people, and all of the Revelation of Jesus Christ takes place among that very people; Europe and the European peoples of the world. The bible doesn't care about Chinese or Indians or Africans. It only cares about God's people, Israel. That is who we are, literally, physically, not just spiritually. We are the people from the book, the seed of the promise through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And indeed we are blessed above all families of the earth thanks to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then we blessed all the other families of the earth with infrastructure, technology, medicine, rule of law, Christians morals, with all of Christian civilization. As prophesied. 2+2=4
We are the woman with the twelves stars that is addressed here:
>James 1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
And the bide needs to prepare herself for the wedding.

No it didn't. We are in it right now, and every Christian has been in the Revelation of Jesus Christ in their respective time, doing all they could to prepare the kingdom, as we must. The bride must prepare herself.
The time is at hand for all Christians throughout all of Christian history, because it is His_story. And He will return right here to this physical earth and reign, literally, in His physical form. We won't sit on some clouds, the kingdom is already, and it grew throughout millennia, and we are the lively stones of the kingdom. Only right now we still have that Roman dragon in our neck, and its synagogue of satan, and the pope who literally claims to be the substitute for Christ. A man, and the number of his name (vicarivs filii dei) comes together as 666. All that evil will not exist in the coming kingdom of Christ.

Abortion murders babies, damages mothers and creates a society that views human life as disposable.

Losing wars tends not to inspire up and coming young men to serve. The DEI/ESG tier ads didn't help either isolated lot of White rural dudes that would have joined and seems the trying to get simps to join was mostly a failure judging by current recruitment numbers.

Seems most Zoomers genuinely don't have a interest in the military.

There's the FSSP, they're under John Paul II's motu proprio 'Ecclesia Dei'.

They're great and a lot of them also leave the fraternity when they get the opportunity to serve in a standard parish if they have the Bishop's permission to celebrate the traditional tridentine mass. A lot of bishops are a bit afraid of the Vatican in this regard since Francis' war on traditional parishes and his ironically named 'traditionis custodes', so they're getting strong again. I believe their US stronghold is Denver.

Full tradition, full communion, not schizo like SSPX sometimes.

A race-blind and truly meritocratic system, perhaps one where employers were permitted to use IQ tests to select employees and the like, would be de-facto white supremacy - and provided these criteria were maintained, it would remain so. I recall a Twitter thread from some guy who worked in DEI (not an ideologue - his specialty was in figuring out how to keep the civil-rights niggerfaggots away by choosing the right selection of token execuniggers without lobotomizing the company) who told an interesting story - some new negress was convinced whitey was putting his thumb on the scales (she was right, but not in the way she thought) and insisted that the criteria for selecting executives be much more objective, with much more emphasis on things that amounted to IQ tests rather than subjective "personal-statement" horseshit. The result was that this new process - everyone except this negress knew what would happen - selected no niggers, which was apparently a great embarrassment - they had to cover it up/explain it away somehow, since it would have looked very bad and caused genuine problems otherwise.

That was before drones like the Lancet became wildly popular on the modern battlefield, LGBTQ and DEI hires won't be able to invent countermeasures for Lancets and drone swarms so even Iran could sodomize the US military in most scenarios if they are willing to pay the price in blood.

Better phone cameras, and... that's about it? haha. Graphics are a bit better, but it doesn't matter because games and other applications suck or feel slower.

Computers are exponentially faster, yet interfaces are slower and laggier than they were 20 years ago lol because programmers and systems designers are exponentially dumber. Not to mention that (here's some pol stuff!) companies need to meet DEI/ESG metrics so most UI/UX is handled by women, minorities, and outsourced poojeets in Hyderabad.

>You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away.

Niggers only care about other niggers. That's why you shouldn't care about them. Stop helping them. Stop acknowledging they even exist. If you have to work with them, quit. Companies will only wake up from the dei nightmare once they're sufficiently diverse enough for the dei loans not to offset the costs. I think we're already pretty close to that.

Niggers are so dumb they didn't even invent the wheel. Ever. Every time white people had to show them. Many African tribes don't even understand fire.

They're not equals. Neither is Obama. He's the world's first a foremost recipient of affirmative action. Without which he'd be cleaning toilets for white people.

America's talent well has run dry; as standards erode, institutional inertia can only carry us so far. What happens when the last generation of competent and capable workers/inventors/leaders retires? What happens when people who graduated high school in a pic related environment are put in charge of training the next generation of Americans who also graduated from said environment? We are on the edge of the toilet bowl, but the only solution that could keep us from falling in are simply unpalatable to the majority of Americans, including the ones who would benefit the most from saving our system.
This scenario is playing out in the airlines right now. It's not just DEI hires either (though they certainly suck), even whytbois are getting hired at major U.S. airlines when just a few years ago they would have been told to fuck off. Pretty soon you will have Captains with less experience than a regional first officer from 10 years ago, and they will be in charge of an even less experienced retard. What ill omens are anons noticing in their daily lives?

This school basically overlaps heavily with what’s variously been called “political correctness,” “social justice,” the concept of intersectionality (where everyone is split up into race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, etc., and placed on a scale of “oppressor” vs. “oppressed), as well as the DEI and ESG initiatives of the West. (Swap out “bourgeois” for “Christian conservative White heterosexual cisgender males” and “proletariat” for anyone who doesn’t fully fit into that class, now posit a revolution of that new “proletariat” — women’s rights, black rights, Muslim justice, transgender acceptance and the LGBTQ movement, etc.)

So where classical Marxism had a dictatorship of the proletariat, class conflict and workers’ revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie etc., the “neo-Marxism” has a feminist struggle, black struggle, LGBTQ struggle, etc., where these poor oppressed peoples rise up against white men, against “white supremacy”/“patriarchy”/“homophobia”/“transphobia”/“cisheteronormativity”/“muh racism”/“muh sexism” etc. And, ironically, the huge, massively wealthy corporations, also significantly owned-through-investments by groups like BlackRock and Vanguard and also urged by Larry-Fink-owned BlackRock’s ESG scores, adhere to such “social justice” views of “being an iconoclastic revolutionary who definitely is NOT just unthinkingly getting fucked in the ass by mainstream media, corporations, government and the education system to believe in what they believe in, making an ahegao face and being Stockholm-Syndrome’d into totally loving and agreeing with their anal-rapists :^)”

If you are white corporations literally don't hire you because you're not diverse enough. This is the dystopia these cocksuckers have created. Either you got in before this shit started or it's an uphill battle everytime because they'll choose the "diverse" candidate over you barring knowing the owner personally or some shit. It is genuinely insane how bad this crap has gotten.

Asians have it almost as bad as we do (worse in the university situation) and this exact situation is why there have been so many University lawsuits and legal disputes recently. Corporations have been doing the exact same thing though in terms of reverse discrimination. Honestly this is disgusting and should be fucking illegal. Blackrock Larry Fink and ESG cunts can drown in the ocean for all I care, they're actively ruining my life with their bullshit. This is also why art has completely gone to shit because these woke cunts get hired and then hire more of themselves and people aren't actually hired based on being the best candidate anymore.

Fuck the US we don't have a proper healthcare system even though every other fucking western country in the world does, we waste unfathomable amounts of money on retarded shit that doesn't matter and is probably just money laundering at this point, you can't get any decent corporate job if you're white and especially a white man because of "affirmative action DEI" shit, housing is fucked, inflation is fucked, government debt is fucked, wages are fucked.

We're going through a fucking dark age and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. And I hate California and hope it falls off into the sea - the damage their warped ideology has done that they've pushed onto everyone else via social media giants is incalcuable. The "decision makers" should face consequences for ruining society but they won't.

You're right but the solutions that have been proposed are systemic in nature and at first glance do not look directly related to relations between the sexes. Take homeownership for young people for instance. Or removing DEI, or promoting/giving quotas to women in higher education. It's all related. If /pol/ made a political program sexual relations wouldn't be a big chapter, most political propositions in it would make propositions for sexual relations superfluous.

In theory, there are a few ways you can undercut traditional brick and mortar universities. Going online like Peterson is doing is a no brainer, since it means you don't have to hire janitorial staff or other maintenance for physical property. You also don't need to buy property to put the campus on in the first place. He wouldn't be the first to do an online university, although most online universities *are* scams. After that, the next way to save money would be to cut administrative costs. Universities do actually spend too damn much on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and even non-DEI administrative positions are paying way too damn much. No position at a university should ever pay more than a full professor, because no administrator is working harder than the guy that has to manage research, lecturing, AND service to the university in committee positions. I've seen how hard these people work, and anyone being paid more than them needs a pay cut.

Next, you could probably cut research. If you're only doing bachelor's degree programs, you don't necessarily need your professors doing anything other than teaching and grading papers. Granted, this means less opportunities for undergrads to get a taste of whether they should be considering grad school, but hey... if all we care about is whether students meet a particular set of educational standards, you could make your university just "high school, but actually challenging". After that though... I don't know. You're pretty much a degree mill at this point.

TLDR: In some rural NC town, principle Dindu dindun think it was fair that some future doctors received failing grades in their high school classes, so said principle altered their grades. Of course, those future scientists and presidents also happened to play on the school's state champion foolsball team. Go figure.

The corruption is very widespread. They destroyed Watson because he stated a simple foundational truth about genetics, that genes determine a person's attributes. If we cannot admit that is true, we might as well close down biology research. The main research organization in the USA, the NIH, the largest health research funder in the world, is extremely pozzed right now too. They are obsessed with promoting the DEI race diversity agenda, gay/lesbian/tranny stuff, and they refuse to hire almost any USA born white males at all anymore. Most positions are stuffed to the max with radical females and incompetent browns. So it is no surprise that most research results are all wrong lately and pharmaceutical companies can just tell modern scientists what to do for a few threats or payouts.

Yes. In a nutshell, the companies pledged to meet "diversity" requirements (hiring a certain percentage of women and "minorities") and they would get access to the fund. Whether that meant low interest loans or straight up cash infusions is anyone's guess, and might've been on case-by-case basis.
Later other clauses were added that mandated that the actual products also meet these guidelines. It was promptly shut down as soon as people started asking too many questions about the whole thing.

Most of the people getting shit canned are useless middle management and 'soft skills' retards that only got the job to up the company's DEI numbers. Now that the percentages of minorities doesn't matter as much as bottom line, employees are being assessed on their ability to generate revenue, or support those that are generating revenue.

Mundus a materia captus est,
Animae nostrae ad chaos merguntur.

Via ad caelos oblitus est,
Arcanum sacrumque decrescit.

Terram pro tabula tradidimus,
Veritas in umbris latet.

In conscientia, veritas renascitur,
Mens Divina omnia imperat.

Morte obversi,
Ad Mentem Divinam ascendimus.

Per lucem doloris,
Sapientia per universum diffunditur.

In somno Dei resonante ambulamus,
Ultra mundum tangibile, animae nostrae diriguntur.

Kyrie, Kyrie, fons veritatis,
Kyrie, lux caelestis, eleison.

O sacra, O serena,
O pura, O suavis visio veritatis apparet.
O sacra, O serena, O pura, O suavis,
O lilium puritatis.

>disappearing funding systems
What does this mean? I don't think Patreon or Kickstarter shut down, right? Is this a direct reference to DEI slush finds?

Yeah agreed. The pay could be shit if the job was rewarding and you gave young men an adventure and a hero's status coming home. And if they had a functioning society where they had women waiting for them, functioning families, jobs, fun, something to actually protect. But even materially well-off young men generally don't, I don't think. I think I'd be more concerned about my property in USA being destroyed or looted or doled out while I'm off fighting than the threat from the outside, because of the social situation here, if I was one of those men. And if I wasn't, I don't think I could come up with a compelling reason. There's nothing to unify the nation anymore because it seems to have ceased to be a nation, and therefore these men that need to be drawn on don't have a place in it.
Anyway, agree on pay too. Like I said, young men join to go use their power and have adventure in a way that's sanctioned by the state. And heritage military families do it out of tradition. That has been destroyed with DEI and the social situation domestically.
The only benefit to service is that a bunch of like minded young men might meet each other as the situation goes to shit and they have the unity, literally from their unit or whatever, to do something about it. Which I guess is just Roman Auxilliary situation.

I mean, the totality of the faggotry is degrading the ability of the force to do it's job; the DEI/ESG discourages white men from joining, and ruins retention. And no one wants to see a man in a women's uniform, ever.

From there, it's an easy step to ask if you want to work 13 hour days doing bullshit work, never take a paid vacation when you want to, and be actively discouraged from seeking medical attention when you're ill. 90k/yr plus BAH would maybe counter the normal gayness of military life, but even if they magically solved all the political/social/sexual problems, no one is going to bite when all the "fREe StUFf" has been outed as worthless too

Nope. It’s your time, young man. The uniparty has already decided for you. you may even get to go in as an E2 if you use enough DEI buzzwords at your draft station

>and come from inferior cultures
woah woah woah there buddy, there's no such thing as inferior cultures according to Boas because there's no such thing as superior cultures.
Boasian Theory is injected into everything, especially government bureaucracy. everything DEI and woke shit is originally based on Boasian Theory.
Boas, being a kike, just superimposed his Talmudic views onto Anthropology. All races are Goyim and all cultures are equally sub-human from the kike point of view.

Boasian Theory is why immigration floods happened in all of our nations with synchronicity.

Yes, they need to make room for all the DEI applicants who otherwise wouldn't qualify, and still won't qualify when they're graduated.

what makes you think the civil war is going to be goofballs? The glowies and zogbots are both the revolution, and the establishment.
Just waiting for the line in the sand to be drawn.
Why do you think they're demoralizing the miliary with rainbow diversity shit and the feds with deradicalization/demoralization and DEI propaganda and law enforcement with inversions of the law and political fodder like floyd? They know its coming. Its been ongoing for decades now.

>this shit is fucked up from so many angles and really won’t ever be fixed
TRUTH! I worked at a MAJOR teaching hospital. The incoming resident doctors are almost pants-on-head retarded with the amount of hand-holding required. The younger incoming nurses are legit retarded. The anti-White sentiment is unbearable and a huge reason why I left the nursing profession. Drug addicts LOVE to threaten "racism" over not getting all the narcs they demand, and the change from before is that now, you have administration believing this shit. I saw too many friends get caught up in that shit so I peaced out while I could. The DEI nonsense is rot that will destroy healthcare. My nigger coworkers literally get away with negligently contributing to the deaths of patients while my White coworkers got reamed for the tiniest of perceived infractions. If you want a window into the future of healthcare, just look at the old stories of King Drew Hospital in Los Angeles. Nigger-tier care by nigger staff.

This thread is black-and-redpilled as fuck.
The issue from which all this stems is jews.
jews run the (((insurance industry))) and that drives up costs
jews run immigration policy, which imports subhumans pretending to be doctors
jews promote DEI policies in med schools that biases against whites and their empathetic qualities needed for successful physician care
jews control the pharma industry that drives so much of medical environment and policies
jews run the investment control of healthcare systems that forces cost cutting over sustainability
