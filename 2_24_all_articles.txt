sure there was wind tunnels and refinements, etc, but the idea went from mind to metal faster then than it does now.
the 787, k-46a, 777X, 737-max - all planes after the 777, turned into fucking shitshows.
its because engineers are utterly reliant on computers and cant think for shit and tons of DEI/DIE ESG hiring has pumped too many subhuman and nigger brains in all working for cheap fucking jews.

Welcome to /fed/, fellow internet traveler!

In this thread, we will discuss how the State is the supreme authority in all matters of faith and morality. And if the State made something illegal, then it must be bad. And likewise the reverse: if the State made something that was once illegal now legal, then it must be fine now because the State knows what's best for us and for our children.

Don't forget to watch your weekly cartoons with le sophisticated epic humor only us smart atheists can understand like Rick & Morty; why grow up when you could be perpetually childish and the State promises to provide everything for everyone with equality of outcome. Fellow atheists of the world unite, we're tired of being oppressed by having to hear someone mention their opposing faith in public or hearing opinions which don't align with the State. We need more censorship and control of information, the State sponsored and State school indoctrinated worldview is just not being adopted by the people fast enough.

And before someone asks, no, our religious blind faith in the theory tale of evolution and of nothing creating everything being tax-funded doesn't bother us at all. After all, we're just heckin animals made of stardust, right my fellow science mammals? Just like the whale, another mammal, which the State government schools say used to walk on legs. And the State would never lie to us, because we trust the State, because the State gives us free and fair elections, and the State officials didn't endorse and support and incite widespread domestic terrorism against anyone who went against the State's agendas in 2020, and the State officials never broke their own unconstitutional edicts and illegal orders which never applied to globalist mega corporations but only to local stores and small family businesses, and the State ensures our borders are protected, and we've always been at war with Eastasia.

p.s. The bacon narwhals at midnight, amirite, my fellow DEI allies?

this exact format/story should be copied and reproduced in all countries in their own languages and settings, like "Ugly Betty". I truly believe that by the end of the first season it would change society overnight, and it could be rehashed with couples of different races for different audiences if you live in a multicultural country and it wouldn't be annoying the way DEI policies do it. The spic version "La Maestra de las Bromas Teresa-San" would completely destroy narco-culture and then maybe we could start having fun again.

She then fucked an employee and gave him $750K from the DA's office which she used to go on vacations and buy shit for herself. He was also cheating on his wife who divorced him. She and he then perjured themselves on the stand and are about to get the Trump case dismissed and they'll go to prison. She handed Trump the election and proved all of the cases were just political hit jobs. Democrats and MSM are panicking.

We're seeing a bit of it already. The current state of it is that companies need to hit their quotas so they stick their diversity hires into useless positions of little impact. It'll basically just result in greater pushback on the practice as the diversity hires sometimes filter through to higher positions. I mean that's the stage we're at right now as it is. Middle class voting habits will likely shift more republican as a result of DEI alone and Trump's already running ahead again as it is. I mean I think Democrats realize all of this and that's part of why they're so big on amnesty and immigration, they want to import faster than the scales of public opinion can shift. It's really getting fucked up by hispanics and blacks shifting parties if that *is* really happening, we'll see how it goes this election. We'll likely see legal action and legislation against DEI in our lifetimes if it is true.

You need to go to college with a plan to become educated, network, get internships, graduate, and hit the ground running. The old days are over. Like, I remember a while ago I was reading at a Starbucks and there was this group of teenagers sitting next to me. They were talking about how they were all going to go to Ohio State (not anywhere near Ohio) and were super excited, but it was about like, partying and football and all that. I'm not going to beat up on those kids and sometimes I wonder about how it all went for them, but yea you can't go to college with that mindset unless your family is rich and connected.

If you do go to college, study, get good grades, get educated, network, get internships, etc., I still think there's a lot of opportunity out there. Unfortunately there is now much less so if you are White and I would recommend lying about Hispanic or Native American ancestry. The fact is the entire DEI regime depends on Whites accepting their second-class status without complaint. If you check off the NA or Hispanic box, they can't check, they can't follow-up, they can't even legally ask you about it. It's the honor system. So just lie. It doesn't matter, and I think companies are actually fine with this arrangement because it pumps up their diversity numbers while also getting qualified and competent Whites in the building - win-win.

Black people lack the part of the brain that simulates future events. They simply don't have the brain morphology - it's not really their fault. To them, the future is truly an abstract concept they cant fully grasp, their own self in the present is not able to understand their future selfs situation if they do X, Y or Z. Simply put, planning for anything outside of the immediate future doesn't benefit them since far future them, ie next harvest, is a stranger to them entirely.

It's sad but this is the reality - a few black people have some mixed genes and therefore have some of the correct brain structure but they're rare, and only use is to be paraded by jews and their DEI innitiative as 'see, black people are as smart as normal people'. lol.

If you're a serial killer it's easy to convince the public you're a genius.
They (the public) will observantly listen to every flick of the tongue, look for subtleties in the eyes. Try to guess if they would have guessed.
If they earnestly believe you to be 'normal', they'll rank you a genius and a master manipulator. Sometimes rooted in arrogance of their own perception, and naive understanding of humanity. Suprised and excited when a man doesn't have horns, drool or pretend to be mad. 'How can this be!' 'I don't understand!'.
Most regular people live alienated double lives, back stage and front stage. A serial killer is no more a genius for appearing 'normal' than a conservative not sperging at a DEI training session, or a progressive biting their tongue at a perceived microaggression. I'd put it that both are infinitely more impressive manipulators due to being hobbled by empathy. The killer is merely playing a higher stakes game with a better hand. All have the capacity to lie and cheat, it's necessary and mundane. Fascination = identification of themselves disguised as interest in extreme human nature. Fascination not with psychopathy but with their own manipulation and alienation. Murders as burst of 'reality' in public life.
Broad sense of unacknowledged alienation in public life = letters to the jail etc. Humour can puncture and allay. Women no bants? Women conform.
Past pale- Mr Alkaline..'we had no idea, he was such a nice man', 'I don't think it's possible'. Secret thrill.
Interested because they don't understand? Actually cos they do..
Element of capacity for cruelty which is appealing. The ability to be cruel, which paradoxically evokes an aura of safety. Obvious sexual element, particularly for people who have been abused- regression to childhood, reenacting abusive relationship projected onto other (attempt to feel better). This too alienation, unresolved private desires manifesting in public life. Worship of fame/shame.

Which doesn't matter. One leftist isn't funneling massive amounts of immigrants into the west on a systemic level. One leftist isn't making it illegal to have white skin on a systemic level (DEI). Jewish zionist political groups like the ADL and the SPLC and Jewish politicians are doing those things on a systemic level.

>so naturally in a case like this the defence will just be trying to get niggers on the jury because the whole trial is irrelevant to them only the race of the parties involved so even if some nigger on the jury 100% knows their monkey is evil they would still refuse to convict.

Worse than that. All the defense has to do is keep choosing nigger upon nigger. After the white prosecutor rejects a couple, he's sweating knowing the DEI jews are openly tracking how many niggers he rejects. The defense is PRAYING for an all-white jury after several niggers are rejected, knowing that's automatic grounds for dismissal on grounds of racism.

Blacks are going to find out they had it easy when whites were a majority. When the spics take all of the USA you are going to have brazil tier levels of corruption and violence. You are going to have a spic police force controlled by spic politicians and gangs. You are going to have a judicial system run by spics. Those people dont give a flying fuck about any notions of justice, equality, or human rights, it comes down to how much money they can squeeze out of anyone with less power than them. They make corruption in white countries look like lunch swaps in preschools. Blacks are not just going to be relegated to second class citizens, they are going to become virtual non-entities. Affirmative action, DEI hiring, welfare, section 8 housing, busing, its all going out the window.

This agent's blatant attempt to deceive about manipulating the hiring process reflects a disturbing lack of integrity and ethical responsibility. Let's break down the egregious aspects of their approach:

1. Victim Mentality:
> "normal white men are discriminated against in hiring"

This framing perpetuates a victim mentality without substantiating the claim. Instead of addressing concerns about discrimination constructively, the agent resorts to a divisive narrative that oversimplifies complex issues.

2. Exploitative Strategy:
> "Every job you apply to asks about race, gender, and disability status."

The agent not only acknowledges the existence of diversity-related questions but contemplates exploiting them for personal gain. This reveals a willingness to engage in deceptive practices to manipulate the system.

3. Identity Misrepresentation:
> "I could claim to be multi-racial, or just 'other', I can say I have a disability since the list includes meme shit like adhd."

The agent openly discusses the possibility of lying about their race and disability status. This not only compromises their own integrity but also undermines the legitimacy of diversity initiatives aimed at addressing real disparities.

4. Devaluation of DEI Efforts:
> "What's the best way to play the DEI game?"

Referring to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts as a "game" exposes a cynical mindset. It suggests a complete disregard for the genuine intent behind these initiatives, reducing them to a strategic maneuver rather than a commitment to fairness.

In the context of the specific issues involving Judge Andre Borrello and the 10th Circuit Court, the agent's proposed actions not only lack ethical grounding but also contribute to the erosion of trust in systems designed to promote equity and combat discrimination. Their approach is not only reprehensible but also counterproductive to fostering a truly inclusive and just society.

Modern feminism is a billion dollar business and is part of what can broadly be called the grievance industries. So there is a financial incentive to continue to propagate the necessity of feminism. To this end we see academics come up with new grievances or shift the goal posts on old grievances. Examples would be how the definition of the wage gap have changed and the introduction of the "mental load" of mothers and wives. As these concepts are created and developed in the insular environment of gender studies departments they do not get challenged as vigorously as they should be because these departments filter out anyone with the "wrong" ideas. These concepts are then disseminated to the general population by DEI groups and social media grifters both of which feed womens need to feel like a "victim". I put victim in quotation marks because they aren't actual victims, but by playing victim and using the concepts of feminism they are able to gain power as there are social repercussions for questioning victims

This discriminatory policy follows a trend of major corporations prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) over equality. Disney was recently hit with a federal civil rights complaint for using diversity metrics to determine employee bonuses. The complaint alleges Disney intentionally discriminates against white American men, Christians, and Jews based solely on their race, sex, and religion.

As Breitbart News reported:

America First Legal filed the complaint against Disney on Wednesday. The group cited publicly available documents published on Disney’s official sites as well as leaked internal documents showing how executives have made diversity, equity, and inclusion a central part of Disney’s hiring practices.

“It is sad and tragic that a company whose name was once synonymous with wholesome and charming childhood fantasies is now dedicated to spreading divisive bigotry. We urge Disney to cease and desist its unlawful and destructive conduct at once,” said Stephen Miller, president of America First Legal and former Trump administration official.

It's literally because of christcuckolds pretending all races are equal and equally valuable in the eyes of God so they collect donations and launder millions of dollars every year through NGOs for secretly hiring cayotes to import as many non-humans as they can to saturate all White countries with DEI hires at all levels of gov and private institutions.

He's not wrong. It's spear headed by big business taking advantage of tax treaties. You can hire non-u.s citizens right now and not pay payroll tax or workers compensation. Couple that with dei incentive programs and you have a legislated disincentivization program targeting white Americans males.

This outlines the payroll tax breaks businesses get from hiring non-u.s citizens. There are new laws coming down the pike. States, both republican and Democrat controlled, are offering businesses even greater deals to fill the ranks with anyone but white male locals.

There's no point in them asking questions.

You tell them about some antics at an office party, they don't hire you because you're a liability.

You tell them how you've never been to an office party, they don't hire you for not being outgoing.

They just don't like you the second you walk in the room.

I knew my last interview was over when the DEI lady rolled her eyes at me the second i walked in the room.

By establishing a difference between East Asians and Indian Asians. My Uber liberal company that I used to work for had an outrage from East Asians when they started boasting about how many “Asians” they hired that year. The East Asian people wanted to know how many of them were East Asian vs Indian and they just went like “uhhhh we don’t know we don’t track that”.
The problem is Indians are a gold mine for companies. They count towards dei incentives (Asian) while working for much much less than real asians

This haunts me every night. I have to retain a certain number of Indians, blacks, women and queers in pointless positions, to stop lawsuits. I have a ratio of 12:1. For every twelve competent and productive white men. I have to hire one useless DEI hire. I usually keep them in low level positions where they can’t damage anything. Or give them managerial titles and a small team of people I don’t like, to basically abuse. If I don’t like someone and can’t fire them. I send them to work with the minority hires. They usually end up quitting after a few weeks. My managers and people loyal to me all know this and carry it out. I never tell them to or instruct them to. So just in case of there’s a snitch.

Thank you, this needed to be said and reinforces what a clusterfuck things are now for the average worker. Used to be if you were talented and did your job, they left you alone. You made them money and they paid you for it.

The VP and my supervisor both got asked to resign over innocent feedback they gave in the MONTHLY DEI zoom call (recorded). I was in the meeting and all they said was "hey, I mean I don't agree that all white people are oppressors." They were very nice about it, gave examples, etc. but the niggers in charge said they be disrepecfoo n sheeitt and that was it. Both told they weren't fit to lead in "a diverse organization".

The blacks that replaced them were so much more professional. Legit race-baited all the time. "Where da white women at" at every meeting (because only men were in the meeting, I suppose"... and my personal favorite was being told "all white people need to get hit in the head" and "y'all should have all been killed befo y'all got off da boat". Meaning colonizers.

So there is a racial component here, too.

>are people bi?
Pew answered this years ago. The most telling part was that out of all “bi” people surveyed those who were in same-sex relationships constituted a single-digit percentage. Out of all “bi” people surveyed less than around 30% considered their sexuality as an important part of their identity. “Bi” is either about attention or partaking in the LGBTQ+ community due to status/trend and an even smaller subset of people aware of DEI practices and using this as leverage in professional settings e.g. claiming to be trans, native American, hispanic, etc. women in general are like water, shapeless, they react to what’s attempting to shape them. Women were taken as spoils in warfare over thousands of years, they evolved accordingly. Opinionated women are usually signaling for consensus/zeitgeist as being part of the community around them, there are feminized and hylic men who do the same, but what’s attractive to a woman is man and authentic masculinity, not in some steroid-abusing bloated metrosexual powerlifter but in a man who is somewhat fit and healthy but far more importantly is living his own life and pursuing his own goals, authentic confidence without insecurity, charming, funny, witty. Even being skinny-fat I have always been charming, even now with my hair starting to thin I’ve only been with attractive, skinny and fit women younger than myself, and most recently a girl cheated on her taller, fitter, richer boyfriend with me who at the time was not only making minimum wage but also living at home like a complete loser retard. That affair lasted half a year. Women are far less visual, yes you do have to be at least average in attraction especially the face, but their attraction otherwise is about how you make them feel. Hence they go for those who make them feel protected, happy, make them laugh, etc. they personalize their feelings, so when you make them feel a certain way they’re aware that YOU are responsible for this

From the Washington Post, Ackman shifted his worldview. What made him change it? No surprise:
>But the tumultuous years of the pandemic had shifted the Wall Street billionaire’s worldview. Like others in his uber-wealthy circles, Ackman had come to believe that well-meaning ESG efforts had curdled into something pernicious, stifling debate, destroying careers and undermining the meritocratic values that made the free-market system “the most powerful potential force for good in addressing society’s long-term problems,” as he once put it…

>In hours of interviews with The Washington Post, Ackman, who is Jewish, argued that campus responses to the Oct. 7 attack had been lackluster compared with the solidarity shown post-George Floyd. To Ackman, the contrast exposed the hypocrisy of the movement for “diversity, equity and inclusion,” or DEI — which includes race-based hiring goals and diversity trainings he called “unhealthy” and the “root cause of antisemitism.”

Doesn’t aound like a crusade for White people to me.

Their hatred of Israel is mostly due to the latest update in their NPC software and they perceive Israel as more oppressive white people of a different flavor.

I hate Israel and Jews for creating these LGBT pride fags, championing their ideology to destroy the birth-rates of my people, and supporting kumbaya DEI multicultural insanity that is now the reason there are parallel societies of non-whites all over the western world while we, the heritage citizens, are told we have to tolerate it.

Wait really? So does that mean that anti-whiteness should be criminalized asap and only anti-billionaireness should be allowed? You get completely deplatformed out of society if you call niggers "niggers" in the west. It doesn't mean ghetto or billionaire. Call Kanye a nigger on twitter and you'll lose your twitter account or have it be blacklisted. But call a poor white coal miner a republican country bumpkin cracker idiot who needs to be imprisoned for first being white and second for voting for Trump, and you'll be all fine and clapped at.

So, if we were to apply your relativism of what a white is or isn't, then we should shield all poor white people from all sorts of anti-white racism or anti-colonial speech and ban nigger activists when they try to bundle American whites as a monolith that must be collectively punished and collectively forced to pay reparations. Not all whites were slave owners and many of them came as indentured servants of the British Empire, a prime victim of colonialism and imperialism themselves. Applying this type of relativism, niggers are now banned from criticizing rural whites for the things that Trump the billionaire did, and all sorts of collective punishment should be seen as hate speech, not excluding the collective punishment of displacing white people from their jobs in decolonial diversity quotas. We should only displace whites that are above a million in net worth give or take, and all lower class whites should be equal-in-oppression as the other DEI-privileged people. A straight white man who grew up in a poor rural village is now equal to a crippled trans nigger who grew up in LA.

Will any of this happen? Will you prove to me that the white race does not exist and apply exclusions to 99% of whites, and only target the 1%?

No one basically has expendible money to fuck these women anymore. If they do, they aren't travelling.

You are being lied to on a scale never before seen in the history of humanity, and it all comes down to words and how they are used. Each word is a tool, is a weapon to achieve a desired outcome. These weapons are being used to enslave you and wipe you out.
When something benefits a white man, it is racist and discriminatory. Racism is evil, and evil needs to be eradicated. When someone is racist, you can now openly attack them without fear of consequences. In fact, you might be attacked for not attacking a person who is racist.
When something benefits a non-white man, it is diversity equity and inclusion. Diversity equity and inclusion is a virtue to be celebrated. You are required to praise people who engage in DEI, and if you don’t, you might be attacked for not celebrating DEI.

But wait, there’s more

Women are empowered. You are required to be an ally of women. Women are equal to men. They deserve all the same rights as a man. Women deserve equal pay, equal rights, and equal representation in government. Women are strong and powerful and we should raise them up to be leaders. Oh but there’s a problem. War broke out in Ukraine. Remember all that stuff about equality and women’s rights? You have to forget all that and now you have to embrace traditional roles. Men are required to fight and die for their country and women can flee the country with kids. Why? Because someone has to take care of the kids, right? Of course when there wasn’t a War, taking care of the kids was sexist and misogynistic and if you dared say that you’d be attacked and cancelled. 16 year old boys have guns put to their heads and they are threatened with death if they refuse to fight in the War, women fled with the children. And when the war is over the women will come back, and once again they will be empowered and equal and you will be attacked if you question it.

What is the solution? What is the answer? How do you solve the greatest challenge the world has ever known?

Climate crisis, attacks on farming, carbon taxes, migration, ESG/DEI/LGBTQ/pro-trans, CRT, CSE sex ed for little kids in public schools - ALL that garbage comes from the UN 2030 agenda.

As opposed to the current system? At least with UBI everyone gets some money instead of the government picking and choosing based on DEI who gets it. The bigger problem with UBI is the effect it'll have on inflation.

So I was listening to a podcast episode called Is c++ dying? The existential threats give are
>300 member committee wont ship a language feature in the next 10 years
>corporations are pulling out their engineering hours & funding to create successor languages
>Diversity https://adspthepodcast.com/2023/10/06/Episode-150.html 40 minute mark

Diversity? WTF. I listened through again. The jew hides behind insinuations. The only way to make sense of what he's saying is
>the angle of death is coming for accidentally "white" communities like the c++ committee

This kind of rhetoric
>The majority of those who consider themselves a member of an underrepresented or marginalized group in technology identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or otherwise non-heterosexual. The second most selected option was neurodivergent at 41% followed by trans at 31.4%. Going forward, it will be important for us to track these figures over time to learn how our community changes and to identify the gaps we need to fill.
>As Rust continues to grow, we must acknowledge the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI)-related gaps that exist in the Rust community. Sadly, Rust is not unique in this regard. For instance, only 20% of 2023 respondents to this representation question consider themselves a member of a racial or ethnic minority and only 26% identify as a woman. We would like to see more equitable figures in these and other categories. In 2023, the Rust Foundation formed a diversity, equity, and inclusion subcommittee on its Board of Directors whose members are aware of these results and are actively discussing ways that the Foundation might be able to better support underrepresented groups in Rust

presupposes that people are going to start to be dragged out into the street and brutally *** for being part of too white communities.

Picrel. White Americans brought this upon themselves. Enjoy your offices full of DEI hires and foreigners. If something doesn't change, whites will literally become a burger-flipping Dalit class in America.

In a country that's over 70% white, you have an ever-decreasing chance of being hired because every major company is now being staffed by people who literally refuse to hire your kind, and who only bring in people of the same mentality.

The only people buying homes anymore in this country are Indian and Chinese. The American Dream is rapidly collapsing for the people who built this country and is being sold out to the third world.

If our government was truly "by the people, of the people, and for the people" I might agree with A5 anon on this point. But almost every legislator and presidential candidate is bought and paid for by a foreign political action committee, most of the executive branch heads are dual citizens, our military is more interested in DEI initiatives and protecting foreign borders than our own border, and many of our judges and DAs are selected and campaign funded by foreign-backed NGOs. And that's just the obvious stuff off the top of my head.

Our country has basically fallen in a coup by foreign interests with alien priorities in the past few decades. Our country (political organization) is no longer represents our nation (a people occupying a land with common blood and beliefs).

What remains worth defending? Unless we clean it the hell up and do it quickly. Texas at least with this border action with its allied states is at least taking a small but meaningful step in the right direction.

Companies need to conform to DEI regulations or they get taxed extra. Part of the regulations state that your company has to have a certain percentage of minorities and women. Since tech is almost 100% a white male industry, getting competent people other than white males is very hard. That's why there are so many pajeets in Silicon Valley.

These women are given extremely easy jobs so that they stay in the company and serve as the bulwark against extra taxes. They were also the first ones to be let go when the restrictions eased in 2023. That's why you saw companies laying off so many people. It was all of these useless DEI hires that dragged down the company.

why is it so hard for conservative retards to admit they're living on stolen land? obviously the land belonged to someone before you got there and when you got there you either genocided the natives or waged prolonged wars which they could not sustain because of their limited population whereas your retarded race was breeding like rabbits and had no shortage of soldiers to fight for their king or queen or whatever cuck you retards worshipped at the time. historically, every established empire would wipe out native populations or turn them into slaves and that's exactly what has happened across the last 500 years of history. if you are not willing to admit that you are living on stolen land, even before we get to the destruction of the native fauna and flora then you are retarded.

So my mom works as a volunteer at a local museum. It's a the 'shipping museum' it's basically a museum about the local shipping industry over the centuries, a lot of it is for kids, you know lots of activities like you get to hold a cannon ball or calculate the distance between islands on a map, fun stuff. Anyway, she's retired and is mostly just looking for something to do especially in the winter when she can't garden.

Anyway my mom really knows her shit, her family has lived in the area for a couple of hundred years, her dad actually worked at a local port during the war as a crane operator. So she knows all the old sea yarns as she says. The museum was started in the 60s with a grant from the gov plus some money from local shipping companies as a gift For a long time the museum was staffed by people who had worked in the local industry and their kids and in general it was just a way to keep the history of the region alive. But overtime people have died and become too old and so the museum has had to find new workers and volunteers.

Enter the university students

It started slow a few years ago with this native woman and later this black woman, and then later other people. It was subtle at first almost un noticable but slowly these two and others have tried to insert DEI shit into what the museum does. Native stuff, stuff about slavery, which is ironic because this Canada so come the fuck on.

This is getting long, whatever now they want to have everyone who gives tours to make one of those 'statement of recognition things . 'We are on stolen land bla bla bla slavery etc'. My mom doesn't wanna do it, but she also just doesn't wanna make a big deal about it. I hate these people why do they have to ruin everything?

Are you a White man who's having a hard time getting a job?
Maybe that's because one of the world's biggest investors, BlackRock, requires all companies it invests in to follow their DEI guidelines, which include anti-White hiring policies.

https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/commitment-to-dei

Not only does BlackRock practice DEI themselves, except for the executives themselves of course, but their investment decisions are driven by DEI and ESG metrics.
If you have a company and you want BlackRock money, you must agree to discriminate against Whites and you must prove to BlackRock that you are doing it.
BlackRock was founded by a group of jews, and is run by jew Larry Fink.
Do you have a 401k? Odds are good BlackRock is handling your money. Using your own retirement money to coerce other businesses into discriminating against you.

If you criticize Fink, be prepared to get called an antisemite and to hear about the holocaust.

The Greatest evil the world has ever known is not in your history books, it is happening right now, today.
You are being lied to on a scale never before seen in the history of humanity, and it all comes down to words and how they are used. Each word is a tool, is a weapon to achieve a desired outcome. These weapons are being used to enslave you and wipe you out.
When something benefits a white man, it is racist and discriminatory. Racism is evil, and evil needs to be eradicated. When someone is racist, you can now openly attack them without fear of consequences. In fact, you might be attacked for not attacking a person who is racist.
When something benefits a non-white man, it is diversity equity and inclusion. Diversity equity and inclusion is a virtue to be celebrated. You are required to praise people who engage in DEI, and if you don’t, you might be attacked for not celebrating DEI.

But wait, there’s more

Women are empowered. You are required to be an ally of women. Women are equal to men. They deserve all the same rights as a man. Women deserve equal pay, equal rights, and equal representation in government. Women are strong and powerful and we should raise them up to be leaders. Oh but there’s a problem. War broke out in Ukraine. Remember all that stuff about equality and women’s rights? You have to forget all that and now you have to embrace traditional roles. Men are required to fight and die for their country and women can flee the country with kids. Why? Because someone has to take care of the kids, right? Of course when there wasn’t a War, taking care of the kids was sexist and misogynistic and if you dared say that you’d be attacked and cancelled. 16 year old boys have guns put to their heads and they are threatened with death if they refuse to fight in the War, women fled with the children. And when the war is over the women will come back, and once again they will be empowered and equal and you will be attacked if you question it.

The real problem is that people become agents of the Managerial Revolution because there is no bourgeois presence in shit like software. The GOP will get nowhere due to tech illiteracy. The Dems don't have this problem because despite being retards, they all submit to the managerial machine, "trust the experts, trust the science" etc. it's just how they carry themselves instinctually.

Programmers with agency tend to be lolbert types or Trump guys simply because we hate immigration and we're full of spite. No one really seems capable of leading anyone.

This is why we must abandon the death kneel that is conservatism entirely. Avoid jew charlatans like Shapiro and their nerd ethno-narcissist talking points. Instead look at the few capable and not-retarded leaders democracy has produced recently like Bukele and try to avoid the mistake of Trump in trying to cozy up with a portion of the managerial, offer favors to them (doing shit for Israel etc). Ultimately though conservatism offers nothing. It's a dead and fake and gay non-ideology and that's why autists like programmers see right through it.

If conservatism was a real threat, people would be treated far worse who classify themselves and their do-nothing orgs as conservative. Instead the last thing that actually did something was OWS. After that, since there is nothing left to conserve, the financial managerial elite immediately began forming DEI, lgbt agenda, BLM embraced, etc etc it was allowed to carry over to the extent of religious fervor. This was because OWS was actually a thread, bourgeois people were pissed off as well and those two elements together spell disaster for JP Morgan and the like.

Think less like Alex "the retard" Jones and more like Teddy Roosevelt bros. Enough with this dead impotent maulding ideology.

I've been in tech for over 15 years and rage quit my last two jobs and currently unemployed. I was working for a 50-60 people consulting company that had a big restaurant chain as a client and everything was so fucking terrible. A restaurant chain somehow had over 5,000 git repos. A Python application that created tickets in ServiceNow was somehow over 100,000 lines of code. There was as many leads/PMs/shitters as devs. Morning stand-up meeting would be 30 minutes of people talking about shit no else cares about. Then there was sprint planning, grooming (whoever named this can die in a fire), retro etc. Hours worth of useless shit meetings per week. Now here comes the best part, most companies big and small are like this. That's why I'm trying to do my own thing now. When I started, it was mostly geeks/nerds, mostly White and Asian and the occasional diversity, but they actually pulled their weight. Greedy kikes (gotta invest in the next thing) normies (the big salary bro) and DEI (incompetent shitskins can code too bro) ruined the whole fucking sector.

In the 60s the teams were entirely composed if White Men. That meant better cooperation, more trust, more honesty, etc. among the group. How NASA has POC put into positions they can't handle and the actual smart people are smart enough not to call it out because they know they'd be fired. So we end up with unqualified minorities making decisions they don't understand and qualified Whites afraid to speak up when it's necessary. DEI is only going to continue to bring more and more failures.

My company is interviewing interns right now and one of the candidates is a nearly 30 year old Indian who got his Bachelors in the mid 2010s and is now getting a masters so he can come here and take a job from an American. Guys, this is absolutely part of the reason you’re struggling to find internships.

There are literally millions of Indians lined up to come take these jobs, and there are DEI departments, legal counsel, and recruiting pipelines specifically set up to make it happen. And then there are the mostly Indian interview panels shooing them in. It’s actually insane and most people have no idea this is how it works. There's massive momentum here, and I expect in a handful of years there will be basically no Americans in tech anymore.

We regularly hire students straight out of India who can't write basic code or answer basic technical questions. Of course, they've all gotten their masters somewhere in the US, which allows them to be brought in on OPT/H1B visas more easily. I'm one of the only Americans working in tech, and with each passing year there are fewer and fewer. I assume most Americans are managed out eventually.

I work at a big F500 btw. You probably don't know the name but you definitely rely on our products/services. The tech industry has become so anti-American that it pains me to be a part of it, but there aren't many other options for Americans trying to attain a middle-class life anymore.

Unironically, it was to make the stock price go up. The company, a well-known engineering brand name, did have some problems. However, the root of the problems was the upper level management making bad decisions, shifting to offshore jeets for engineering change management (in addition to importing jeets to the USA and Germany), and frankly the worst psychopaths rising up to become managers and directors. When we add to this DEI (i.e., Do Not Hire White Men), the system breaks down. I will say, my colleagues were shocked that I was being let go: the manager/director under whom I got reassigned genuinely did not understand what my team did. Fuck him, I hope he gets FDA audits up his fag ass. I was given no severance despite being there for 5 years. (At least I can claim unemployment benefits.)

Punishing big capital when it misbehaves is a good thing. China still understands this which is why you don’t see the kind of DEI tyranny being forced on its population in the workplace like in the US and most of Europe.

This was common sense until 40 years ago with emergence of the neoliberal consensus primarily pushed by the WEF allowed massive multinational conglomerates to form and essentially control national politics via strangling economies and destroying jobs intentionally if their politicians or population don’t get on board.

You are a retard who wants two incompatible things (a moral, staunchly conservative society and a totally free market system).

>complex systems won't survive the competency crisis
the hilarious thing is that not only do these companies not have a functional quality assurance process, but even if they did, it would not work because instead of fucking engineers, they have political consultants
before you release something, you:
>test to make sure it works
>test to make sure it doesn't do anything unexpected or fail

these retards tried to insert their political bias into an incredibly complex system
the funny thing is that they're too stupid to understand how it works because rather than making it a product requirement, because they're too stupid to understand how it works and don't hire good engineers and instead hire purple-hair trannies and faggots that look like Vaush, their attempt at making "equity" in AI was just adding a layer to it at the very end that randomly inserts "ethnic, black, pansexual" to whatever prompt you did

and in validation, no one cares, because even if the product fails, they're kept afloat with BlackRock DEI/IED/EDI/EID/whatever the fuck they're calling it now money

then after they lose a fuckton of talent, BlackRock threatens to pull funding if they don't chase half-baked, retarded DEI initiatives rather than making a functional product

Listen I don't know much about computers, other than the one I got at home and my mom put a few games on it and I play them..


In all seriousness,
What will be the eventual outcome over this battle over nerfed AI? Clearly, people like you are gonna want a non nerfed version of AI to create images and text at your leisure be that home grown Taylor Swift lesbo pron or JEET SHEEEITS IN THE STREET! web comics. For now as far as my understanding it's a little tough for an individual to run a setup doing their own version of AI as it takes quite a bit of processing power so something like chat GPT or this Google Gemini thing are basically just run on servers where you Mr Abstract Merchant enjoyer are asking for a query that it delivers back to you. Presumably in the next 3-5 years the requirements for this kind of AI program (text and image generation) will come down a bit as we become a bit more nimble at programming it and the natural augmentation of processing power that can be 'done at home' so to speak continues, will there be laws passed to try to curtail enterprising young wippersnappers like yourselves who enjoy a hearty kek from running your own AI?

For my part, I just have trouble believing that they are going to be able to keep a lid on this ..some people are always gonna want a non Nerfed version, purely on a practical level. Imagine if you were for example an illustrator of children's books using AI to help you out, you wouldn't want a DEI version of the American Revolution or the Middle Ages because (shocker) that wouldn't sell as well as doing it properly.

Also,
Can it be? Act like you know nigga!

>we can send a chimp to space, we done it before we can do it again.
Why is it important he's african. There's fucking 50 human races why it always has to be fucking africans. DEI goes to space.
Also the 'star trek' shit, you can't procure that ideal without robust ethnostates of same size, otherwise you're not going to have a global multiethnic society, you just going to have the large territorial races overrun the smaller ones, and it's going be nothing but that monotony and the mixed hybrids left, that are going to be the world population. USA retards don't even know how to procure their own ideal, they do the exact opposite, the dumb masons who wrote star trek etc. are heading in the exact opposite direction of what they should be doing. Didn't gene roddenberry explain to them. It's even in the lore. You need robust ethnostates of same size to establish the planetary federation, they all established peace and ended war cause they all have exact same amount for each LOL and created then a ressource based economy and globally shared ressources. It's literally the star trek lore. All races preserved, all same territory, all populations same size, nothing to invade eachother over, nothing to fight eachother over. Ressource based economy all get exactly same amount of ressources. Peace on earth. Always guarantees a multiethnic crew on the spaceships cause that's what earth then is. A totally even multiethnic society even. It's perfection rather than USA a fucking mess of all these other races just overrunning europeans lol.
What do masons do in real life? The exact opposite. Try to fucking turn half the planet into africans.

we live in an extremely feminized society brought on by Juden and shitlibs that leaves no room for greater ambitions or achievements (typically a masculine trait) because we have every resource available (food water and shelter) so women dont want to marry men anymore who typically fought off the neighboring tribe or hunted animals to provide for the group and so the birth rate collapses and decadence sets in. Once it does, society becomes a popularity contest which women excel at and it will also introduce degenerate behavior like the current gender craziness, DEI and so on. And it will continue until rebels storm the walls.
Its like the Chinese emperor never left the walls of the castle, surrounded by corrupt eunuchs and his disloyal and cowardly generals. He will only how fucked his whole empire is when Mongols or Rebels storm the wall. Our elites are some of the most disconnected out of any elite in history.

This graph is actually far worse than it looks. Not only because inflation numbers are falsified but because this is ALL WORKER pay.
So do some basic math. Real Female Pay has increased, it has tripled in past 50 years.
So has Real Nigger Pay and Real Spic Pay.
So, if pay of niggers women and spics are all UP, but overall pay is about EVEN, then what does that mean for white men? By necessity it means it is DOWN so that the other dei UPs add up to even.

DEI is going big and strong despite what your retard brain thinks because whatever Musk and other controlled op faggots say.
Nothing has changed other than Army making a couple ads that actually have white dudes in them.
If you are white and competent, the only work you will find is workhorse shit where they expect you to pick up the slack of the other 15 DEI employees who do nothing but play on their phone/gossip all day.
I work in IT (senior sys engineer) and am miserable. My skillset is massive but it doesn't matter, I still can't break six figs unless I had a TS Clearance, and fuck having Feds poke around the last 10 years of my life.
Basically if you are white and in IT you get to do the work of 15 people, while getting paid a bit less than them, and make half what your endless "diverse" managers make, who do nothing but hold meetings to schedule more meetings all day. It's actually a clique inside every globohomo company, the Teams/Zoom meeting class who do nothing but discuss "projects" and "strategy" with others in their clique using globohomo buzz words. Then they "delegate" the work they don't understand to those under them, even if it's not feasible or suitable for the environment, with the white man expected to pick up all the slack as it's the only reason they hired a white man in the first place
Only reason I haven't quit is because there's literally nothing better out there and I have my child to support.

We live in a merit based system. DEI departments are getting laid off across the board. Diversity hires eventually get fired and replaced by competent people.

One thing I've learned from my ~20 years working jobs; if I ever own a business, I'm only hiring straight white males.

I'm not paying women or gay people to gossip.
I'm not paying minorities to degrade the image of my brand through half-assing their work.

Company hires people based on DEI rules, and you call it a merit based system? I guess you're correct, technically you're right, but you have to specify what the merits are.

Usually when you say the word "merit" to a normal person, in work-related discussions, the first thing that comes to mind is "work results, company performance" and so on. But I guess we still do live in a merit based system, but the merit itself is different, the merit is "how much of a subversion to Whites are you" or something.

But ofcourse what happens. Their nations are shit because THEY ARE SHIT, they concoct this illusion that the reason x nation is nicer to live in, is not because their people are idiots. But because it's something like. 'Well france robbed africans' or something. Eventhough almost every african country is bigger than france, and has 200x more natural ressources than france, or whatever. Africnas for instance conclude this. And then they now go to france and have now TURNED PARIS INTO A SHITHOLE. becuase their idea of magic soil that they change via osmosis if they go to france, and just do minimum effort. Well they are still shit and so is going to be everything they touch.

Now fuck what 4chan says bunch of DEI anti european trash, trolls, agitators and shitters who ofcourse need to have their free speech completely removed, even more expedient than stopping mass immigration to any country.

But every NORMAL person totally normal, not 4chan roach, not reddit roach, not social media roach, knows that indians are neppo retards who ruin what they touch. Microsoft is a running joke every since neppo indians took it over. Look at office, hasn't fucking seen any improvement the last 8 years. Cause the stackoverflow indians just get paid to do nothing. Infact indians and jews are both neppo retards who never build or maintain anything, they need others do do it cause they are both neppo retards. Infact there's no difference between a caste indian and a talmudic jew. It's why indians kiss ass of jews so much i guess. Stupid banana eating retards who dream about ruling the entire planet.

Ofcourse they are. Non europeans were always problem, they are also the problem of race hate, they are the problem with everything and always were. They are too greedy they have way too much territory and natural ressources, and then on top of it whine and pretend as if it's idk polish people in poland or estonian people in estonia that are the problem instead of them.

Now that aside, everybody knows why this is happening in USA, but i also feel no sympathy with americans, cause american bastards are in general the nation and people who want this dumb shit the most. And are pushning race invasion and warfare on entire planet. (cause that's what mass immigration is). And so i feel absolutely no sympathy with americans for it backfiring on them on top of it.

Because it is bad enough you believe in handing over additional territory and natural ressources to these greedy non european scum who absolutely don't need. That's bad enough even if they behave like boyscouts and did everything perfectly and were also nice people. LOL imagine that pipedream.

My brother used to work at Boeing until quitting in 2018 just before the 737 max issues. He said he was being consistently passed up for promotions while DEI pajeets and South East Asians were getting pushed past him.
He worked as a machinist making parts at the Portland plant, and there was one part that kept getting sent back from the Seattle assembly plant telling them they were machining it wrong because it kept braking. After a few times of this my brother busted out the CAD files and started trying to figure out the problem.
After like 10 minutes looking at the files he realized the Pajeets were installing it backwards. He tells his supervisor, they fly him up to Seattle, he crawls inside the fuselage, and lo behold the part is in backwards. He didn't get a raise or bonus or anything. Said that was the final straw and quit to work for a small plane manufacturer.
If it's Boeing, I'm not going.

Good point. This is very much a form of violence in itself, in criminal law it is codified as assault (as opposed to battery). As you point out, the violence is broad, pervasive and unrelenting. It is tantamount to a state of siege, and I do not say that with hyperbole.

Open borders being invaded by hostile military age males who are openly given succor by the government at the expense of the natives, open anti-white advocacy and action from both arms of the ZOG fascist state (both the major corporations with DEI and cancel culture, and all levels of government with affirmative action and so-called hate crimes) putting mainstream white males in a constant state of fear. Everybody is waiting for a traditional war like World War II or Vietnam, and they fail to see this latest evolution of warfare, which white people are losing badly. I respectfully submit that although OP's heart is in the right place, his philosophy is a large part of the problem that got is here in the first place so I have little faith that it will now get us out of it.

My company DEI director allows the other DEI groups (fags, asians, etc) to openly verbally shit on the veterans group and she goes so far as to magically be on vacation whenever their are veterans events or forget to promote the events in the public comms channels. Glad you made it out alive.

Then after the models came out they just niggered and DEI'ed the shit out of it every fucking day making it worse and worse. Now it doesnt even do what you tell it because its so fucked left and right with anti white hate.

There is a binary in white men

One towards semitic Christ cuckery

and one towards our ancient genes berthed from the Imperium of Rome

We are slave drivers at heart, and that is how Jews use us to this day; any given industrial sector in the United States is full of immigrant/low IQ mutt shop workers, machinists, etc being carefully prodded and forced along by white middle management while Jewish and Indian executives at the top use the overall profits to push DEI messaging and other transnational agendas.

Christianity was a key weapon against slavery, just as it was against the Roman Empire, against the National Socialists, against essentially any non-Zionist element that currently exists in society today. It is a self fulfilling Jew created prophecy.

Even the Muslims realized Saul was a lying kike.

I try to add more Bitcoin units instead of selling to keep my purchasing power

I spend Bitcoin a couple times a week but not enough people accept it locally.

Public corporations have to put black men and white women in commercials, hire everyone but white men, shill Ukraine, homosexuals, BLM, etc. just to compete in an economy where liquidity is based on ESG DEI.

Then we embrace european colonialism with our heads held high, and turn Columbus day into Colonial Month, where all people of European descent are free from taxation / minor crimes. If it isn't allowed, then (((people))) will start dropping like flies. It baffles me that pussies on here will talk about how violent third worlders and niggers are, as if Europeans didn't have two world wars and the majority of all conflicts upon that soil. Hell, there are more sights of conflict on America than Africa. As of this point, I would try my hardest to set aside the gentle side we all have, and embrace the real, true humanity in us that wiped out the rest of the hominid classes. If even 10% of us became so hard core colonialist like China has become, it would cause a ripple and force DEI to rethink trying to cherry pick the past, as it is tainted, and rightfully so.

that's the best advice i can give you OP. some people are just losers. we live in an age where what previously would've been debilitating and caused selection is now celebrated. for example, glasses. as simple as glasses. being functionally blind would've drastically reduced your lifespan to such a degree that you likely wouldn't be able to pass on your poor eyesight. but now literally everyone is wearing glasses and contacts. this is a basic example, there are thousands more. some genes were meant to be dead ends to improve the overall quality of the species, but without selection, there is no improvement. from a universal standpoint, you're meant to improve the species through your failures, and that's something to be proud of. but the dei globohomo types have taken that from you. all you have left is being a loser.

There are simply too little of them, so expensive and can't even make them anymore, they are purely there to line someone's pockets. All actual equipment made for actually fighting wars was ditched in the 90s when the cold war ended, because western elites thought they'd won the game forever in 1991 and promptly sold everything off to their future enemies and went afk for 30 years

Good post ive seen in the previous thread.

I wish I saved the screenshot from the reddit escort page talking about how many women were retiring from escorting in 2024 because the business has dried up from how shitty the economy is.

No one basically has expendible money to fuck these women anymore. If they do, they aren't travelling. People don't want to deal with DEI hire pilots, Palestine protests at the airport, stepping over migrants to get out of the airport, being kicked out of your hotel because migrants got your room, etc.

So as a result women like Kagney who have hit the wall and gotten fat have no livelihood anymore. As 80% of America is living paycheck to paycheck the first thing they are going to cut out is the 8 dollar a month onlyfans subscriptions.

As a result we are seeing an uptick in porn suicides.

A relative of mine flies for DAL. Their CEO, Ed Bastion, is a woke DEI faggot. However, DAL loves hiring out of the military and therefore has a lot of good and highly experienced pilots. He told me United is ahead of the pack by far in DEI hiring and wokeness.

Jews are nuking "Amalek" ie what remains of White Christian civilization. Boeing has been utterly transformed in the race to the bottom of "profit max equation," importation of jeet program managers, and DEI as a driver for management bonuses. Besides Boeing going full retard, we have to be concerned with maintenance activities sliding towards disasters. If guys are not fairly compensate and are forced to operate with "at will employment" where faggot kikes can clear out workers at any time for any reason, White guys are going to find something else to do. As it is maintenance work can be grug work, and unlike other jobs, a real mistake can mean the deaths of many people. Given all these factors, my fear is that poor maintenance (along with anti-White policies regarding pilots, production, and ATC) can be the cause of an accident.

GDP is meaningless in that it does not accurately portray reality. As a statistic, it is an 'agreed upon fiction' rather than a real indicator. As such, it is horse shit. Whenever you find yourself in a situation where reality is important, horse shit becomes as valuable as... horse shit.

GDP fails at comparing internationally, and is unreliable. That much is obvious. It really does not have any purpose in terms of what it is advertised as doing. Its purpose is propaganda and perception management.

In an environment where you control the parameters of reality, ie you have a financial Empire with near monopoly influence, you can use something like GDP to rank winners and losers. It's not true, but you determine the rules so it doesn't matter. if you lose that dominant position, and other and/or real factors reassert themselves, four facade of GDP dissipates like fog. That is what is happening right now.

The problem in the US is that the Empire has fucked up its financial position which was the source of its power. It is now unwinding and the consequences are coming and inevitable. The primary one observable in the USA will be a dramatic drop-off in "wealth" for the class of people dependent upon Empire largesse. This is the tech sector, DEI, women's jobs, etc. The layoffs have already begun and that will dramatically escalate over the next two years.

The problem is that the financial situation of the domestic USA needs to be replaced because it can no longer utilize the Empire's financial system as it is going away. The process by which these systems are changed out is the Civil War.

The general consensus is that if there was incriminating Trump-Epstein stuff of any type it would have leaked already and been in every piece of media for months, as it is they've got a handful of pictures of them at the same cocktail party that are spammed ad nauseam. If Trump was involved actual journalism might have been applied, the guards might have been questioned, the warden, the camera operator, the FBI would have actually attempted to solve the murder if there was the slightest hint Trump had done it.

Trump also generally hasn't displayed the means or willingness to murder legal witnesses or rivals, in fact anyone who says anything about Trump is given a shitload of protection and financial reward regardless of how absurd it might be. The rest of Epstein's contacts on the other hand are a much more bloodthirsty bunch.

Finally the prison in question was largely a leftist run institution with a big fat black woman DEI hire as the warden, not exactly the kind of people that would take orders from or assist Trump.

Finally, Trump can't keep his mouth shut, if he killed Epstein he'd have bragged about it on social media.

The niggers are already here. There is exactly zero political will to genocide them or send them back to Africa. Why not teach them to be useful?

It doesn't have to be coding. There are literally a million different skills that we could teach them. Will they still fail en masse and end up on welfare? Yes. Just like how they are with reading now. But the benefit is that the few that do manage to make it end up in useful jobs. As it is now, we tell them if they learn to read, that there will be a job waiting for them. So the few that do graduate all end up manufactured DEI roles that we have to make up for them.

Wouldn't it be better to get some actual use out of them instead?

So the elites child fuckers come up with a catchy phase to articulate doing the work your wage reflects instead of trying to garner some bullshit corporate cudo's for doing excess work for free.

You don't pay. You don't get it. hourly fags learning how to think like contractors basically.

The only reason anyone in the public sphere is allowed to criticize DEI is because the bolshevik golems didn't line up behind israel, because they see them as white, thus have a metaphysical resentment of them.

Supporting liberal policies that unintentionally result in ethnic cleansing doesn't mean supporting every liberal policy. More money is going to the Ukraine thanks to progressives than is going to Reparations, but that doesn't do shit for white Americans. That said, you can easily blanket all-black neighborhoods with Planned Parenthood flyers, while blanketing all-white neighborhoods with anti-abortion options flyers. Using the left requires that kind of nuance. Overthrowing them entirely is best, but till then we need to co-opt them as best we can.
Also, do not underestimate the value of leftist policies in raising white consciousness. No white person who's lost his job to DEI or who's been forced to sit through one of their indoctrination session will fail to come out with the sort of intense anger and disgust that can easily lead to radicalization. That helps too, in the longer run.

No we can't. The sheer amount of overhead, DEI mandates, and apathetic alienated men eliminates any possibility of mass production in the USA. We can always import a lot of shitskins for the job, but that will only aggravate our social problems even more. A rod knocking engine will never run well again no matter how much fuel is in the tank and regardless of how much horsepower it produced out of the factory.

And the fact that many Chinese saboteurs have snuck through our open border furthermore guarantees that America will not mass produce anything even if it could. Imagine the carnage these bugs could create if they suddenly were ordered to sabotage the power grid in one major city.

>It’s hilarious looking back at how techbros were sneering at blue collar workers telling them to learn to code. How does it feel now numbnuts?
That was never "techbros," that was executives and grifters attempting to get people to learn to code to devalue the labor pool. Nothing executives hate more than "techbros" because at the end of the day they're peasants who demand more money than the executives because a) they are limited in number and in high demand along with b) vastly more intelligent than executives, who can't cope with their inferiority in anything.
AI is in fact a push to replace the "techbros" - but at the end of the day it doesn't comprehend an entire codebase and won't for awhile, so it writes horrible speghetti code full of bugs. In turn, the "techbros" who are put out of work by teams of DEI hires who can talk to chatgpt and string together speghetti are just going back to what they did as teenagers: hacking their former employers and bankrupting them for the crime of practicing DEI and being too incompetent to produce real code.

Ex-Boeing worker here. There's no single cause.

Yes, the McBoeing takeover resulted in McD style management (bean counters in charge) instead of old Boeing style management (engineers running the show).

Yes, the "DEI ALL THE THINGS!!!" bullshit is a problem because they are focused on hiring incompetents of the proper racial background rather than competent white guys.

But a lot of this stupid shit was baked in anyway. When I was there, on my second project, we had an entire group of at least sixty people, and probably a bunch more if you count tangential hangers-on, who sat around accomplishing almost nothing for an entire year because that's how the project was managed. I shit you not, the manager told us that he was proud of us for accomplishing, on average, about 48 hours towards our "statement of work" across the previous 2000-hour work year. The rest of the time was all overhead and sitting around bored as fuck talking to each other. It wasn't that we didn't care or didn't want to work, it was that we were forced to go through a process that was fundamentally dysfunctional, all in the name of getting everything right. Which of course wasn't going to happen anyway, because the stuff we were implementing was going to get revised dozens of times before actually becoming "production".

Moving work to Pooland actually HELPED in some ways because it meant that all the meddling managers couldn't fuck with things on a daily basis. The Poos were free to implement what had been specified instead of constantly being bounced around with daily changes based on nothing more than whims.

I worked in aviation for a decade and quit a few years back. One perspective I have is that the FAA used to be considered the gold standard and most other aviation authorities just rubber stamped FAA approvals. Now Boeing was in bed with the FAA in a big way because they’re American manufacturing and competing with Airbus, and this got to the point that the FAA was getting caught with their pants down repeatedly when it came to Boeing. EASA and Canada started getting more strict about doing their tests and kept finding really obvious shit. FAA started restructuring and reimplementing new plans but it’s a big ship and it’s hard to meaningfully change course especially when DEI frenzy is taking over

I last worked with FAA shortly before the 737 MAX happened and this was all before then.

Anyway, for Boeing specifically, there was a huge number of their engineers who got rich from cryptocurrency and quit. At least those were the rumors in engineering circles at the time. There was one guy who shilled it to all of his coworkers and it spread around and really gutted Boeing’s team

It's not a single thing, but many things.
Demographics are a part of it, although a lot less poo's than you'd expect. Used to be 95% white up here. Then people moved up for Boeing work due to moving incentives at other universities to increase their DEI, or because of the military bases in the area bringing up a bunch of mexicans and niggers.
Now it's -maybe- 60% and dropping fast.
There is a lot of laziness and criminal activity among the employees, and the union protects them. They're quite powerful and quite violent. People scabbing have had their homes and vehicles set on fire.
This is on top of just a lot of stupid decisions in general amongst the higher-ups, which then trickle down to management.

Because your shill image only works when the satellite is very close to the earth.
But because the earth takes up such as small amount space in the photo frame, it is clear that the satellite is very far away, and so your shill image does not apply to this situation.

Did the pirates and pastoralists who collapsed the Bronze Age palace societies and the internal proletariat who opposed the idiotic decadence of Bronze Age matriarchal communities fret and worry about having no future? Did they say, "oh, this civilization is collapsing, we have no future."

Fucking retard. This civilization surviving is preventing us from having a future. One day, DEI Cheka squads will show up at your front door in the middle of Nebraska or Wyoming and at gunpoint and using advanced DARPA crowd control technologies, kidnap your daughter to force her to cut her tits off. We are being hemmed in bit by bit, every single iota of natural life choked out of us. It's either collapse or we sacrifice thousands of years of history and destiny.

But either way, I have no doubt that it will collapse. It always will. It's the mandate of existence. Nothing is eternal, entropy takes all.

What's fucking crazy to me about windows today is pic rel.

You can tell by how garbage the UX is that departments must be hyper compartmentalized and the folks (shitskins, women, "women") who got into microsoft just don't give a single fuck about the product they are building. There's no real competition either so there's no reason for them to try.

This week I bought a cheap hp elitebook laptop. I started a clean win 11 install and after formatting the main drive, it could no longer connect to wifi (no bundled drivers). Since there's no ethernet port either thanks to the faggots at apple who had to make everything slim, it couldn't get past the "connect to wifi network" screen.

I had to open up a console, write a command and reboot just so that screen display "skip and continue as a guest account" type shit. Then onedrive is pre-configured so all your shit is synced to a measly 5gigs of space. It's a real shit show. I genuinely don't know how the average normie makes it today other than being a paypig to some garbage like geek squad.

Truthfully, I shit on the DEI but in reality even a lot of the decisions white men take nowadays don't make sense. Realistically if I was getting paid FAANG software dev money I wouldn't give a shit either. I would clock in a clock out and live my best life with the insane amount I am getting paid.

The best system would involve the college accepting the loan risk and doing the due diligence to determine the chances of the loan not being paid back. This would naturally filter out worthless degrees, and ensure only those going to college with actual future job prospects are permitted to take out loans. Note: this is already how the mortgage system works for housing.

Unfortunately, in our fucked up political system, this would be called out as racist, as the vast majority of student loans would go to whites and Asians. Basically the idea that everyone deserves a college education with undertones of DEI is and will continue fucking over US colleges.

They really don't, well the black ones do obviously, but people like Schumer and friends think it's just like where they come from, there's grift and graft but otherwise it's a normal government, they just assume blacks are poorer so the services aren't as good. Every dollar that goes into a black municipal budget is stolen, there is no clever attempt at money laundering or scheming, they literally just withdraw it in cash from city accounts, this is why black school districts have the highest per pupil spending in the country, and yet their buildings are literally falling apart, and they haven't bought a textbook since the 80s. This kind of thing is unfathomable to the white liberal, and even to the Jew, who knows to shave the coin not to just pocket the whole thing. It was at one point kept relatively in check by white liberals who acted as handlers of sorts, but those people were all purged in the Obama years, Rahm Emmanuel was basically the last gasp of that ilk. So we get to today, where big fat black women eat well on the public dollar and report 110% voter turnout and everyone's too terrified of being called racist to do anything about it. It's starting to happen at the federal level as the white boomers retire and the DEI people take over, DEI is basically code for hire the fattest black woman you can.

I did what society expected of me, chased the money and got a big boy office job, got a house. Guess what, this shit isn't fulfilling. Objectively it's good on paper, but when you come home to an empty house every day, wake up angry most mornings, you start to wonder about what's really important, and sitting in a cubicle for 8hrs pretending to work is at the bottom of the list.

I'm thinking I can do one more year of this, use the money to finish up my renovations, and then I'm out. Covid completely demoralized me once it became clear how expendable I was, doubly so with DEI and constant media bombardment of how bad I am, despite my net tax to public service usage being the main source of funding for their bullshit ideas.

Jews are rolling back DEI, leftist ideologues in the military, the tranny agenda, and generally shifting right. Theres no other excuse for this other than preparation for war. If jews had no external enemies they'd just quadruple down on anti-White policy and The Great Replacement. If Whites do infact win the war for Israel that's the reward that will await us.

feminist and DEI has convinced women that they can be presidents, managers, doctors, coders, pilots, drivers, etc.

If two candidates apply for the same role and one is a woman, the woman is getting the role 99.9% of the time. working women don't have time to raise kids

Ascoltatemi. Sono mezzo-terrone, perche dopo che i miei antenati se ne andrarono si sposarono coi bianchi veri e quindi sono letteralmente piu bianco di voi. Campanilismo e' esilarante per me perche nell'anglosfera e nell'Europa germanica tutti educati pensano che siate tutti marroni, cui siete, se qualcuno vedesse qualche padano borbottare sulla supremazia razziale dei """bianchi""" del nord Italia sui "terroni" poi ti riderebbe in faccia. I wignat online vi accettano solo perche pensano che abbiate tutti l'aspetto dei nordici e non sanno quanto siete bruni nella realta', perche' non sono mai stati li.

Abbiate un po' di rispetto per il vostro popolo, che include i terroni di cui condividete maggiormente la lingua e la cultura, invece di fare un pompino a Hans e Bjorn. Quando fate dei capelli biondi e degli occhi azzurri qualcosa da venerare, perdete tutti come nazione, perche tutti siete per lo piu privi di queste caratteristiche a parte gli austriaci che non si considerano nemmeno parte della vostra nazione. E' come se un adolescente alla disperata ricerca di accettazione, che e' alto 1,65m, prendesse in giro qualcuno di 1,60m perche e' nano quando tutti gli altri a scuola sono alti piu' di 1,80...

Se si volete salvare l'Italia da sciami dei negri, i terroni e i polentoni devono mettere da parte questa follia nordicisma. Cercare di ingraziarsi un'ideologia che non ha piu alcun potere nel mondo (il suprematismo nordica/germanica) da quasi un secolo fa? Non ha senso o futuro.

Her mind is full of the best fucks she's had and the times she had BBC. You act like she doesn't have her own memories and isn't a person.

The real headline in this article is that a woman thinks it's liberating to "stick it to the man" by becoming a full time whore when she worked hard to get her corporate job and likely benefited from DEI to get it. Then she was given a choice to become a whore or keep her corporate job and she chose the oldest profession for women. It's the same shit when women complain about being objectified while trying to seek attention of social media with their bodies. Hypocrisy.

It is not really DEI if they are not even in your country yet.
Even the minorities had a better place to live before being swarmed by illegals and thier children.
Minorities want to live and work white adjacent not have thier own place they are the majority in.
They measure success in having a professional job with white coworkers, white spouse, and live in a white neighborhood. A beautiful life.
Whites are a magnet to others, and they then try to keep fleeing to new areas to still live in a white community. Until none are left.

I stayed at a 4-star hotel recently in the downtown area of a major city. It was filled with niggers. You could smell weed in the hall. You could hear whooping and chimp calls all through the night.

I chose that hotel specifically to avoid niggers, because I thought it would price them out. They were staying there just as a party place because it has a pool and is close to downtown clubs. It's the same thing at nice restaurants. Go to any $100 plate steakhouse. It will be filled with niggers.

Niggers have endless money. Sure, not ever black person is making $600k, but it only takes one DEI sheboon making 6 figures to pay for an entire entourage of niggers to live it up at a hotel, restaurant or miami beach.

This would be a huge surprise if it was the 90s. However DEI has ruined education and has allowed people who should never have gotten a degree to graduate and be put in positions they are completely unqualified for. We are just now seeing this with an ever increasing competency crisis across every industry. So the reality is they were given a degree to make them feel superior and all this did was inflate their ego and elevate them above their ability.

You're wrong. A few years ago, Indians here used to be mostly decent. Now, there's too much riff raff here. Indians are incredibly territorial and are probably one of the biggest chest-thumpers out there. They simply can not let anything be better than themself and they organize into groups with the sole intent of taking down people better than them by any means possible. Fortunately, they don't trust each other and are extremely paranoid and corrupt. Their groups implode often and they are pretty stupid to boot.

It's not just DEI, it's the lack of people that can actually get shit done. Whites aren't free of blame either, they have also gone to great lengths to discredit and deceive their geniuses. The only reason White civilization works is because their NPCs have the great mimetic abilities.
And yes, a mono-ethnic society helps but genetic quality matters much, much more.

I would argue that having a mono-ethnic society really helps with all of the points you discussed. DEI is a death sentence to ingenuity, creativity, and actual advancement due to language barriers, cultural differences, thought pattern differences, and mean (statistics, not demeanor) behaviors of the people that DEI shoehorns into positions they could never get with merit. When a group of people collaborate to achieve a goal and they all speak the same language, think similarly, understand each other's behavior and culture, it stands a much higher chance of being successful. IQ Standard deviations also contribute greatly to this.

I've got excellent work ethic. From my teenager years when I first started working all through my 20s I'd go years without taking a single sick day if i didnt actually have to take one and I'd plan any doctors visits around my days off, I'd pick up slack and work extra, and sometimes just cash out vacation time rather than taking it if it's an option. I'm possesed of that legendary protestant work ethic which borders on unhealthy compulsion riddled with guilt and shame if i for a moment fail to live up to my standards for myself there. What i don't have however is loyalty to a company that has no loyalty to me and I will not stick around for more than those couple years in a place where those qualities are not recognized and rewarded. Then I'll fuck around for a several months pursuing my hobbies to develop the skills i actually want to have and pay my immediate bills hustling up gigs there as best i can before eventually taking a gamble on another corporate job for the stability hoping hard work will actually be rewarded there. Occasionally I've found a place like that but inevitably a merger or corporate buy out happens eventually, management gets all shaken up, bennies get fucked, and the things that made it worth working for die with the old company so i leave there too. In my 30s now. As the years have dragged on the breaks between those sort of jobs are getting longer, the gigs are paying more, are more frequent as I learn more, and the stability of a traditional 9-5 increasingly less valuable in the face of all the nepotistic, dei, corrupt corporate politics bullshit.

>Leave aside the green investment pledges. Look at what Keir Starmer has never wavered on. His constitutional reforms, drawn up by Gordon Brown in ‘A New Britain‘, will give the law courts broad new powers to strike down legislation; will create a ‘rights package’ (including welfare payments to migrants) that is to be put beyond the power of Parliament to abridge; and will give Whitehall a statutory existence – meaning it will become virtually impossible to reform its workings or fire any of its personnel. Starmer will complete the process of franchising out democratic governance to independent watchdogs: energy policy will go to ‘Great British Energy’; low-level offences to ‘community payback boards’; much of the budget to an ‘Office for Value for Money’; and what remains of Westminster health policy to an ‘NHS mission delivery board’. The planned Race Equality Act will tighten existing equalities legislation, which already does so much to constrain elected Governments, and which has created what we now recognise as the DEI bureaucracy. It will further entrench the programme of state multiculturalism from which there is a direct line to the atrocities in Rotherham, Telford and Rochford. Outlets like GB News will almost certainly find themselves censored by a beefed-up Ofcom: Welsh Labour has banned the channel from the Senedd, and worthies like Adam Boulton have already called for such a course.
>Every time a public figure has traded in this feeling over the past 25 years – every call to ban journalists from following celebrities or Royals around; every proposal to stop treating the issues of the day as ‘political footballs’ and outsource them to an unelected watchdog; every peal against ‘divisiveness’ – they have fed into the vulgar anti-politics that now finds its final expression in Starmerism.

Not dissimilar from the DEI requirements in the modern west. Try being an actual Christian advocating for Christian politics or just stating your opposition to the replacement of White people and you'll encounter the same kind of repression at least in Australia.
Not to defend the Soviet Union's policy on the matter, simply to point out that such criticism would also apply to the modern West.

>Brother, you are talking to a person who lived in those cities at the tail after fall of USSR. Jews consistently used to make up 30% of the population of Odessa for example, until they started to diffuse into population and become Ukrainian or Russian on census data but one generation back still Jewish. It is same way that Prigojin was, currently in Russia he was recorded as ethnic Russian, but his Grandfather USSR ID says Jew.
Also people have a strange fascination with Stalin and him being some kind of based anti-Jew, he married a Jew.

If they're abandoning their identity as Jews then that's still a far more successful policy than modern atheist Jews in the west who still identify as Jewish. I have zero counter arguments to your claim that they didn't leave or die and instead just changed how they answered identification forms because I can't prove that you're wrong.

The risk-reward is preferable to the people doing this because:
(1) In nearly all US institutions, getting more black people into the field is the #1 management priority and
(2) Most state DAs - not just the DEI hires but espectially the DEI hires - have been groomed for that role for decades. They are there to do the dirty work while masking their master's fingerprints. You don't want someone too smart or ambitions in this role for obvious reasons.

Imam Anwar Al-Awlaki said in one of his lectures. In Israel and USA they prescribed so much anti depressants to a massive percentage of the population that they couldn't produce enough anti depressants. In USA instead of changing the world and the circumstances that cause people to be depressed their solution is to pump everyone full of anti depressants. I would say the world has turned to shit but that's only partially true, the world has been shit for a long time. Where I live I go out and it's like being in a ghost town. Nobody talking to each other, nobody laughing or smiling or cutting up with laughter just a horde of zombie-npcs. The corrupt political system in USA polluted by the George Soros PAC has been promoting the you will have nothing and be happy and the bullshit globalist agenda for decades. Globalism is a curse for Americans. Making the global standard the same as an American is impossible, there are not enough resources. The only thing globalism does is take away from 1st world citizens and Americans to give the money to 3rd world people. Globalism is the cause of all our problems and the Psychiatric reprisals and weaponized psychiatric care is only one of their tools. If you speak out or make a stand about ANYTHING on the Globalist DEI agenda you will be persecuted and ostracized until you break and either remain silent or die slowly in a prison or mental hospital.

I spent a lot of time in that industry. She was hired because of her dad's name AND her cunt. Every single woman in that industry is incompetent but walks around blithering about being "a woman in film". The entire industry cucks to them. Everyone gaslights them into thinking they're not retards. Anyone who doesn't doesn't get hired. I wouldn't be surprised if Baldwin got some DEI $$$ for having a cunt in the armor's chair and that being a significant reason why they've been shielding her so much.

That made me chuckle, but no, seeing how the world is getting fucked by them in all areas and they have been rotting the mind and poisonning the world through Blackrock , Vanguard, DEI , forced diversity quotas, gender "Butler" theory, yada yada yada, using Putin through theyr Chabad hassidic orthodoxy to kill caucasians / whites...

You need to fuck off, or if you are normal everyday jews with decent fucking moral values, start to denounce what the obvious Ziosatanist like Netanyahu, Less Wexxner and that whole rotten branch of yours are, for what they really are.

You seem to pretend to know it but never speak out against it, so until you show some good will and say something instead of hiding while it all happens because it might benefit you in the long run cauz you are part of the jewish diaspora, you have no bravery, you are a coward just waiting to see what happens and in any case you have no dog in this race as you will end up on the other side unscathed while everybody else will be fucked.

It's the easiest position for you as you can just relax and cross your arms behind your head, spread your toes and see it all happen from the safety of your overly protected ethnic group.

>An upgraded f22 would have been fine.
Yes, but the pentagon (which is run by leftist retards) made the decision that they wanted 1 plane for ALL combat situations. A fighter to replace the F16, F15, F18, F22. A bomber and close air support to replace the A10 and Harrier with VTOL capabilities. And this aircraft must be usable for ALL branches. While on paper it is an ambitious idea and possible achievable goal, in practicality, there is too much being asked of the plane and the engineers who have to try to make it happen. Then LMCO gets a new CEO that is a woman during this time and starts focusing on DEI bullshit in combination with government. The government then continues to push for more and more capabilities and requirements.

I actually fault the government in this entire endeavor. But I will use this to make myself money.

The article is actually an attempt at ridiculing those who oppose their affirmative action, and gaslighting at the same time, by telling us that somehow we are supposed to think men are privileged since a college gave them promotional stickers or hats one time. Meanwhile, women universally get 70% scholarships or free rides for doing nothing. This article is like a calculated slap in the face, both mocking and yet reinforcing the narrative, while simultaneously keeping up the endless drumbeat narrative that we're supposed to act like there is a bias in the opposite way from what it really is and that they're truly never going to stop saying it. They will always be saying everyone is racist, etc. no matter what anyone does.

What this is is just more constant lies from the DEI hires. All of it is intended to be demoralizing by how it never stops because they control media and keep forcing you and everyone around you to keep reading their poor quality propaganda articles. They just keep finding ways to claim that they are being oppressed even when they clearly aren't and everyone knows it's a lie but people are being forced to say nothing against it and accept it, or else they immediately screech and try to get you cancelled, and of course, the world never seems to give any bad consequence to woke liars for trying to get someone cancelled. It's only positive attention lavished to the woke liar, feeding them lies to inflate their ego. Until they're such insufferable grotesque beasts that you find working at a cash register that no one can stand to even see the sight of them and would prefer for their mental sanity to just pretend they don't exist.

And you could do that with 0% interest rates. But now interest rates are higher, and even with Jewish accounting companies like Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount are getting eaten alive servicing debt with no significant cash inflow.

I legitimately wouldn't be surprised if the film industry at some point has to pull a 2008 auto industry and come to the feds for a bailout.

Depends on the population sizes and race. The larger the population size, the more "intelligent" people you're going to have compared to a small population size (this is evident in stratification). Now when you consider race as well, the high end intelligence of the black population is like an average white person. Forcing DEI therefore isn't based on merit, because merit based hiring would reflect the population stratifications accurately.

In school they're getting more attention from teachers and more funding for their extracurricular programs.
In college they're getting preferential treatment towards acceptance into the college, acceptance into scholarships and internships, acceptance into hyper competitive programs, etc.
In employment, they get preferential treatment due to DEI mandates.

Your children will be indoctrinated into woke and LGBTQ ideology from a very young age, raised by homos, lesbos, trannies and queers. They'll pass laws to take your children away if you don't want to let them become trans, while psychologists will be legally obliged to agree with any delusion a patient may have (actual laws in multiple Western countries). You'll be taxed to no end, to pay for the migrants, for DEI struggle sessions, to fight climate change, and to pay for the wars. You'll be forced to eat ze bugs and live in pods, eventually. All your leaders will be globalist shills who despise you, because you are a pround people, with your own identity, your own personality - traits these traitors do not possess and are envious of. They'll spit in your face as they arrange for you to be bred out of existence; If you object, you will be imprisoned for spreading "hate" or some other nonsense. If you want to remain a Ukrainian, if you want to keep Ukraine Ukrainian, you'll be labeled a "far right extremist" and denied participation in government. You'll have a semblance of democracy, but you'll have nothing to say.

The West is becoming very similar to living under a dictatorship.

So, despite what you may think, this war is really not about your freedom - It's about choosing the yoke you will suffer under.

At least, you have a choice. For us Westerners, the choice has already been made.

Of course, Putin will use actual violence to keep you under his yoke, while here in the West, it's mostly intimidation, legal procedure, media pressure -- the "soft" approach to killing.

Not sure if it was simply that they got tired of arguing with a sperg.
Or if they got tired of "accidentally" getting my cane and cart bumping into their heads and torsos.
Or if they realized that yelling at a cripple during a "die in" is bad for PR reasons- since dead people usually don't start yelling and spazzing out, jolting upright, or arguing with cripples that they're inconveniencing with fellow wokees filming them for updoots.

I seriously gotta give it to Daisy. Her glowie dad coaching her on all the anti-trump shit, all the commie anti-gun shit, etc., truly made Daisy the gun salesman of the year. Sales spiked like fuck after every time she spoke or was in the news. Partly due to floridians thinking guns might be harder to buy soon, partly out of spite, and partly by libtards that saw his security detail all packing massive heat and wanted protection that was good enough for Daisy's standards- seeing as how his glowie dad helped orchestrate/plan his security detail

Hey I have a MSc in chemistry too, but I was born in America and went to an American college for a 4 year degree first, then an American university to get my masters. This degree was worth a lot more before the show breaking bad came out (increased popularity of the profession coupled with foreign worker visas) There are chemical production labs that have >70% workers over 50, years old, some in their 70s making over $200k playing with chemicals in their hoods. Masters degree got you in at ~$60k to start out, you’d never reach $200k as a bench chemist now, but the old timers got their degrees and jobs at the right time (also phd programs used to take 3 years instead of 5-6, and masters used to take 1 year instead of 2-3).
They just started offering less money to chemists because foreigners were doing the job relatively worse but ultimately for less money so net better for the business (due to DEI/staff quota bonuses from influential investors like blackrock). Make your home country great please, chemistry degrees can pivot wellinto production, engineering or r&d jobs to maximize your potential

Med school professor here so I'm deep in the DEI hornet's nest. The truth is that high-competence professions have a really nasty combination:
>ideologically-driven ultra-lefties who view "underrepresentation" of minorities (i.e., less than majority-minority) and women (i.e., literally any men at all) as a mortal, generational sin that must be corrected at all costs
>jobs too hard for minorities to do (wignats and radical blue-haired lefties agree on this, which is hilarious, they just disagree on why it's true), and many of which are too technical for even smart women to have interest in
They NEED their numbers to go up. Literally every faculty and university meeting I'm in (top 20 med school) the school, department, etc. states that its MISSION is to increase representation. This is what you need to get through your skulls:
THE PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS TO INCREASE REPRESENTATION OF "DISADVANTAGED" GROUPS
>THE PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS TO INCREASE REPRESENTATION OF "DISADVANTAGED" GROUPS
THE PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS TO INCREASE REPRESENTATION OF "DISADVANTAGED" GROUPS
>THE PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS TO INCREASE REPRESENTATION OF "DISADVANTAGED" GROUPS
THIS IS WHY THEY EXIST. THIS IS THEIR STATED OBJECTIVE.
Given that, who gives a fuck if people show up date, or can't do their jobs well? It's only a problem when someone fucks up so bad (e.g., Claudine Gay) that they absolutely need to get fired. And that's only a problem because it messes with the representation numbers. That's literally it. The people at the top don't care about science, medicine, health, education, etc. That's not the goal anymore. The goal is representation, to get people with certain characteristics into roles they otherwise wouldn't go into, at all costs.

Now you know.

The point that I was making about DEI is that the identity group itself isn't the biggest problem from it. Obviously it's a problem if you are expected to share close quarters and take showers with a homosexual.

The biggest problem with DEI is not that they are tolerated, it is that they are rewarded for it. Merely tolerating them would be less of an issue than rewarding them.

If a unit has a homosexual cannibal as it's CO, a lot of guys might find that fucked up, but if they hear the reason he got the job is because he's saved the lives of every man there multiple times, it becomes a lot more acceptable. "Yeah, he's an insane faggot, but he's also a serial killer that is really good at it. One time the enemy had us completely pinned down. We were all going to die. But he charged their position, by himself, completely naked except for his ammo belt. And then he raped them. And them he ate them raw while they were still alive screaming. He's a deranged faggot, but he's our deranged faggot."

True story from I guy I know from the 101st. They were doing drills with the South Korean army. His drill instructor was a fat black woman who got heat exhaustion in the middle of it and had to sit under a tree and be fanned. He said he had to hold back his tears. He'd never been so embarrassed, as the ROK soldiers watched a supposedly "elite" unit collapse from marching across the parking lot.

When the DEI candidate knows they are guaranteed promotions and medals even if they are incompetent cowards, they aren't "all they can be" because they know their efforts are wasted, they will get it anyway. When the white male sees this and discovers he can never be promoted or awarded no matter how hard he tries, he stops trying.

Just having them there is damaging to morale, but actively rewarding soldiers on that basis alone is far, far worse.

The potential harm is participating in a fake system, then potentially receiving fake results that the masses interpret as real. What is the actual change when Trump wins? White skinned non-jews will still be the bottom caste of your society. You will still be harassed and fired for not going along with every DEI doctrine your company enforces. The BLM niggers can still potentially rampage all over your cities if something ticks them off, without any repercussions for their actions. Your money will still be worthless and inflating to high heavens. But it's all fine, you see: the red candidate can win and all will be right.
The ability to choose a lesser evil is effectively a pacifier against fighting and toppling evil.
You are not wrong on one observation though: currently the red candidate is the lesser evil. So, if you MUST vote, vote for that. Just know that you are engaging in a shared delusion, constructed specifically so that the boot has less drag while it approaches your face.

>And I want real reasons
The analysis is broken down into two parts: #1 why do men join the military in the first place? #2 how are these conditions not being met?

1 Honor and Glory. The main reason men join is for honor and glory, in social status. The concept that when a medal winner returns home he is greeted with a ticker-tape parade, different companies compete to hire him, and women beg for his affections. This used to be the case. I'm old enough to remember WWII vets that were still wearing their uniforms and medals to the grocery store at 80 years old because it made them a rock-star to that generation. My uncle won the silver star for bravery twice, and when he showed up it was like Elvis or Taylor Swift or someone walked in. Those men expected that kind of treatment, because that was how Civil War vets were treated in their time.Their 5% discount at Lowes aside, they are not treated like that anymore. Tearing down statues from that era effects them to a degree, but what really effects them is seeing Vietnam vets spit on and called baby killer and nooticing that every power broker, Biden and Trump both, were all draft dodgers. This can not be fixed overnight because it takes a generation or so to build a martial culture that respects vets. And no, saying "thank you for your service" to a homeless vet just doesn't cut it.

2 Treatment while in the service. Military service tends to run in families and you can be very sure young men thinking of joining ask their veteran relatives what they can expect. Vaccine mandates hurt the services a lot. Imagine being a ten year veteran of the Navy Seals, risking torture and death, and then recieving a dishonorable discharge!

DEI hurts this, but not because "fags can't fight" or something. It's because promoting people based on anything other that combat efficiency discourages everyone from working hard when they clearly see that your promotion is guaranteed.

Now here is the problem: The WFH kaizen is more efficient, the costs cut from WFH are great, and finally the labor pull is greatly enhanced.

RTO is doomed to fail, and that will trigger what the kikes fear: market correction.

Very few goyim Whites are at the top of the food chain. Even beaners now have wealthy and prestigious jobs due to affirmative action and DEI, and the HR managers being their fellow shitskins. Most of the homeless in California are White people. Jews and Asians are at the top, beaners next, then niggers, then goyim Whites at the very bottom. lol They’re completely disenfranchised.

I can't believe you actually, heh, WORK. Fucking losers. Check this brilliant get rich scheme. See, instead of going to work what I do is that every day I just sit out at an intersection with a sign. You won't believe it, people literally just GIVE YOU MONEY! I pay for so much shit like this, it's unreal! To keep expenses down and make sure my income is going as far as it can, I don't even have a house. What, you expect me actually pay someone else to live in my own home? Home "owners" are just renters with extra debt. So I just cut the middle man out. I bought myself a tent and sleep in that. It's great! It's small, it's portable, it protects me from the elements. What more do I need?

Don't even have a car either. You think I'm going to pay Shekelstein and Bergowitz's insurance fees? You think I'm actually going to pay the Saudis for oil to power my jew cruiser? Fat chance. No, I got myself a mountain bike and a wagon. I can haul the stuff I need if I ever need to move around which is all the time because I've got wanderlust and don't like to stay in one place too long. And there's clothes. I don't buy clothes because I know it's just going into some woke DEI shit, you're not going to fool me. I wear the same clothes for a week straight and, good tip, doing this makes people more inclined to give you money. Guess they really respect my resolve. If I need new clothes, there's all these places that'll just give you them for free!

So go and "work" for your wages, cucks. I'll enjoy true freedom the likes of which not even NEETs will be able to dream of.

So when shit starts to get slightly tough, shit that our later 70's, early 1980's frens would have dreamt about, our little snowflakes have mental breakdowns for. Like having to work to get a paycheck, or being told no for some stupid shit, or not winning, when you lose.

Zoomers didn't and don't work high school jobs, stuff like fast food has been taken over by blacks and immigrants and malls are all collapsing. So they learn no work ethic. They also have been coddled their whole lives by their parents, the school system, then the college, and expect their employer to be their new dad. They also have some weirdly inflated sense of themselves, even worse than millennials, probably because of social media, and they expect to get 2 promotions a year by doing no work. They also put labels on all the shit that they do even though it is hilariously shit that everyone has done, sometimes for thousands of years ("silent walking" - the act of walking around without your headphones on).

I think they'll figure it out, and as usual the most intelligent and most driven ones will be fine. At my company, I've seen plenty of zoomers and while we have gotten more bad hires than in the past (probably because of dei initiatives), the best ones are just as good as anyone else.

DEI is going to exacerbate societal decay. But there'd be decay even without DEI.
Average IQ in western regions is dropping. Dumbest people are the ones having the most children. Plus immigration from retard-tier regions.

I don't think people understand the severity of the situation. Even basic services that employ 100 IQ people will become borderline dysfunctional when you employ a legion of 90 IQ people. Sectors that require higher intelligence and more careful maintenance will suffer even more - the public will actually be in danger.
DEI is going to accelerate the process and bring forth a version of clown world so ridiculous it'll make the current one seem like a light joke. Now that they're not even pretending to hire based on merit, it's fucking over.

For your safety and the continuation of society as you know it you better hope we achieve agi soon so that workers can be replaced with machines. Otherwise the entirety of the west is bound to become an unlivable shithole.

Obviously, DEI is a legalese backdoor to push communist style ethnic warfare in mainstream institutions. That should be obvious to anyone who isn’t an idiot. Too bad for Americans, they don’t get a choice. The law is not only designed such that employers can use legalese to push this shit it on you, they also have civil rights and title ix law which deprives you of legal recourse. Civil rights law practically enshrined ethnic minorities as a quasi-aristocracy in this country.

Most normies do. They actually recoil from it after being conditioned by it for so long. Maybe lately the trajectory is downward because everything is racist now, so it's becoming more meaningless.

I get that a "good DEI score" (whatever thay means) can give you access to borrow more money, BUT THAT ISN'T AN ASSET! Borrowing more debt with no plan on how to pay it back just means it's you are upping your liabilities.
I don't know if this is some grand corporate move I don't understand, if they are purposely trying to collapse companies, or if these insane retards who are running this legit believe it.

The diversity meme worked in the 80s because it removed a barrier for finding the best talent.
Now it's just lost it's mind and become a weird hivemind of causes that make no sense.
Example, why are black and brown people or UKRAINE on these updated gay pride flags? WTF DOES BEING BLACK, BROWN, OR UKRAINIAN HAVE TO DO WITH BUTT SEX?

I don't understand how DEI isn't illegal due to a conflict with the fiduciary duties of a CEO.
I work construction. A good paying union one not a rinky dink scam one.
I shit you not, we hired a 60 year old black woman who picks fights with the rest of the crew then cries victim. She comes to work in outfits that have no use in construction. Sometimes she just doesn't show up cause she doesn't feel like it. She has 0 experience and does everything to not work. She tries to shill her self published books and larps online as an entrepreneur because she'll speak at any conference and sell her shitty book out of the trunk of her car. The only saving grace is she is still technically in the probation period.

Our foreman can't write her up. He has to have serious talks with us each time she throws a tantrum because someone asked her to do something.
If any guy were to complain to HR, the guy would be investigated. If she complains, the guy is investigated.

I scored on some McKinsey survey the company had as a "Most trusted" person and they asked me to be a "agent of change". The moment I heard the first meeting I told my foreman to have me removed from the program. It was vague retarded shit ran by women who refuse to listen to anyone but their feel good corporate affirmations and tell us they want us to spread their pointless unclear propaganda even when not at work, and continually tell us we "Opted in" to the program.
No I didn't. You told me to show up and didn't tell me anything. Eat shit. If this is where we are going we deserve to fail.

Wanna know the funny part?

Anti White DEI programs, replacement, destruction of small communities. Losing our independence etc. The Jews and the fringe left create flammatory issues that have little or no impact on our lives. The major issues that impact us are usually labeled under terms like"systemic racism". It's their video for taking down systems that protect us.

We need to elevate /our/ people to replace foreign DEI pushers in admin, and fire and or deport the hostile student and faculty after sterilizing them or something. These foreign subversives quite literally think it's funny to destroy our nation from inside out, and most of the anti-White and anti-American measures are coming straight from our universities and compromised federal government workforce diversity hires.
Even if 70% of our higher education faculty and admin are still White Americans, it won't last long if they keep trying to play global university degree mill plantations instead of being American institutions first and foremost.

Former public school teacher here. You don't need to go after teachers. Go after admin at all levels: school, district, board, and superintendent (including state super). All publicly elected positions are compromised and leftist grooming is coming from the top down.

Replacing DEI and leftist teachers in public schools is a must. They can find better jobs at call centers or something, I really don't care.
It's urgent that public education brings back a sense of mission and togetherness, including competitive spirit and striving for excellence. Weakness cannot be tolerated.
This is only possible when people are sure the government and the system has their back on the most fundemental level of maslow's hierarchy of needs, and that requires mass deportations first and foremost.
At the same time, replacing insecure and possibly schizophrenic and dysgenic educators with people who encourage excellence, not continuing unhealthy babyboomer regret filled type of education that keeps beating down on anything that they can't do, etc.
It's really all about the counter soviet agitation efforts during the cold war that screwed up people's priorities. People literally don't know how to excel, only to maintain status quo. This unhealthy, defensive, and coping mentality need to stop.

A lot of somber pall all around the whole region. Way too many diversity hires also. They are completely fucking up the whole DMV region with insane copes and are quite literally just devolving everything down to third world level. It's nothing short of civilizational suicide.
>Keep re-centering everything to midwit levels
K-12 is failing nationwide because of DEI and diversity. AP scores are going down like a sinking rock because these idiots haven't learned a thing. Entry level college undergrads are basically highschool freshmen. The sense of mission and devotion to excellence has been completely replaced with need to maintain social order and play nice to the lowest denominator, and now comes the scapegoating, although it may be warranted. There are just too many hostiles and degenerate foreign subversives hell bent on harming America or die trying.
We need a massive injection of fresh faces in the DC area federal workforce and maybe enough labor replacement population to make up for forthcoming deportations. These people are committing kollektive civilizational suicide at such a frightening pace, it's mind boggling.

Homeschooling is generally fine on a personal level, but it's not a realistic solution at a societal level. Especially when most of the people suggesting it would be the first to shit a brick if we implemented social programs for Whites that allowed them to be one income families. It definitely is another form of escapist innawoods/just move another exit down the interstate cope until the shitskins end up there too tier cope though. Like what are you gonna do when your kids get inundated with fag, tranny, and DEI shit for the first time in young adulthood? That's how we ended up where we're at. The public schools hadn't yet been completely pozzed and kids got exposed to that shit for the first time in college and just lost it. Sending them to public school and correcting the record so to speak of what they're taught probably doesn't yield bad outcomes at all.

If you dont get accepted, you get expelled or fail under some pretense like failing a group project.

Britain’s armed forces have consistently failed to hit recruitment targets and are looking overseas to boost ethnic minority representation, which currently stands at 14 per cent of the regular army.

A document leaked to this paper, titled The British Army’s Race Action Plan, notes that the Army “struggles to attract talent from ethnic minority backgrounds into the officer corps”.

Published in March 2023 and understood to be the latest guidance, it outlines a series of “actions” to boost representation and describes security clearance vetting as being “the primary barrier to non-UK personnel gaining a commission in the Army”.

It vows to “challenge SC [security clearance] requirements” to boost representation in the intelligence and officer corps, positions which have “uncontrolled access to secret assets”.

People from Commonwealth countries can serve in the British Army, however, the race plan notes that “There are only 131 [serving] non-UK regular officers” of which “28 were recorded as an ethnic minority” with the rest being white Irish or white Commonwealth.

Sir Richard Dearlove, who served as the head of MI6 between 1999 and 2004, said: “The evidence published today in The Telegraph, which apparently prioritises diversity, equality, and inclusion in matters of national security, is very worrying indeed. Effective security policies at whatever level they are applied simply do not allow for ‘politically correct’ soft edges.

“The fighting capability of our armed forces, already hollowed out as the Defence Select Committee recently documented, must not be further compromised by the over-application of DEI ideology. We are living in a world where the threat of war is getting closer.

“We give succour to our enemies if the concentration on the creation of an effective warrior mentality is not the primary objective of our navy, army and airforce.”

Mao cannot work in India. The situation is permanently hopeless. You have dozens of states, many of them large enough to be countries in their own right, forced to work under one national banner. Add democracy to the mix and you have politicians pandering hard with gibs to outcompete their rivals in consolidating their vote banks. Mutts joke about Indians being insulated trad women beaters but we had our own equivalent of DEI and gynocentric laws long before current year. Here's a short summary of the reasons why it sucks to have mini nation states work under one banner.
>practically every region/cluster of states has its own take on Hinduism so there's no way to nationally regulate it to prune the retarded practices out
>resource allocation becomes a joke because the government gets direct taxes by 2-5% of the total population and it all disappears in corruption or gets funneled into gibs packages for election season
>states with comparatively better resources and headstart get dragged down by labor migration and regional displacement (every state bitches about it)
I could easily add another hundred unique points to this, I can see the mess so clearly it's absolutely joever. It doesn't matter though, even if each state was 100% autonomous and independent it would simply result in more hostility and warlord politics by the more aggressive states. And of course, much much more foreign interference by powerful bigger nations like China debt trapping states one by one. It's so beautifully fucked, not even the whitest man alive can reason a solution for the Indian question without resorting to genocide and chemical castration.

Economics is a weird issue for WA state level politics because we've got everything from farms and timber to airliners and naval shipyards to Amazon and Microsoft, so the main way to boost economic input is to cut down on the dumb lefty culturewar shit, taxes, and regulations to let our existing economic engines rev up.

Wrong, you just picked the wrong direction. Run an ad about how the liberals and globalists are pushing tranny shit to dupe kids into sterilizing themselves, preying on women's desire for attention by being "the mom with a trans kid," and stealing children from their fathers. Put out a commercial about how the courts are set up to fuck over men in the name of "protecting women" in various ways when the reality is it's just a power grab by the state to take the role of men for 90% of the money they would have given to loyal women to begin with if not for whore culture. Make a commercial about how whites are being replaced with DEI and other initiatives by indian scam artists pushing the shit after worming their way into positions of power. In short: do SOMETHING with the wealth people have entrusted you with which actually preserves culture and white people instead of pandering/insulting and destroying them. It's not fucking rocket science.

I was in school at the time. They interrupted class to turn on the news because it was clear something was going down that wasn't just a plane crash. So we watched it live. When the second plane came in, I remember thinking "oh, did they find footage of the [first] plane hitting?" but then I saw the other tower was already smoking. That's when it dawned on me that it was a second plane. Wildest fucking shit I had ever seen in my life, especially with it being live.

The kids on social media who piss and moan about J6 being another 9/11 don't know shit about what 9/11 was to our society at the time. J6 was just a dumb riot, we saw worse during the Floyd riots already. America has never recovered from 9/11. I know it's a meme to say "9/11 changed everything" but it really did. It led to a 20 year war, it led to the Patriot act (that has been the real cancer on america since then), it led to a new wave of political correctness ("not all muslims!") that eventually gave us DEI, it intensified the divide between the right and left thank to what Bush did afterwards, it really was the inflection point of the decline of the country since then.

The correct solution, for any nation, is to take their smartest and brightest, whom are also not corrupt, and promote them within institutions and private industry. All pajeets will be untermenschen, and the ones which are ubermenschen can get honorary status, and slowly integrate into the ubermenschen class. Ubermenschen have a responsibility.

Why do you think they bring in DEI? To fuck over the natural process and bring 110iq untermenschen to rule over everyone.

remote work has two outcomes depending on the worker's quality

productivity either goes up dramatically with an equal rise in well-being or productivity nosedives

the only reason offices exist at all is as an attempt to corral the DEI hires and make them productive enough to at least be worth employing them at all.

I had no idea that this was the ultimate purpose until my company built a new office and I realized that everyone who was forced to commute were the lowest performers

most companies would be so much more productive without the lower 30% of employees it isn't even funny. which is why all the tech companies have been doing layoffs, they are always the leading edge of the trend because they are most affected by high interest rates

Also portland. Also noticed the biggest problem in the world is not minorities, jews, asians and so on. Biggest destroyer of society is middle aged white liberal women and their faggot simp cuckold husbands. Without fail these retards vote for unlimited taxes unlimited dei agenda unlimited socialism unlimited everything bad, they give money to junkies for drugs they think the homeless pronlem can be solved by just giving homeless money, thry have very little to no understanding how dangerous the city actually is, they are the biggest driver of bias crime reporting and other things which rot society. They live in 800k+ homes in whiter than albino neighborhoods and they have those "in our ameroca..." signs up by the tens in their front yards. They put the jewish flag on their porch next to a palestinian flag next to a lgbt flag and they park all over the fucking road even though they have a driveway and garage.

You can gaurantee they will always vote for the most dei candidate without regard to policy and make things worse each year. Im sick of people saying women only do this because jews wanted this or tptb wanted this. No. These types of women have always been this was and have always yelled at anyone who didnt give them what they wanted but in the past more of them died from stds or childbirth or they didnt have internet and couldnt read about current thing. Women have always been this way and always will be this way because it is their nature and the simp cuck incel enablers who think they will get a crumb of pussy for doing what women want are the reason this happens. Anyone living in portland knows how betafaggoty 99% of men here are. If you walk outside ever its impossible to not see it. But its those men going to abortion rallys those men supporting communism those men bragging about being in a one way open relationship those men being "allys" and "advocates" and "feminists" who hold this retarded gynocracy up. Thats the cold hard truth.

those are unworkable dead-end "solutions." they are offered by shills and intelligence assets to ensure that anons don't devote their energy to practical workable tactics to make a difference.

in order for a solution to be practical, it has to be something that people agree to work together on. broader coalitions are more stable and resilient. you don't have to go full DEI woke but at least putting together a workable proposal that meets peoples' basic needs and expectations goes a long way.

Despite globohomo going full throttle on every aspect of our lives, I can provide a valuable source of data. Gen Z, and younger specifically, are conservative and Christian as fuck. Despite having DEI shoved down their throats all day, I believe this pushes them radically the other way. This is my proof, I started this Catholic page not long ago, and within a couple weeks I have already nearly 90,000 people with Catholic related subjects. Despite all the shills, it is the young people who watch this content the most. 30% more than the other age groups.

No relationship is more primed for a reset right now than the one between America’s Blacks and Jews, who’ve seen their always-tenuous allyship stress-tested without reprieve since the Hamas attack on Israel last Oct. 7.

African-American pastors and #blacklivesmatter chapters have aligned themselves with Palestinian causes over their belief in a shared history of state-sanctioned violence and oppression. And Jewish groups have been left feeling abandoned and betrayed by many of the Black social justice causes they’ve championed so vocally.

Four months into a bloody war, the spiraling Gazan body count and ongoing tsunami of nationwide antisemitism have left both sides struggling to figure out what’s next. And that “next” is shaping up to be a very public confrontation over Jewish demands for safety and accountability — and demands from Black groups to maintain the diversity-driven status quo.

As someone who’s both Black and Jewish, I’ve never felt such a strong sense of dread over the rupture between my two communities. But far worse is the sense of peril I now feel as a Jew — and its eerie similarities to how I’ve long felt as a Black man in America. And diversity, equity and inclusion programs share much of the blame.

Both by practice and design, DEI excludes Jews from its protections throughout the workplace and academy. It frames us not only as the architects of the current antisemitism coursing all around us — due to our assumed privilege and the misguided assumption that being Jewish also means that we’re always white — but also deserving of its consequences, no matter how violent or bloody.

But this status quo actually presents an opportunity for a long overdue DEI rethink. And those of us who are both Black and Jewish are uniquely positioned to show how this might be achieved. Because to be both Black and Jewish in USA right now is to feel as if battles are raging all around — and you are permanently caught in the crossfire.

The problem for Western glowpig propagandists is that ideally you WANT a studious historically literate leader.

It doesn't even matter if what Putin said was true or just a narrative, he made the point that matters: He's a serious statesman, and he believes in his nation. Compare that with Western leaders who are senile or clinically retarded, half being DEI hires, and all being grossly incompetent, cynical hand-puppets of oligarchy that hate their own country (well, the White ones).

Good luck to the Judeo-American empire to put a lid on this one. Europe's half in open revolution, Americans are increasingly waiting for the civil war.

>Romans had a complex racial grading system.
The Roman's had a social vaste system that was more complex than even today's esg/dei programs. They didn't have a system of equity but one of effort and utility. The Roman's valued utility more than race. Their racial lense was shaped by their surrounding neighbors and trade partners. The Roman legal system was too complex for Roman's to use in a consistent manner so they relied on custom and utility. This is one of the reasons the fasche were so prominent in roman society as they were a simple idea that could be relied upon at a glance and any action that could be considered taboo could be answered with the removal of a fasche. Roman society was brutal and the law of the land was either Caesar or the senate. Most people would rather rely on Caesar. An army is less prone to waste than a system of hereditary plantation owners.

Tran? Phu-Bin? Patel? Jamal? What the hell. Yes, they've been DEI.
